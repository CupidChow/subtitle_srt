LAST WEEK'S ONE-ON-ONE DATE
WITH CHANGSUN

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,276
FULLY PREPARED

3
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,147
<i>I prepared a date Yeeun would like.</i>
<i>Spicy</i> tteokbokki<i>.</i>

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:18,618
<i>If we make it together,</i>
<i>we'll become closer.</i>

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,622
<i>Changsun is very… attentive and caring.</i>

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,625
-All done.
-I'll try it.

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,196
-It's tasty.
-Is it tasty?

8
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,698
-Thank goodness.
-It's really spicy.

9
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,833
…if you choose me.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,668
I'll make it for you if you choose me.

11
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,072
<i>It was fun. Time passed very quickly.</i>

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,375
ONE-ON-ONE DATE
WITH CHANGSUN ENDS

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,678
LAST DATE,
A ONE-ON-ONE DATE WITH SUNGJUN

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,581
<i>A one-on-one date will go on</i>
<i>for 30 minutes.</i>

15
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,250
<i>If the date is fun,</i>

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,852
<i>Yeeun can extend it</i>
<i>by 10 minutes at a time,</i>

17
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,955
<i>up to a maximum of 30 minutes.</i>

18
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,126
<i>Who will be</i>
<i>Yeeun's final romantic interest?</i>

19
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,961
"WHO WILL BE YEEUN'S
FINAL ROMANTIC INTEREST?"

20
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,497
-Do you know where we're going now?
-No.

21
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,632
-Not at all?
-That's right.

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,567
I'll tell you once we're outside.

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,305
"SUNGJUN AND YEEUN SET OUT TO THE
LOCATION OF THE ONE-ON-ONE DATE"

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,411
-Would you like a candy?
-Yes.

25
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,113
Thank you.

26
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,917
There's jelly as well!
Is this gum or jelly?

27
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,118
Too many came out.

28
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,622
-May I eat it?
-Yes, of course.

29
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,259
It's really tasty.

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,763
I wish it were far. It's too bad
that the ride only takes 10 minutes.

31
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,565
-You've driven a lot, right?
-No.

32
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,600
Not since that <i>Running Man</i> episode.

33
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,935
I watched that episode.

34
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,770
It was my first time driving
after getting a driver's license.

35
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,804
-The very first time?
-Yes.

36
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,272
I was breaking out in a cold sweat.

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,443
I was the same when I met you
for the first time.

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,347
I was breaking out in a cold sweat.

39
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,149
-Sungjun, you must be nervous.
-Good.

40
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,251
-You're sweating so much.
-I usually don't sweat.

41
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,886
-But I'm sweating so much.
-You're…

42
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,921
"DURING THE BLIND DATE"

43
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,124
I sweat every time I see you, Yeeun.

44
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,359
"SUNGJUN DIDN'T STOP SWEATING"

45
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,861
I usually don't sweat much.

46
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,462
I think you sweat a lot.

47
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,930
No, I usually don't sweat much.

48
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,299
It must be because I'm nervous
from meeting you.

49
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,734
It's a good thing then.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,876
<i>Shall we put on some background music?</i>

51
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,750
"SUNGJUN'S CHOICE,
'MILK SHAKE' BY CHOONGJU JI-C"

52
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,052
-I had only listened to snippets of it.
-Yes.

53
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,988
-Then I listened to it many times.
-It's good, right?

54
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,055
It's good.

55
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,091
-It's good when the weather is nice.
-That's right.

56
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,326
-Let's go.
-<i>Drink a milkshake</i>

57
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,996
-Did you see the hand gestures?
-Of course.

58
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,297
We danced together back then.

59
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,331
-Right.
-Yes.

60
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,399
-You remember, right?
-Yes.

61
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,836
<i>In my mouth</i>

62
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,640
When you listen to it,

63
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,909
-it's a feel-good song.
-It really is.

64
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,279
Yeeun, is there anything
you want to learn for fun?

65
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,346
For fun?

66
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,649
I don't know. For fun…

67
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,751
We're actually going to a place…

68
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,387
where you can learn pottery.

69
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,257
I prepared a pottery studio date.

70
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,458
"WHAT KIND OF A DATE
DID YOU PREPARE?"

71
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,094
<i>I've done pottery for a few years now.</i>

72
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,797
I learned that it was

73
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,199
very therapeutic.

74
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,068
I think it'll be very nice
to do it with Yeeun.

75
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,870
We can talk too.

76
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,638
Yeeun isn't familiar with the activity,

77
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,407
so she won't forget about it.

78
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,909
Then she won't forget about me.

79
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,181
What do you want to make?
You can make a cup or a yogurt bowl.

80
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,217
You can also make a bowl.

81
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,122
-Have you made a pottery item?
-Of course.

82
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,290
-Really?
-Yes.

83
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,825
You must be good at it.

84
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,994
-I'm good at handicrafts.
-Really?

85
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,096
I'm good at making things.

86
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,998
It'll be bad if you're too good at it.

87
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,366
Why?

88
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,635
-If the first item comes out well…
-Okay.

89
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,204
You won't do it again with me.

90
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,812
Ta-da!

91
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,648
"SUNGJUN'S ONE-ON-ONE DATE,

<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

93

94
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,461
-<i>Kim Sungjun, begins now!</i>
-We made a reservation as a couple.

95
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,199
-You reserved the wheels, right?
-Yes, for two.

96
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,901
Come this way. The aprons are ready.

97
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,305
-How pretty!
-Pick an apron that suits your taste

98
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,607
and put it on.
Then I'll direct you to the wheels.

99
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,775
-This one…
-Yeeun, I'll pick yours.

100
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,243
Okay.

101
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,911
-How about a pink one?
-Okay.

102
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,748
I'll pick yours.

103
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,849
Sounds good.

104
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,950
Wear this one.

105
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,718
-The orange one?
-Yes.

106
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,154
I'll help you put it on.

107
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,222
Thank you.

108
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,159
Shouldn't I wear it like this?

109
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,829
-Really?
-Maybe not.

110
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,934
Is this good?

111
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,903
-Nice.
-Does it feel okay?

112
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,271
Yes.

113
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,339
Let me see.

114
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,245
-Like this.
-Yes.

115
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,117
-Don't make it tight.
-But this… Okay.

116
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,419
-Don't make it tight.
-Okay.

117
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,953
That's good.

118
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,355
-That's good.
-Okay.

119
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,557
-This way. I'll direct you to the wheels.
-It looks fun.

120
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,259
Are those the wheels?

121
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,098
-It's your very first time, right?
-Yes.

122
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,366
What do you want to make today?

123
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,668
Dishware. A plate.

124
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,104
Why don't we make cups
and use them to drink coffee together?

125
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,539
"WHY DON'T WE MAKE CUPS
AND DRINK COFFEE TOGETHER?"

126
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,606
A cup.

127
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,575
You use a cup more often

128
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,277
since you drink coffee and water with it.

129
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,480
I chose to make a cup
so that she'd think of me with each use.

130
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,817
Have you ever received
a handmade item as a present?

131
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,720
-No.
-A scarf or…

132
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,521
I've never received a hand-knitted scarf.

133
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,157
-Let's make it for each other.
-Okay.

134
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,194
-Spin the wheel slowly.
-Okay.

135
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,261
Is it spinning?

136
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,499
Feel the speed and texture first.

137
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,768
-Feel the speed and texture first.
-Be careful.

138
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,604
-If you sprinkle too much water…
-It's actually spinning.

139
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,540
…and spin the wheel fast,
it'll splatter on your face.

140
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,608
-Gently.
-Yes.

141
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,677
-I can't control it.
-Be careful.

142
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,845
Watch.

143
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,747
-Sprinkle it only on the top.
-Only on the top.

144
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,849
-Otherwise, it'll splatter.
-Okay.

145
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,384
-It'll splatter.
-Yes.

146
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,187
-And…
-<i>Yeeun, 10 minutes passed.</i>

147
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,255
Already?

148
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,356
-You start there.
-Yes.

149
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,991
-The bottom.
-Bring your hands up.

150
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,960
-Push it up like this.
-You start from the bottom.

151
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,762
-Yes.
-You push it up from the bottom.

152
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,363
-You push it up like this.
-Yes.

153
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,634
Am I pushing it up?

154
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,470
-Let me take a look. Hold on.
-Why can't I push it up?

155
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,140
Put your hands on the bottom, not the top.

156
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,509
Then push it up like this.

157
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,047
-Do you apply pressure?
-Yes.

158
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,115
-You apply pressure.
-But

159
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,084
apply the same amount of pressure
from both sides.

160
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,357
-Why can't I do it?
-What?

161
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,725
Why can't I make a hole?

162
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,894
Let me see.

163
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,462
I need to press harder than I thought.

164
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,863
Press with your thumb.

165
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,433
Press harder than you'd think you should.
Like this.

166
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,771
Afterward,
do what our instructor did earlier.

167
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,174
Nice. I want to try myself.

168
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,743
Like this.

169
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,550
-Let's make one first and…
-Okay.

170
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,651
What should I do?

171
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,619
What should I do?

172
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,855
-Should I press it?
-Spin it. Yes, spin it.

173
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,723
Keep going.

174
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,261
You can use a sponge
to gently dab on the top.

175
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,863
-You're really good at this.
-It looks okay, right?

176
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,431
Yes. You're really good at this.

177
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,499
Good.

178
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,969
This is…

179
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,070
It's spinning too fast.

180
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,272
Hold it securely like this.

181
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,874
Keep it steady.

182
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,210
Put your hand here and spin the wheel.

183
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
Keep going.

184
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,452
I need to be careful.

185
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,753
Press downward. Keep going.

186
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,988
That's it.

187
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,890
Slowly.

188
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,161
There you go. Slowly.

189
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,229
I'm sweating.

190
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,631
Seriously.

191
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,666
I'll go back to making my gift for you.

192
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,636
This is actually therapeutic.

193
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,238
-It's therapeutic, right?
-Yes.

194
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,378
<i>Three minutes remain.</i>

195
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,983
-Right now…
-<i>If you want to extend the date,</i>

196
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,987
<i>please say, "I'll add 10 more minutes."</i>

197
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,223
We have a lot to do, so that'll be good.

198
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,459
We have a lot to do,
so let's add 10 more minutes.

199
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,394
Let's make another one after this.

200
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,198
Let's try hand-building too.

201
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,901
So… Hand-building?

202
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,370
I'll add 10 more minutes.

203
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,277
-How much have you done?
-I think I'm done.

204
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,646
How does it look?

205
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,447
-You did a great job.
-Really?

206
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,049
-Yes.
-Good.

207
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,553
You did an amazing job.

208
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,455
-I made a designed cup.
-A designed cup.

209
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,791
Let's try hand-building now.

210
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,859
Hand-building.

211
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,327
I'll direct you to the area.

212
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,828
I really want to try hand-building.

213
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,530
-Hand-building.
-Come this way.

214
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,332
Have you tried hand-building?

215
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,868
It's my first time. I'm in trouble.

216
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,936
"SUNGJUN HASN'T TRIED IT EITHER"

217
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,471
It'll be fun. I like this.

218
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,540
I think you'll have to add
30 more minutes.

219
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
What's the easiest to make
by hand-building?

220
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,646
-A plate is the easiest to make.
-A plate?

221
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,081
Shall we make a plate this time?

222
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,783
I'll make a sauce bowl.

223
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,356
Let's make a sauce bowl.

224
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,757
Let's make something we'll use.

225
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,960
-If we don't use it, it'll be a burden.
-Okay.

226
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,362
-All right.
-This is incredible.

227
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,764
Hand-building is more fun.

228
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,500
-Right?
-We can play around with clay.

229
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,403
-I think it'll relieve stress.
-Yes.

230
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,976
I'll shape it like a cat.

231
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,310
Make two and give me one.

232
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,579
Okay. I'll give you one.

233
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,681
I'll do the same. I'll make a heart.

234
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,188
Do you prefer mustard or ketchup?

235
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,257
I like both mustard and ketchup.

236
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,627
I'll put a divider in the middle.

237
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,161
Mustard and ketchup.

238
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,264
I'll make it pretty.

239
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,003
I'm determined to do well.

240
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,741
-Isn't it better than exercising?
-Why is it… Totally!

241
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,743
Thank goodness
I didn't go down that route.

242
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,480
This is the kind of activity I enjoy.

243
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,448
I originally wanted to exercise with you.

244
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,916
It would've ended badly.

245
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,354
Seriously, I feel like…

246
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,923
I'll think of this later.

247
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,693
You're good at this.

248
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,927
-Right?
-Yes.

249
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,330
-I think it'll be pretty when it's baked.
-I think so too.

250
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,500
This is fun.

251
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,536
This is so fun.

252
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,573
-<i>Three minutes remain.</i>
-Oh, no.

253
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,909
I'll make yours in three minutes.

254
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,312
-Weren't you on your second one?
-No.

255
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,647
-No.
-I mean…

256
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,449
You promised to give me one!

257
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,517
Hurry up and make it.

258
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,885
We only have three minutes.

259
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,186
-Hold on.
-Seriously.

260
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,923
Wrap that up and make another one, okay?

261
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:36,495
<i>If you want to extend the date,</i>
<i>please say, "I'll add 10 more minutes."</i>

262
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,697
-Shall we say it together?
-Yes.

263
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,932
-One, two, three. Ten more minutes.
-Ten more minutes.

264
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,968
That was great.

265
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,036
That was nice.

266
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,971
We're finally
on the same wavelength today.

267
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,808
-We'll have a one-hour date at this rate.
-<i>Ten minutes have been added.</i>

268
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,743
<i>Please continue on with the date.</i>

269
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,345
I'll make yours now.

270
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,747
You can make a smaller one.

271
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,048
-A smaller one?
-Yes.

272
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,551
-Hurry up.
-I'll make it in no time.

273
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,885
I've gotten used to it,

274
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,120
-so it won't take long.
-Okay.

275
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,290
How am I so good at it?

276
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,493
It's cute.

277
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,128
-It looks good.
-Right?

278
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,496
It's pretty. I'm going to make…

279
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>Three minutes remain.</i>

280
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,468
<i>If you want to extend the date</i>
<i>one last time,</i>

281
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,703
<i>please say, "I'll add 10 more minutes."</i>

282
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,438
<i>If you want to end the date,</i>

283
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,341
<i>please say, "See you in a bit."</i>

284
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,176
Are you good at drawing?

285
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,179
-Why do you ask?
-If you're good at it,

286
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,481
it'll be nice to draw on this.

287
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,550
-It'd be cute if I added a drawing.
-Yes.

288
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,420
-Can you draw?
-You should color and draw on your work.

289
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,623
<i>Yeeun, please answer</i>
<i>on the count of three.</i>

290
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,458
-<i>One, two…</i>
-You should do this too.

291
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,926
<i>…three.</i>

292
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,428
I'll add 10 more minutes.

293
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,832
Such precious 10 minutes.

294
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,935
<i>Ten minutes have been added.</i>

295
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,205
He was so strategic.

296
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,175
You can't finish making
pottery in 30 minutes.

297
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,912
Even an hour isn't enough.

298
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,114
I wanted to keep going, to be honest.

299
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,315
I wanted to stay longer.

300
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,484
I was so happy when she added 10 minutes.

301
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,321
Seriously, I'll make a pretty one for you.

302
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,194
-This is so much fun.
-I know.

303
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,763
-Time passed quickly, right?
-Yes.

304
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,065
This is the best…

305
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,567
This is the best date.

306
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,202
Thank you.

307
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,771
Thank you.

308
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,510
-I did an amazing job.
-You did.

309
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,245
I really like that one.

310
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,480
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

311
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,816
-Don't throw it away.
-Of course, I won't.

312
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,652
How's this? It's a heart.

313
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,124
What are you going to do?

314
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,826
-I mean…
-What will you do about that?

315
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:47,993
What are you going to do?

316
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,728
-I mean…
-What will you do about that?

317
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,831
Mustard goes in here
and ketchup goes in here.

318
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,966
You won't throw it away, right?

319
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,537
-Answer me.
-I won't throw it away.

320
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,140
I did a good job.

321
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,309
I think I did a good job.

322
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,044
How cute!

323
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,545
I'm done.

324
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm done too.

325
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,949
<i>Three minutes remain.</i>

326
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,785
This is my first time in a pottery studio.

327
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
It's so much fun. I don't want to leave.

328
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,588
-Really?
-Yes.

329
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,389
I want to make more.

330
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,825
It's so much fun.

331
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,660
Thank you.

332
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,929
It was our first time doing

333
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,564
-a serious activity together.
-Yes.

334
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,499
I think that was very meaningful.

335
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,301
We stayed serious,

336
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,138
-but there was laughter as well.
-Yes, it was so much fun.

337
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,240
-It was nice.
-Yes.

338
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,175
-Thank you.
-Okay.

339
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,243
Let's meet again.

340
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,510
Let's meet again.

341
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,013
-Let's meet again.
-Let's meet again.

342
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,115
I'll extend the date
by one or two hours then.

343
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,985
<i>Yeeun, all the dates have ended.</i>

344
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,554
<i>Please proceed to the location</i>
<i>of the final decision.</i>

345
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,190
-It was so much fun. Seriously.
-We've done so much.

346
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,858
It was so fun.
