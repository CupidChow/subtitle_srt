1
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:07,474
Do you remember me?

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,009
Do you remember me?

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,076
Yes, I do.

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,479
You haven't forgotten about me.

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,713
We've met once.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,682
How do you guys know each other?

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,751
We've met once.

8
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,887
-At a private gathering,
-You guys know each other.

9
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,555
-we've met once.
-We've met once.

10
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:23,556
A private gathering?

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,458
-You know,
-A private gathering.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,293
Was it last year or the year before?

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,595
-It was last year.
-No way.

14
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:29,863
It was last October.

15
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,333
We happened to have

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,367
a mutual friend.

17
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,204
"He's a fan of yours.
Let's meet up together."

18
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,073
So we had a meal together.

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,208
I asked her for her number

20
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,476
and got her KakaoTalk ID.

21
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,146
I'm impressed with Jongwoo.

22
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,680
I messaged her and asked

23
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,417
if she got home okay.

24
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,385
We exchanged messages a few times.

25
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,321
-But she was busy with <i>Running Man</i>.
-Right.

26
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,589
-I was very busy then.
-Yes.

27
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,959
You never check if I got home okay
after we meet up.

28
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,197
I only do it for someone I like.

29
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,836
I had a feeling

30
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,472
that I'd only be able to meet her again

31
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,542
in a public setting,
not a private setting.

32
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,045
So I plucked up my courage and came here.

33
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,018
I went through our KakaoTalk messages
before coming here.

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,221
I checked when the last message was.

35
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,722
Since she's a superstar,

36
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,492
-our chat room must be at the very bottom.
-Right.

37
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,394
I don't check KakaoTalk very often.

38
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,529
That's how an ISFP is.

39
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,098
I'm an ISFP.

40
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,534
They don't check KakaoTalk.

41
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,136
They're homebodies.

42
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,604
They need their alone time.

43
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,972
That's incredible.

44
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,777
This is driving me crazy.

45
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,345
What's this?

46
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,380
I know everything.

47
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,917
That's funny. This is fun.

48
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,186
Jongwoo.

49
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,491
<i>Two minutes have passed.</i>

50
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,658
He needs coffee.

51
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,660
-Coffee.
-May I have a drink? I'm so… Yes.

52
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,595
I'm so nervous.

53
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,964
-Americano?
-One Americano, please.

54
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,332
How about Yongwoo?

55
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,935
"YONGWOO FINISHED HIS DRINK
DUE TO NERVOUSNESS"

56
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,937
-Yongwoo.
-Well…

57
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,673
-do you mind if I use the restroom?
-Can he?

58
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,408
-The restroom?
-Is it not allowed?

59
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,044
<i>Time will continue to pass</i>
<i>even as you use the restroom.</i>

60
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,447
Will time continue to pass?
Then I'll stay.

61
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,918
But you need to use the restroom.
Will you be okay?

62
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,920
-It's okay.
-Oh, no.

63
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,155
No, it's okay.

64
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,857
We used to talk casually
with each other.

65
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,959
Really?

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,228
But I'll go back to being polite.

67
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,964
I'll call her "Ms. Yeeun," not "<i>nuna</i>."

68
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,167
This is driving me crazy.

69
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,637
Shall I call you "<i>nuna</i>"?

70
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,273
You have two younger brothers,

71
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,742
so I don't want to call you that.

72
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,112
How do you know all that, Jongwoo?

73
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,049
Ms. Yeeun.

74
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:10,790
You're daring.

75
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,959
-Be more like this when you play soccer.
-I'm serious.

76
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,661
I'm here because I really like you.

77
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,366
-It's more nerve-racking than a match.
-He isn't like that when he plays soccer.

78
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,568
Nice to see you again.

79
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,704
What am I supposed to do?
This is driving me crazy.

80
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,811
Gyumin looked at me a lot,

81
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,247
but Jongwoo has no intention
to look at me.

82
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,315
Right.

83
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,518
"JONGWOO'S EYES ARE FIXED ON YEEUN"

84
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,454
-I keep looking at his side profile.
-I see you often anyway.

85
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,690
You're handsome, Jongwoo.

86
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,860
Do you want to ask her any questions?

87
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,463
-We've already talked for an hour.
-That's right.

88
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,898
Is there nothing else…

89
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,467
There's more to talk about,
but Jongwoo just got here, so…

90
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,803
You know,

91
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,139
I truly regret to say this.

92
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,342
But I'll need to use the restroom
real quick.

93
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,111
-<i>Please go ahead.</i>
-I'll be quick.

94
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,613
Where is the restroom?

95
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,847
I'll be back.

96
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,948
It's good for me.

97
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,184
It's good for me.

98
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,719
-We'll be alone.
-Right.

99
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,894
How have you been?

100
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,598
I told you back then
that I was on a soccer show.

101
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,600
…that I was on a soccer show.

102
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,404
I go to my cafe from time to time

103
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,039
to make coffee for the customers.

104
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,544
I'd think about you from time to time too.

105
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,848
What's wrong with you?

106
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,551
But I'm being sincere.

107
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,620
I'm serious.

108
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,790
I see that you took good care
of your looks.

109
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,058
Back then…

110
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,559
Was I chubby back then?

111
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,128
No, you weren't chubby.

112
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,096
You were wearing casual clothes.

113
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,300
-I was wearing casual clothes.
-Yes.

114
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,635
I'm going on blind dates today.

115
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,104
-So you dressed up.
-Your <i>nuna </i>dressed for the occasion.

116
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,306
Not <i>nuna</i>. It's Ms. Yeeun.

117
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,243
Ms. Yeeun.

118
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,080
Gosh! What's up with him?

119
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,616
This is quite nerve-racking.
I didn't expect to be nervous

120
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,484
since we've met before.

121
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,552
But I'm nervous.

122
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,187
Seriously.

123
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,956
I messaged you and asked
if you'd like to have a meal with me.

124
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,860
You said you were busy
and you'd already had a sandwich.

125
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,630
-Geez.
-You said you wouldn't have a meal.

126
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,198
I got rejected once then.

127
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,068
Why are you bringing up such a thing?

128
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,369
Don't edit out anything.

129
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,105
You're so determined.

130
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm serious about you.

131
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,610
I thought today would be my only chance,

132
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,613
-so I came here with renewed confidence.
-Seriously.

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,282
You're full of confidence.

134
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,683
It's nice.

135
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,885
Don't I seem different now?

136
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,488
You seem very confident now.

137
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,190
"HE CAME BACK IN TWO MINUTES"

138
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,692
You didn't look me in the eye back then.

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,227
-You didn't.
-I didn't?

140
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,629
You kept looking down.

141
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,031
"YONGWOO LOST TWO MINUTES"

142
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,436
You were leaning forward so much just now.

143
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,205
I just like her that much.

144
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,541
What's wrong with him?

145
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,542
I'm not playing around.

146
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,978
I'm being genuine about how I feel.

147
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,014
I'm usually not that confident.

148
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,550
I think you're confident.
You seem full of confidence.

149
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,585
No.

150
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,853
No.

151
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,554
I'm not usually like this.

152
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,156
Yongwoo knows me.

153
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,224
I'm not sure if I do.

154
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,264
Have you dated someone
who was younger or older than you?

155
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,266
Have you dated someone with an age gap?

156
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,503
FOUR YEARS OLDER
VERSUS FOUR YEARS YOUNGER

157
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,472
I've dated both someone younger
and someone older.

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,142
Thank goodness.

159
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,543
How much of an age gap can you allow?

160
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,181
Is the question too detailed?

161
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,951
Watch yourself!

162
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,853
-Watch yourself!
-Okay. I'll watch myself.

163
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,890
-I'll watch myself. Okay.
-Watch yourself!

164
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,394
The two of you got to talk
before I arrived.

165
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,196
Anything you have in common?

166
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,266
Both of us like to have fun.

167
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,967
Both of us like to have fun.

168
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,537
He practically confessed his love

169
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,905
to me.

170
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,409
Really?

171
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,178
You were worse than me.

172
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,913
That was why you've stayed quiet.

173
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,451
That's hilarious.

174
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,120
It was practically…

175
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,857
I see.

176
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,091
…a confession of love.

177
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,128
Basically a love confession?

178
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,263
She likes staying at home.

179
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,498
-Stuff like that.
-Right.

180
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,799
She's a homebody.

181
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,403
Do you guys like the same kind of food?

182
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,704
I like all sorts of food.

183
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,406
She likes all sorts of food.

184
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,809
-I like all sorts of bread.
-You like bread.

185
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,611
-Cakes.
-Cakes.

186
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,513
-Brownies.
-Brownies.

187
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,882
-Bagels.
-Bagels.

188
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,317
-Baguettes.
-Baguettes.

189
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,385
-You like all sorts of bread.
-Yes.

190
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,753
Do you like salted butter rolls?

191
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,288
-I love them.
-It's nice.

192
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,524
We sell them at my café.

193
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,425
I see.

194
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,327
When you have the time,

195
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,695
you should visit.

196
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,797
He's flirting again.

197
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,733
-It'd be nice.
-Gosh, Jongwoo.

198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,869
-You're really smooth.
-You can have them to-go.

199
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,170
You're good.

200
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,805
-Play soccer this way.
-You've improved.

201
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,207
You've improved.

202
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,742
Don't say that. I'm serious now.

203
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,179
This situation is a bit more uncomfortable
since we're close.

204
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,413
I see.

205
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,916
If we were strangers,

206
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,718
I would be more forward.

207
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,686
More forward?

208
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,221
-More forward?
-More forward?

209
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,823
-Yes.
-Jongwoo.

210
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,858
Is it even possible to be more forward?

211
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,059
Jongwoo.

212
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,061
-He's impressive.
-Jongwoo.

213
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,564
This man is impressive.

214
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,199
He's impressive.

215
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,068
Jongwoo.

216
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,504
On a different show, you said

217
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,940
that you were too busy and exhausted

218
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,842
even though you wanted to date someone.

219
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,710
Keeping in contact feels like a hassle,

220
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,146
so you just wanted to rest at home.

221
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,315
-You said that on another show.
-That's right.

222
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,183
Do you want a relationship now?

223
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,452
-I think it's about time.
-I see.

224
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
The production crew

225
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,623
created this show for me.

226
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,025
This show.

227
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,226
"This show is like a present."

228
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,562
-I see.
-"This show is like a present to you."

229
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,097
"We're like a matchmaking company, Duo."

230
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,165
-Duo.
-A matchmaking company,

231
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,133
-Duo.
-Duo.

232
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,267
"They're our acquaintances."

233
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,535
-They said that.
-Acquaintances.

234
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,970
I'm very grateful.

235
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,607
-They made this show for me.
-You're right.

236
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,409
You're definitely a superstar.

237
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,945
Not a superstar.

238
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,647
-I'm more of a rising star.
-A rising star.

239
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,150
You're more of a rising star.

240
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,318
A rising star.

241
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,789
-Time flies by.
-You know,

242
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,291
-you made 20 minutes pass
-Seriously.

243
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,826
-in a blur.
-It passes quickly.

244
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,562
-Five minutes remain.
-I shouldn't have gone to the restroom.

245
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,100
Time passed in a blur.

246
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,605
-My absence became his booster.
-That was my opportunity.

247
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,573
Jongwoo went all out while I was gone.

248
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,674
It became his booster.

249
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,846
What kind of man do you like?

250
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,047
A kind man.

251
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,349
A kind man.

252
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,317
How about physical appearance?

253
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,987
I don't care so much
about physical appearance.

254
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,121
You don't?

255
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,924
I guess it depends on who's more forward.

256
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,293
It comes down to who's more
forward with his feelings.

257
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,562
Those things

258
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,398
could sway your heart, Ms. Yeeun.

259
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,000
-Ms. Yeeun.
-What's up with "Ms. Yeeun"?

260
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,534
What's up with "Ms. Yeeun"?

261
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,936
It's so strange.

262
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,472
I might not get to see you again
after today.

263
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,675
May I call you "Yeeun"?

264
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,743
Oh, my.

265
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,944
Oh, my.

266
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,345
What am I supposed to do?

267
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,581
This is driving me crazy.

268
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,621
What am I supposed to do?

269
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,223
I don't know what to do.

270
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,993
I asked because I was nervous.

271
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,063
I wanted to tell you how I really feel.

272
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,099
<i>One minute remains.</i>

273
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,267
My goodness.

274
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,071
Time passed so quickly.

275
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,676
Gosh, Jongwoo.

276
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,379
Time passed so quickly.

277
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,681
After Jongwoo came,

278
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,550
I felt like the timer was going
twice as fast.

279
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,719
-Time passed more quickly than before.
-I know.

280
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,920
He's impressive.

281
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,224
I'm not doing this for the show.
In all seriousness…

282
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,228
I came to express my feelings.

283
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,497
I might not get to see you again.

284
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,398
Right.

285
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,402
So I wanted to express

286
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,738
-my feelings.
-Jongwoo's been rejected once.

287
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,274
I don't want to experience that again.

288
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,844
It's understandable.

289
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,848
I had no idea,

290
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,217
so I'm very flustered right now.

291
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,520
I didn't expect this to happen
on the very first day.

292
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,323
But I'll leave it up

293
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,560
to your decision
and respect it, Ms. Yeeun.

294
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,228

295
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,196

00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,197

<i>one.</i>

299
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

300
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,003
TWO-ON-ONE BLIND DATE ENDS

301
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,774
Seriously!

302
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,745

<i>Please get up and move</i>
<i>to the back of the man of your choice.</i>

306
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,957
This is really hard.

307
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,191
So this is how it is.

308
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,195
"NERVOUS"

309
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,798
-For real.
-Seriously, this is…

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,638
"COMPLETELY TORN"

00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,074
Geez…

313
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,477
What am I supposed to do?

314
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,791
<i>Now, put your hand</i>
<i>on the shoulder of the man you'd like</i>

316
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,564
He practically confessed his love to me.

"YONGWOO CONFESSED HIS LOVE TO YEEUN"

318

319

May I call you "Yeeun"?

320
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,875
Oh, my.

321
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,310
What am I supposed to do?

322
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,445
This is driving me crazy.

323
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,380

-Jongwoo.

-All right.

<i>One-on-one date begins now.</i>

I was very flustered earlier.

353
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,366
I could see that you were flustered.

354
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,500
I was flustered too.

-Right.
-That's why.

-Really? Why not?
-After all,

359
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,778
your younger brother
was born in 1997.

360
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
I was born in 1998.

361
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,248
-So…
-You know so much.

362
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,717
I thought you'd only see me
as a younger brother.

363
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,221
I thought you'd choose Yongwoo,
who's older than you.

364
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,390
It was a bit of a surprise.

365
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,592
-I like a man who likes me.
-I see.

366
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,494
I could feel

367
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,196
that you liked me more.

368
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,967
-Of course.
-So…

369
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,036
That's why I chose you.

370
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,438
I'll show you more.

371
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,207
It might be too much, though.

372
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,178
I'm more nervous
now that we're by ourselves.

373
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,613
-Really?
-Yes.

374
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,949
-Don't lie.
-I'm serious.

375
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,283
You don't seem very nervous.

376
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,185
I'm good at masking my nervousness.

377
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,787
My palms are very sweaty right now.

378
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,121
So…

379
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,159
How have you been?

380
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,329
I've been busy.

381
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,296
I've been working a lot.

382
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,833
-Work, home, work, home.
-Work, home.

383
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,602
I often watch the shows you're on.

384
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,939
You have a romantic interest
in every show.

385
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,908
I feel like

386
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,211
you could date one of them.

387
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,649
So I want to know why
you're on this show.

388
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,854
-It's hard to date someone from a show.
-Really?

389
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,622
Don't people fall for each other?

390
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,257
-Because it's work.
-I see.

391
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,258
-Then…
-It doesn't…

392
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,961
-People only see it as work.
-That's what you think.

393
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,730
I'm glad that you only see it as work.

394
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,702
You watched my shows?

395
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,603
Of course.

396
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,205
I watch your shows often.

397
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,407
Do you know about the song
I released recently?

398
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,144
Did she release a song?

399
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,145
"WHAT SONG?"

400
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,586
How could you not listen to my song
if you like me?

401
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,890
I'm sorry.
But it was released recently, right?

402
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,091
-That's right.
-Recently.

403
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,893
-If it's a summer song,
-It's a summer song.

404
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,328
is it like

405
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,963
<i>Prince of the Sea</i>?

406
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,231
It's called <i>Milk Shake</i>.

407
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,932
I'll look it up.

408
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,669
I thought you only did acting.

409
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,339
I didn't know that you sang as well.

410
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,507
Since I love to sing,

411
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,309
I began the project for fun.

412
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,211
-Then I actually released an album.
-I see.

413
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,946
-You love to sing.
-I love to sing.

414
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,281
I think you mentioned it then.

415
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,283
-Really?
-I asked you then.

416
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,851
-I love slow songs.
-That's right.

417
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,353
I told you this.

418
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,289
-Should I call it a shrill voice?
-A shrill voice.

419
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,025
I became obsessed with your shrill voice.

420
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,994
-You like my shrill voice.
-Yes.

421
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,362
I really like it.

422
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,365
I think you just like me.

423
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,833
"I THINK YOU JUST LIKE ME"

424
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,868
You're right. That's why I'm here.

425
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,737
It's better to be alone with you.

426
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,381
Our mutual friend arranged a meeting

427
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,483
since you were my fan.

428
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,051
-I didn't say I was a fan.
-Really?

429
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,088
I said that I liked someone like Ji Yeeun.

430
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,056
I didn't say that I was a fan.

431
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:11,957
Did you say that?

432
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,992
-I was asked what my ideal type is.
-Was it me?

433
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,462
-I showed your photo to our friend.
-Was it me?

434
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,130
-Yes. I showed your photo.
-No way.

435
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,131
-So…
-Why me?

436
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,333
You're cute,

437
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,035
funny, and witty.

438
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,436
You're a good judge of character.

439
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,772
And you're nice by nature.

440
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,741
I'm prettier in person.

441
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,810
-It's true.
-Right?

442
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,546
-I know what you like.
-What do I like?

443
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,014
Fried chicken, pizza,

444
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,683
<i>hoe</i>, pork belly…

445
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,886
I know that much.

446
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,787
Bread.

447
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,723
I like all sorts of food.

448
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,492
What's your absolute favorite?

449
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,593
-My absolute favorite?
-Yes.

450
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,430
That would be<i> tteokbokki</i>.

451
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,434
I'm good at making <i>tteokbokki</i>.

452
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,169
-Do you cook?
-Yes, I do.

453
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,770
-Later on…
-How do you do that?

454
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,240
When I get married,
my wife will like it if I cook.

455
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,741
Do you want to get married?

456
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,777
Of course, I want to get married.

457
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,479
You're still young.

458
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,747
I'm not that young.

459
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,516
"I'M NOT THAT YOUNG"

460
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,085
It seems like…

461
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,555
It seems like you only see me
as a younger brother.

462
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,625
Do you know how I saved you in KakaoTalk?

463
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,894
-Guess.
-Ji Yeeun <i>nuna</i>?

464
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,828
Correct.

465
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,631
But I plan to change it
to a three-syllable name.

466
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,201
It'll be "Ms. Yeeun."

467
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,803
Seriously, what's up with you?

468
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,006
-Well, now,
-Stop it already.

469
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,008
I said I won't call you "<i>nuna</i>" anymore.

470
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,944
Stop it already! What's wrong with you?

471
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,380
-I'm not doing this for the show.
-Are you doing this because it's…

472
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,814
I'm serious.

473
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,117
-Is it because you want to be a superstar?
-No.

474
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,085
I'm already pretty big.

475
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,523
-Do you want to be a meme?
-No!

476
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,261
-One minute remains.
-One minute.

477
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,162
"ONE MINUTE REMAINS"

478
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,298
I came here with determination.

479
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,432
You have a religion.

480
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,500
-Yes.
-You talked about

481
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,669
needing to go to church on Sundays.

482
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,003
Well…

483
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,807
I used to be an atheist.

484
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,143
I got this as a present recently.

485
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,045
"FLIRTING WITH RELIGION
ONE MINUTE BEFORE THE END"

486
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,781
-You're really doing it for the show!
-No!

487
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,449
I did bring this to impress you.

488
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,384
-<i>Nuna</i>… I mean, Ms. Yeeun…
-Seriously,

489
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,420
-do you want to go viral?
-No!

490
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,757
-You're quite ambitious, aren't you?
-No!

491
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,826
It isn't like that.

492
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,362
Dating me won't bring you fame.

493
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,030
They might make shorts out of this.

494
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,766
I'm sure of it.

495
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,335
You're a rising star, a superstar.

496
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,437
But I'm not after that.

497
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,840
I wore it because my friend gave it to me
as a present.

498
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,275
It happened to be a cross.

499
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,210
I knew about your religion,

500
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,379
so I thought, "If I wear this,"

501
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,515
"we'll have something to talk about."

502
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,384
"It'll make her see me in a good light."

503
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,919
That's why I'm wearing it.

504
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,554
Thank you.

505
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,122
-I could feel your sincerity.
-Yes.

506
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,158
I really came here to see you.

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,799
"ONE-ON-ONE DATE ENDS"

508
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,700

517
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,499
You seem familiar.

You brought something.

521
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,707
I came empty-handed.

522
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,076
Seriously.

523
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,814
I could see you two
were having a good time.

524
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,915
-You could?
-Yes.

525
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,750
So I wondered if it'd be possible

526
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,152
for me

527
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,753
to get involved.

528
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,355
Don't be like that.

529
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,560
I prepared a present.

530
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,895
What is it?

531
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,434
You look really pretty in person.
