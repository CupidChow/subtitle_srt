<i>Magician Lee Junhyung and</i>
<i>Restaurant Owner Ko Minsung have entered.</i>

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,255
-Before I take a seat…
-Okay.

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:13,556
I prepared a simple present.

00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:16,225
"LEE JUNHYUNG CAUGHT ATTENTION
WITH MAGIC TRICKS"

5
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:17,760
How was it?

6
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:20,897
Yeeun, for you,

7
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:23,366
I hired a magician today.

8
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,234
Let's go watch his show together sometime.

9
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,502
"KO MINSUNG STRUCK BACK WITH HIS WITS"

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,137
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,740
Yeeun chose Ko Minsung.

12
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:34,377
I could tell that you work very hard.
I found that attractive.

13
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:36,446
That was why I was curious about you.

14
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,081
"KO MINSUNG MADE HIS INTEREST CLEAR"

15
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:40,550
These days,
I'm obsessed with Chinese food.

16
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,452
So I can make you mala hot pot

17
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:45,088
for the rest of your life.

18
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:49,158
If you go to China with me…

19
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,461
We can eat many tasty dishes.

Hello.

Hello.

Hello.

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,231
Nice to meet you.

ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN YEEUN, ENTJ

32
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,106
-Hello.
-Okay.

33
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:41,244
My name is Cho Yeongseok,
and I'm a pharmacist based in Seoul.

34
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:44,213
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

35
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:46,349
-I run a mala hot pot restaurant.
-Okay.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,784
I'm Ko Minsung, and I was born in 1990.

37
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,020
-Ko Minsung. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

38
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,088
How old are you?

39
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,956
I was born in 1995.

40
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,827
-You were born in 1994.
-Yes.

41
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:02,265
Yeeun, I've brought you a small gift.

42
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:08,070
Oh, my. You shouldn't have.

43
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,405
-Would you like to take a look?
-What's this?

44
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:11,274
-It's nothing grand.
-Thank you.

45
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,811
-It's just…
-It's a pharmacist's gift.

46
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,647
Yes. There are probiotics and…

47
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:18,714
Yes, I know the brand.

48
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,484
-There are also vitamin gummies.
-Thank you.

49
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,586
-Thank you.
-I added something

50
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:26,689
since you use a shrill voice a lot.

51
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:29,759
-Oh, for my throat.
-Yes, that's right.

52
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:31,260
-My throat.
-Yes.

53
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,328
They're throat lozenges.

54
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,797
Since they're medicine,
you shouldn't take too many.

55
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,499
-For a sore throat…
-I take them like candies.

56
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,466
-Right.
-Is that bad?

57
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,802
You should only take up to five a day.

58
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,206
-Thank you.
-All right.

59
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:45,374
-So, you're a pharmacist.
-Yes.

60
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,247
-I have a personal question.
-Okay.

61
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,783
-After eating mala hot pot…
-Okay.

62
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,484
-…you can struggle with indigestion.
-Okay.

63
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,819
What should you take then?

64
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:02,191
Yeeun likes mala hot pot
and Chinese hot pot.

65
00:03:02,258 --> 00:03:03,826
I get stomachaches.

66
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,927
She gets stomachaches.

67
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:07,496
"HE ASKS A QUESTION FOR YEEUN,
WHO LOVES SPICY FOOD"

68
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,635
I woke up from sleep once
because of a stomachache.

69
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,503
-I felt like I had a knot in my stomach.
-I see.

70
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,938
Does that happen often?

71
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,773
I think so. It happens pretty often.

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,542
-Pretty often? In that case…
-Yes.

73
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,278
…you don't have a strong stomach.

74
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:25,881
-The best solution is to avoid spicy food.
-Right.

75
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,453
If your stomach hurts too much
after eating the dish,

76
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,255
you should take antacids.

77
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,990
-There are famous ones.
-A digestive drink.

78
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:37,059
Yes. Something like that.
They protect the stomach.

79
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:38,894
There are such products.

80
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,363
You take them before eating, right?

81
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,899
You can take them before or after eating.

82
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,167
Between meals. It doesn't matter.

83
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,036
-Collagen supplements…
-Okay.

84
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,804
The supplements?

85
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,773
They aren't necessary, right?

86
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:52,842
They do help.

87
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,178
But I personally don't think
that they'll make a major difference.

88
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,547
How about iron supplements?

89
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,650
You need to be careful about
taking iron supplements.

90
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:05,421
Taking too many supplements
will ruin the balance of the body.

91
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,023
-You take vitamins after a meal.
-Yes.

92
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,125
Vitamins get absorbed more easily
and you won't get a stomachache

93
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,793
if you take them after a meal.

94
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,896
-I guess it's because you're a pharmacist…
-I know.

95
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,031
…but you're very well-spoken.

96
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:17,266
I'll explain things in detail later.

97
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,135
-I've already explained a lot, though.
-I have so many questions.

98
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,870
-I like supplements.
-Really?

99
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:23,306
-Taking care of your health…
-I'm very interested in that.

100
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,310
This is very fascinating.

101
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,011
-I know.
-Why? Is this your first blind date?

102
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,980
I've been on many blind dates,

103
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,282
but a two-on-one date is new.

104
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,352
Oh, my! You've been on many blind dates!

105
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,055
I can't count the number of blind dates

106
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,122
I've been on.

107
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,624
You're an expert.

108
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,059
-No.
-Seriously. This is

109
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,361
the very first blind date
I've been on in my life.

110
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:47,430
Really?

111
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,232
I don't know what to do.

112
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,967
What are you supposed to do
on a blind date?

113
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:54,437
What were the two of you talking about?

114
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,771
-Mala hot pot.
-Mala…

115
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:57,873
-Mala hot pot?
-Yes.

116
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,777
Talking for a long time might get boring.

117
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,081
I prepared something fun.

118
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,315
What is it?

119
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:08,150
Do you want to hear it?

120
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,619
I'm obsessed with personality tests.

121
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,521
I love personality tests.

122
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,957
-This personality test is about dating.
-That sounds great.

123
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,194
-You need to use your imagination.
-My imagination.

124
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,729
-My imagination. Okay.
-Let's begin.

125
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:22,431
-Let's say that you have a partner.
-Okay.

126
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,500
-You're going to your partner's house.
-Okay.

127
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,569
-There are two paths you can take.
-Okay.

128
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,137
One is a main street

129
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,538
-and the other is an alley.
-Okay.

130
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:30,806
Which one will you take?

131
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,742
-I'll take the main street.
-The main street.

132
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,477
-Same here.
-The main street.

133
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,012
People who take the main street…

134
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,518
fall in love quickly.

135
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,091
People who take the alley

136
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:50,659
fall in love slowly.

137
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,261
Says who?

138
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:58,067
Someone I don't personally know
said so on YouTu**.

139
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,135
-But…
-You're rude.

140
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,071
-I think it makes sense. Let me finish.
-Okay.

141
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:04,974
On your way to your partner's house,
you come across a pretty fountain.

142
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,211
Will you hang out at the fountain
or head straight to your partner's place?

143
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,781
-I'll head straight to his place.
-I see. How about you?

144
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,283
-Same here.
-Really?

145
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,886
People who head straight
to their partner's house don't cheat.

146
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:18,821
People who hang out at the fountain cheat.

147
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,190
That's true.

148
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,592
I see. That might be true.

149
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,362
Neither of you will cheat.

150
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,230
-I'm totally like that.
-Right.

151
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,766
-The next one is the best.
-Okay.

152
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,134
Hurry up and tell us. This is fun.

153
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,440
You enter your partner's room
for the first time.

154
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,341
-For the first time?
-Yes, for the first time.

155
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:40,676
There are three strange things.

156
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,545
<i>-A red bed…</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

157
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,280
<i>…a blue desk,</i>

158
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:45,981
<i>-and yellow curtains.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

159
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:49,151
Which one of the three
would catch your eye first?

160
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,921
-The yellow curtains.
-The curtains?

161
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,523
-The red bed.
-The red bed?

162
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,561
What is it?

163
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:03,065
People who choose the red bed

164
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:07,436
focus on their partner's
physical appearance.

165
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,345
They prioritize the physical appearance.

166
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,886
People who choose the yellow curtains

167
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:28,357
focus on their partner's
background, family,

168
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,660
their parents' jobs,
how much money they'll inherit…

169
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:32,761
Yeongseok.

170
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,535
Get out. Seriously.

171
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,439
I chose the blue desk.

172
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,040
-Don't lie.
-It means the partner's personality.

173
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:49,945
It means that I focus on
my partner's personality.

174
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,648
Don't lie. You're just trying to make
yourself look good.

175
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,149
Don't lie.

176
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:58,521
But I admit that I care about looks.

177
00:07:58,587 --> 00:07:59,655
-Right.
-I'm like that.

178
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:01,757
I'm like that.

179
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:03,526
I'm not like that.

180
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,027
-Sorry.
-Yellow curtains.

181
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:07,396
I don't care about the person's
background or family.

182
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:09,064
I only care about who they are.

183
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,036
It's fun, right?

184
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,104
Yes.

185
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,275
It's fun.

186
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,776
-I mean…
-It's fun.

187
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,344
How did you memorize it?

188
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,046
-I just…
-It must be…

189
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,714
It must be Yeongseok's brain.

190
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:27,249
-It must be Yeongseok's brain.
-Yes.

191
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,884
That personality test was fun.

192
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:30,152
-It was fun, right?
-Yes.

193
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,421
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

194
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,124
Hip-hop is my favorite genre of music.

195
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,792
-You don't seem like the type.
-I know.

196
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,495
I enjoy writing lyrics.

197
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,829
Do you rap?

198
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,766
-What?
-Shall I freestyle?

199
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,568
Yes!

200
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,036
Yes!

201
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:48,938
Seriously.

202
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,205
You're brave.

203
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:52,274
You're brave.

204
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,409
Okay.

205
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,078
Firstly…

206
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:58,213
Yo, Yeeun!

207
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:00,149
Yo, Yeeun!

208
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,720
Let's get it!

209
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,856
<i>MC Zerostone in the building, mic check</i>

210
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,225
<i>You and I are feeling high right now</i>

211
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,361
<i>I want to know how you feel</i>

212
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:14,063
<i>I want to own your vibe</i>

213
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,998
<i>Show me your smile</i>

214
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,099
Let's get it!

215
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,834
Skrrt!

216
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:31,146
-Yeongseok.
-I…

217
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:35,884
Don't rap.

218
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,988
Okay! Let's get it!

219
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:41,390
Skrrt!

220
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,292
Skrrt!

221
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,563
How was it? It was all right, no?

222
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,766
You're the quintessential chaotic good.

223
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,968
-Chaotic good?
-The quintessential chaotic good.

224
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:54,737
People tell me that often.

225
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,272
-I also have a rapper name.
-Okay. What is it?

226
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,508
My name is Cho Yeongseok,

227
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,010
so my rapper name is MC Zerostone.

228
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,583
"Yeong" means "Zero"
and "Seok" means "Stone."

229
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,753
My name uses different Chinese characters,
but still, I'm MC Zerostone.

230
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,921
Zerostone. Okay.

231
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:15,658
Why do you like rapping?

232
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,395
It has that energy.

233
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:20,729
The honest energy.

234
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:23,565
I got to check out
many impressive performances today.

235
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:29,004
Today must be a day of performances.
A day of culture.

236
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,573
Just a moment ago, we had a magic show.

237
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,244
-Really? Are those from the magic show?
-I got them from the magician guy.

238
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,845
Today must be a day of culture.

239
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:40,082
Regarding the show you've just watched…
I apologize.

240
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,121
-Was that really a rap…
-Yes.

241
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,257
…you came up with?

242
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:49,858
Yes.

243
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:50,926
It took me two days.

244
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,661
-Two days?
-It took you two days.

245
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:54,797
The lyrics reflect how I feel.

246
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,499
Yeeun, I want to know how you feel.

247
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,068
Let's get it.

248
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,737
The title of the rap is <i>You and I</i>.

249
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:03,939
The lyrics are about

250
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:07,242
how I want to get to know you, Yeeun.

251
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,151
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

252
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,654
Time passed quickly thanks to you.

253
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:22,091
Did you always want to be a pharmacist?

254
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:23,225
No, not at all.

255
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,828
I wanted to be an actor.

256
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:30,099
Do you still want to take up acting?

257
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:33,035
I recently appeared in a short film

258
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:34,837
because of that.

259
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,272
That's what I like.

260
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,007
Being immersed in something.

261
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,677
Thinking and imagining

262
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,078
to transform into that character.

263
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,982
You're an actor.

264
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,984
So…

265
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,820
I've always liked watching you on TV.

266
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,122
-Really?
-Yes.

267
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:54,823
Thank you.

268
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,429
Do you want to be an actor or a rapper?

269
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,365
Me?

270
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,301
To be honest, I don't want to be
anything else at this point.

271
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,370
I'm very satisfied with my life.

272
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,972
I just…

273
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,941
I just live every day
without any thoughts.

274
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,144
-That's the best.
-Yes.

275
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:20,582
Is there anything
you want to do in the future?

276
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,684
I'm very satisfied
with where I am at right now.

277
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,987
It was my dream to open a restaurant.

278
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,522
-In the end, I achieved that.
-Right.

279
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:29,391
I'm doing what I've always wanted to do

280
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,027
and making money as a result.

281
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:34,863
So I'm very satisfied with my life.

282
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,131
I'm enjoying my life.

Oh, my. You shouldn't have.

298
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,414
-Would you like to take a look?
-What's this?

299
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,015
-It's nothing grand.
-Thank you.

300
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,452
-This personality test is about dating.
-That sounds great.

Firstly,

305
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,562
thirty minutes was too short.

306
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,099
But I still got to feel…
Shall I call it your energy?

307
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,102
I got to feel that, so it was nice.

308
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,738
I have many fun things lined up,

309
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:51,773
but I'll respect your decision.

310
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,376
-Okay.
-All right.

I'm obsessed with Chinese food.

So I can make you mala hot pot
for the rest of your life.

-After eating mala hot pot,
-Okay.

00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,093
-you can struggle with indigestion.
-Okay.

317

What should you take then?

318
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,396
Yeeun likes mala hot pot

I won't rap either.

00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:03,638
<i>One-on-one date with Cho Yeongseok</i>
<i>from</i> Couple Palace <i>begins now!</i>

352
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,743
How does it feel?
Did you know that I'd choose you?

353
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,746
No, not at all. I didn't see it coming.

354
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,781
Firstly,

355
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,282
thank you for choosing me.

356
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,817
-Okay.
-Okay.

357
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:17,886
You know, it's an honor.

358
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:20,322
It looked like
you had prepared many things.

359
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,993
May I call you <i>nuna</i>?

360
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,129
-Call me by my name.
-Okay.

361
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,297
-Okay. Let's talk casually.
-You can say, "Hey."

362
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,432
<i>Nuna</i>.

363
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:31,800
Okay, Yeongseok.

364
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,770
"THEY TALK CASUALLY WITH EACH OTHER
AS SOON AS THE ONE-ON-ONE DATE BEGINS"

365
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,638
-This is fun.
-This is fun. Seriously.

366
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,140
This is fun. I like this.

367
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,442
-It's comfortable. It's very…
-It's comfortable. A blind date…

368
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,644
Honestly speaking,
blind dates aren't my thing.

369
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,379
Did you act this way on other blind dates?

370
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,815
No, I didn't. I didn't prepare anything.

371
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,253
I prepared many things for today
since this blind date was special.

372
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:52,320
-Good job.
-Yes.

373
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:56,825
I also know how to read palms.

374
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,593
-Do you really know how to read palms?
-Yes.

375
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,895
-You aren't fooling around.
-No.

376
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,096
Show me your left palm.

377
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:03,465
Simply put,

378
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,634
there are the heart line,
wisdom line, and life line.

379
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,135
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

380
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,203
-So…
-How is my life line?

381
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,738
-Will I die soon?
-No.

382
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,706
You'll live a long and healthy life.

383
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,475
The line is connected to the end.

384
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,510
-Really? Are you certain?
-Yes. I'm certain.

385
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,080
When I look at your heart line,

386
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:20,582
there are fine lines around it.

387
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,384
It means that you feel emotions deeply.

388
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:23,785
And the wisdom line…

389
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,158
Don't try to be funny!

390
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,260
No, I…

391
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,563
-Be honest.
-I'm being honest.

392
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:36,231
-Be honest.
-Okay.

393
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:37,966
The middle one is the wisdom line.

394
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:40,335
My wisdom line is long, okay?
Don't be ridiculous.

395
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:41,603
The length isn't the issue.

396
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,339
-Whether it's straight or curved…
-Mine is curved.

397
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,308
-How should I put it?
-I'm actually a genius.

398
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,910
Yours is defined without any fine lines.

399
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:51,346
When you need to make a judgment…

400
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,548
You make good judgments.

401
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,083
Seriously, I'm wise.

402
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:57,652
I just remembered something.

403
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,588
-I prepared one more thing.
-What is it?

404
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:03,391
-What's that?
-I got it at a stationery store.

405
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,027
-It looks fun.
-We can use

406
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:08,263
these cards to get to know each other.

407
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,566
I also wrote down
some questions I had too.

408
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,768
How fascinating.
I didn't know they sold such products.

409
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,707
-Please pick one.
-Okay. Shall I pick one?

410
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:20,642
-Yes, please pick one.
-I'll pick one.

411
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,943
Please read it out loud.

412
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,113
"Share two strengths
you've noticed about each other."

413
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,681
It's a good one.

414
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,350
I'll go first.

415
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,253
The first strength

416
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,689
has to do with the vibe
I get from your gaze and voice.

417
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:36,358
I believe in that feeling.

418
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:37,759
You seem to be very…

419
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:40,295
good-natured

420
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:41,963
and full of love.

421
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,031
-Really?
-Yes.

422
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,533
-Can you feel that?
-Yes.

423
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,800
The second strength is…

424
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,536
-This is fun.
-You really have

425
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,806
a knack for putting other people at ease.

426
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:53,875
I'm at ease right now.

427
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:56,011
-Really?
-Those are the two strengths.

428
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,581
-How about me?
-You're…

429
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:02,784
-very smart and thorough.
-Okay.

430
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,153
You seem like a very pure person.

431
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:07,522
-Like untainted purity.
-Okay.

432
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:08,823
And I like your confidence.

433
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,659
Aha. Let's get it!

434
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,128
-Thank you.
-What's wrong with you?

435
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:16,531
It's like a spell of mine.

436
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:17,599
A spell for confidence.

437
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,301
-What do your friends say?
-Let's get it!

438
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,636
My friends? They go,
"Why is he being like that again?"

439
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,306
But I ignore them and say, "Let's get it,"

440
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,540
and it gives me confidence.

441
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,177
Now, the next card. Let's get it!

442
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,179
-Okay.
-Okay.

443
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,915
"What do the two of us have in common?"

444
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:35,016
"Let's find it."

445
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,785
We are…

446
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,553
both pure.

447
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,721
Pure. That's right.

448
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:40,922
We're innocent.

449
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:42,023
You seem very pure.

450
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,191
You also seem very pure.

451
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:44,593
You're like a newborn baby.

452
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,462
You know…

453
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:48,597
What do you mean by that?

454
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:53,535
When you look at a baby,
you can tell that they have a pure soul.

455
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,570
I get the same vibe from you.

456
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,341
You looked similar as a baby, right?

457
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,343
-You're right. I looked similar.
-Appearance-wise.

458
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,145
-You're like…
-I had the upper cheek dimples.

459
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:09,684
…a newborn.

460
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,852
You're very innocent.

461
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,120
You have an innocent soul.

462
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,929
"What do you want to learn
from the other person?"

463
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:26,101
-I'm envious of your courage.
-My courage?

464
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,069
-I'm quite a shy person.
-Okay.

465
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:29,404
You don't seem like one, though.

466
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,806
But when I see you, I think…

467
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,309
You appear gentle on the outside,

468
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:37,212
but you're actually very strong
on the inside.

469
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,649
It seems like

470
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:43,685
you do various things

471
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,720
with your own standards.

472
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:47,455
Because of that,

473
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,124
I've always found you admirable.

474
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,359
-You're a smooth talker.
-I mean…

475
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:53,361
You're a good person.

476
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:54,429
Don't say that.

477
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,331
I want to learn that from you.

478
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,435
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

479
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:05,640
If you could stop being an actor

480
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:09,944
and choose
from a wide variety of professions,

481
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:11,146
what would you choose?

482
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:12,380
-Me?
-Yes.

483
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,849
I like children,
so I'd be a kindergarten teacher.

484
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,984
It suits you very well.

485
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,153
I'd be a novelist.

486
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,555
-I can see you writing good novels.
-I do write novels.

487
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:21,956
-Really? Even now?
-Yes.

488
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:25,660
Blood type is determined by the proteins
on the surface of the red blood cells.

489
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,762
-So how can that shape one's personality?
-Exactly!

490
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,433
-Blood can't shape one's personality.
-You're right.

491
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,769
What do you value the most
in your life these days?

492
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:36,705
It's my family.

493
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:39,708
-Your family. Familial love.
-Yes.

494
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,509
-You can't live without love.
-I agree.

495
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:43,845
-Your life would be too barren.
-I agree.

496
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:45,613
-That's why people go on blind dates.
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>

497
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,450
-I agree. That's why people get married.
-<i>Five, four…</i>

498
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,584
-That's right.
-<i>…three,</i>

499
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,686
<i>two, one.</i>

500
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,521
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

501
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:56,191
"ONE-ON-ONE DATE ENDS"

502
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,494
-Now, one more date will come.
-Yes, a new date will come.

503
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,033
I'll put this away.

504
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,172
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,080
<i>Park Yongho from</i> Love Catcher In Bali

507
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:20,315
-<i>has entered.</i>
-Hello.

508
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,583
Hello.

509
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:22,684
Hello.

510
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:30,759
PARK YONGHO, LOVE CATCHER IN BALI,
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER

511
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:31,693
ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN YEEUN, ENTJ

512
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,828
-I'm Park Yongho.
-Okay.

513
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:34,963
I was born

514
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,097
in the early months of 1995.

515
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:38,800
I was born in 1995.

516
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,034
My name is Cho Yeongseok.

517
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:41,302
-Cho Yeongseok.
-Yes.

518
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,638
Shall I call you "Big brother" then?

519
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:45,607
Yes. All of my friends were born in 1994.

520
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,376
I like poems.

521
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:49,477
-He writes poems.
-Yes.

522
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,079
I enjoy writing poems.

523
