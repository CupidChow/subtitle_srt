00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:13,623
My name is Cho Yeongseok,
and I'm a pharmacist based in Seoul.

3
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,124
-You take vitamins after a meal.
-Yes.

4
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,392
How about iron supplements?

5
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,728
-Collagen supplements…
-Okay.

6
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:20,596
Taking too many supplements…

7
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,165
…you're very well-spoken.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,033
Hip-hop is my favorite genre of music.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,635
-You don't seem like the type.
-I know.

10
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,170
-I also have a rapper name.
-It's unique.

11
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,871
Firstly… Yo, Yeeun!

12
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:33,910
<i>You and I are feeling high right now</i>

13
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:35,812
<i>I want to know how you feel</i>

15
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:38,314
Skrrt!

16
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,320
"Let's spend 30 more minutes together."
Let's get it!

17
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:45,455
May I call you <i>nuna</i>?

18
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:48,458
-<i>Nuna</i>.
-Okay, Yeongseok.

19
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,394
…there are the heart line,
wisdom line, and life line.

20
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:52,662
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

21
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:54,630
You'll live a long and healthy life.

22
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:56,899
-I'm being honest. Okay.
-Be honest.

23
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,201
60 MINUTES TO LOVE

24
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:01,304
-Now, one more date will come.
-Yes, a new date will come.

25
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,605
I'll put this away.

PARK YONGHO, LOVE CATCHER IN BALI,
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,998
ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN YEEUN, ENTJ

36
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,367
What's your name? How old are you?

37
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,536
-I'm Park Yongho.
-Okay.

38
00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:35,638
I was born in the early months of 1995.

39
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:39,275
-The early months of 1995.
-You guys are the same age.

40
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:41,844
I see. He was born
in the early months of 1995.

41
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:42,912
The early months of 1995.

42
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:48,117
-How old are you?
-I was born in 1995.

43
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,252
My name is Cho Yeongseok.

44
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,353
-Cho Yeongseok.
-Yes.

45
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:51,654
-How about you?
-I was born in 1994.

46
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:54,657
"THE EARLY MONTHS OF 1995, 1994,
JUST 1995"

47
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:56,893
Shall I call you "Big brother" then?

48
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,896
Of course. I'm sure
all of his friends were born in 1994.

49
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:00,997
That's the case, but…

50
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:02,765
You were born in the early months.

51
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,400
-I see. Okay.
-You go by the school year.

52
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,969
As soon as I got here,
we sorted out seniority.

53
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,006
What do you do for a living?

54
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:12,008
I'm teaching in Incheon.

55
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:14,277
-I'm an elementary school teacher.
-Elementary schoolers.

56
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,545
Which subject do you teach?

57
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:17,680
-Elementary school teachers
-Subjects aren't divided.

58
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,115
teach all subjects.

59
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,917
What's that?

60
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,119
-Were you reading?
-It's a book of poetry.

61
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,588
"A BOOK OF POETRY"

62
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,391
"WHY DID HE BRING A BOOK OF POETRY
TO A BLIND DATE?"

63
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,993
I like poems. They're my favorite.

64
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,062
Did you bring it to read me poems?

65
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,564
There are poems I've memorized.

66
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,499
I'll recite one.

67
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,602
There's a poem titled
"Come to the Orchard in Spring."

68
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,137
"Come to the orchard in spring."

69
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,940
"There is light and wine, and sweethearts
in the pomegranate flowers."

70
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,044
"If you do not come,

71
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,745
<i>these do not matter."</i>

72
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:55,918
"Even if you do come,

73
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,954
these will still not matter."

74
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,427
There are candlelight, wine, and flowers.

75
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,996
If you don't come, the preparations
become meaningless.

76
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,098
But if you do come,

77
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,234
these things become meaningless.

78
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,236
You're the only one that matters.

79
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,204
This poem moved me.

80
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,840
I've read poems for many years,
but this one is still my favorite.

81
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:20,142
How romantic.

82
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:23,779
-He writes poems.
-Yes.

83
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,314
I like poems too.

84
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:27,750
I enjoy writing poems.

85
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,087
-Poems.
-In that case,

86
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,489
why don't I make an acrostic poem
with your initials?

87
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,659
-Really?
-Yes.

88
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:38,694
I thought of one.

89
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:41,864
J.

90
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,899
Joking aside…

91
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,102
Y.

92
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,737
Yeeun's charm is her…

93
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,739
E.

94
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,141
Elusive foot odor.

95
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,277
"JOKING ASIDE, YEEUN'S CHARM IS
HER ELUSIVE FOOT ODOR"

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,049
Get out.

97
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,519
Get out right now.

98
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,522
That's my take.

99
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,357
If you give me the initials as well…

100
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:14,797
J.

101
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:16,065
Just outside the Earth…

102
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,067
Y.

103
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,135
There is a beautiful…

104
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:22,038
E.

105
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,506
Electric galaxy.

106
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:24,607
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:27,943
It's a bit poetic.

108
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:30,179
It's poetic. It's definitely poetic.

109
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,480
-It's nice.
-Really?

110
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,918
It's so… "Just outside the Earth,
there is a beautiful electric galaxy."

111
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,254
You really seem like a teacher.

112
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,023
Let's begin right away. Let's get it.

113
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,692
-J.
-Ji Yeeun…

114
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,360
-Y.
-Y.

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,961
Is beautiful in an…

116
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,132
-E.
-E.

117
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,233
Elusive way.

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,069
"JI YEEUN IS BEAUTIFUL
IN AN ELUSIVE WAY"

119
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,122
I…

120
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:16,092
I agree.

121
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:23,999
I disagree.

122
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,134
Why?

123
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,669
Your beauty is evident, not elusive.

124
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:33,676
You're good.

125
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:36,445
He's good.

126
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,548
That must be your charm.
You're the master of flirting.

127
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,254
The older one is good.

128
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,924
-Do better.
-Of course.

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,336
-This topic is too…
-Okay.

130
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,538
Poetry isn't a popular topic.

131
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:04,607
I don't know
what you guys were talking about.

132
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:06,842
-We just talked about this and that.
-That's right.

133
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,878
-I read her palm. Shall I read yours?
-Her palm?

134
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,446
-Yes. Please read my palm.
-Let's see.

135
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,848
-How do you do it?
-Firstly…

136
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,450
And the wisdom line…

137
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:19,155
"YEONGSEOK READ YEEUN'S PALM
DURING THE ONE-ON-ONE DATE"

138
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,823
Don't try to be funny!

139
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,925
No, I…

140
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,261
-Be honest.
-I'm being honest.

141
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,962
-Be honest.
-Okay.

142
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,531
Firstly…

143
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,366
-Do you read the left hand? I don't…
-Yes.

144
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,500
-It's… What was it?
-I see.

145
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,002
-Innate traits.
-Innate traits.

146
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,770
This is the heart line.

147
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:35,838
This is the wisdom line.

148
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,740
This is the life line.

149
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,579
If you look at your wisdom line, there are

150
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,281
fine lines around it.

151
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,218
-He told me the same thing.
-I think he's confused.

152
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:53,389
-No, I didn't.
-He told me the same thing earlier.

153
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,291
You have rich emotions.

154
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,059
-I have rich emotions.
-That's right.

155
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:58,661
-It's…
-Are you a feeler?

156
00:06:58,727 --> 00:06:59,728
I'm a thinker.

157
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,665
-A thinker? I'm curious about your MBTI.
-Yes.

158
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:05,401
Is it too old-fashioned
to ask you to guess?

159
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:08,704
ENTJ.

160
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:16,946
Mine's ENTJ too.

161
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,149
I see.

162
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,955
No wonder.
It shows that you're very smart.

163
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:27,656
-Your wisdom line…
-It's the same as mine.

164
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,725
-Your life line…
-That's right. ENTJs are like that.

165
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:33,896
This is fun.

166
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:36,465
-This is fun.
-Yes.

167
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:37,633
The clouds are so pretty.

168
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,069
The clouds I can see from here
are so pretty.

169
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:49,845
-The view is so pretty.
-I know.

170
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:52,615
Just looking outside the window

171
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:55,718
brings peace to the heart.

172
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,820
-It's the power of nature.
-Yes.

173
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:03,792
Seriously.

174
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,630
<i>Fifteen minutes remain.</i>

175
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,165
Oh, my. Fifteen minutes remain.

176
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:13,335
Fifteen minutes?

177
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,804
Shall we revisit the remaining cards?

178
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,706
-Okay.
-This time, the three of us will answer.

179
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:18,841
-Okay.
-Okay.

180
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:19,909
What are those cards?

181
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:23,178
Earlier, we went through the cards
with the questions I wanted to ask.

182
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,214
I bought them at a stationery store.

183
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,849
Please pick one and read it out loud.

184
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:32,321
"Do you believe in fateful love?"

185
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:33,422
Fateful love.

186
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:35,658
Fate. I believe in fate.

187
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,393
-Fate.
-Yes.

188
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:40,362
-I believe in it.
-In what ways?

189
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,865
Two people falling in love

190
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:44,433
is…

191
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,569
very unlikely to happen.

192
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:47,636
That's right.

193
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:49,572
Don't you agree?

194
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:50,839
I agree. It's a miracle.

195
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,142
Meeting someone you love is a miracle.

196
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:56,412
When you marry someone, it's fate.

197
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:58,213
It has to be fate.

198
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,187
-How fascinating.
-It's no easy feat.

199
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,190
Falling in love with someone
is really not an easy feat.

200
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,558
It's exhausting.

201
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,060
Seriously.

202
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:14,463
That makes me pensive.

203
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:19,535
I think it's nice to make a date pensive.

204
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:21,570
I want to look at the view

205
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,172
and get lost in thoughts.

206
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,239
Same here.

207
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,810
But only 10 minutes remain.

208
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:30,379
We don't have time to be pensive.

209
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:32,982
Now…

210
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,918
We don't have time to be pensive.

211
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,022
This one is simple.
"Do you like getting flowers?"

212
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,090
I think flowers are nice.

213
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:44,026
When someone gives me flowers,
I really appreciate

214
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,228
-the thought that went into it.
-I know.

215
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:48,597
But flowers are

216
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,567
plants' reproductive organs.

217
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,005
When I read the illustrated botany books
back in the day,

218
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,775
I thought, "Why do people give each other
plants' reproductive organs?"

219
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,781
I had that thought.

220
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,917
But later on,

221
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:13,422
I came to focus on the sentimentality
of the moment.

222
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,857
-I like them a lot now.
-Right.

223
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,829
-Shall we pick the last one?
-Okay.

224
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,599
"Do you think I'll get an instant approval
or instant disapproval

225
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,834
from your parents?"

226
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,203
I eat with gusto, so I think…

227
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,973
I'll pass easily if we have a meal.

228
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,508
Hello, ma'am.

229
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:33,842
"YEONGSEOK APPEALS TO THE PARENTS"

230
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,411
Hello, ma'am.

231
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:37,613
It's nice to meet you.

232
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,781
It's nice to meet you.

233
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,683
I heard a lot about you.

234
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,689
One minute remains.

235
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,527
Talking nonstop makes me…

236
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,597
Exhausted?

237
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:57,499
I'm exhausted.

238
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:59,568
You shouldn't be saying that, right?

239
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:03,338
Really?

240
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,208
Yeongseok, leave then.

241
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,445
-No.
-Bye.

242
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,914
I'll regain my energy in no time.

243
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,451
I want to do something active like…

244
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,553
-going outside.
-Going outside.

245
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,488
Something that makes me go,
"Let's get it."

246
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,192
I want to come back here with you.

247
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:25,694
What are you saying?

248
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,233
What are you saying? That's funny.

249
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:36,338
Yongho, is there anything you want to say?

250
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,608
I want to talk to you some more
if there's time

251
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,477
and walk with you.

252
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:43,145

260
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,252
The older one is good.

261
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:26,121
-Do better.
-Of course.

262
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,258
-I'm exhausted.
-You shouldn't be saying that, right?

263
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:31,226
"PARK YONGHO SHOWED

264
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,428
-The older one sure is different.
-Seriously.

265
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:36,965
We didn't have much time.

266
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,969

plants' reproductive organs.

274
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,367
What are you saying? That's funny.

275
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,070
If we get some more time to talk,

276
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,139
let's discuss what we'll do outside

277
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,175
During the one-on-one date…

278
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,778
Why is he so funny?

279
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,382
I want to make some plans.

280
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,751
It's fine if you don't want to.

281
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:32,754
But… I didn't mean that.

282

<i>I think that was the difference.</i>

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,912
That made my heart flutter.

297
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,581

298
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:35,484
-Seriously.
-So funny.

299

-Put down your ambitions
-Okay.

306
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:07,349
and focus on the moment.

307
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,884

308
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:17,426
-The weather is nice.
-I know.

-I absolutely love taking a walk.
-Same here.

-I walk alone for three to four hours.
-Really?

312
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,101
I walk a lot too.

313
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,537
-Upon coming here…
-I thought that it'd be very hot.

314
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,973
It's hot, but the wind makes it okay.

00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,040
It isn't bad.

00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,443

When I stay seated, it's a bit…

321
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:58,200
Staying seated the whole time
was a bit hard.

322
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,802
-It's nice to walk.
-I know. Your body starts to ache.

323
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:03,171
It isn't too hot.

324
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,708
-Right? Usually, it's very hot.
-Yes. The clouds…

325
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,680
Shall we check out this place?

326
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,384
It's pretty.

327
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,485
It's pretty.

328
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,197
I love spacing out while looking at water.

329
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,600
This place is perfect for spacing out.

330
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,035
Shall I take your photos?

331
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:37,039
Don't lean on the glass. You'll fall.

332
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,374
I'm good at taking photos.

333
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:45,147
This is how it looks.

334
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:49,551
You look good on camera.

335
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:52,587
Nice. It's because I look good
in real life.

336
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:53,655
Right.

337
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:58,193
-Hold on. Make sure I look natural, okay?
-Okay.

338
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,995
Don't take photos of me.

339
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:03,231
Don't take photos of me.

340
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:05,534
<i>It's the model that makes a good photo.</i>

341
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,236
-Seriously, you're bubbly.
-Make my back look amazing.

342
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,342
I rarely look good on camera.

343
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,944
You look much prettier in real life.

344
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,214
It'd be nice to sit outside
when the weather is nice.

345
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,282
I know.

346
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,019

349
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,057
You wanted to come outside.

350
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,427
-It's hot.
-Yes.

00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,766
"THEY RETURN AFTER ONLY 10 MINUTES"

352
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,469

-It's pretty.

353
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,437
I got to take a look around,
so I'm satisfied.

354
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:43,505
Right.

355
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:46,441
I enjoy coming to a place like this
with my family.

356
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,277
So this place brought back an old memory.

357
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:53,048
I suddenly became curious about
what kind of a student you were.

358
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,616
I was very quiet.

359
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,053
I was very introverted.

360
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,921
The thing is,

361
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:03,358
-you have different facets.
-Yes.

362
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:06,528
I don't think all of them
can be captured on TV.

363
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,697
Of course not.
TV just captures my funny side

364
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:10,098
-for variety shows.
-Right.

365
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:12,767
That's the only side that gets broadcast,

366
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,870
so people don't know everything about me.

367
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:15,937
Right.

368
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,007
-You don't know me either.
-I don't know you very well.

369
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,376
So teach me.

370
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:26,414
Little by little.

371
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,618
-Okay.
-Actually, I need time.

372
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:32,420
Actually, it takes me a while to open up.

373
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,956
Same here. It takes me a while to open up.

374
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:37,959
-But I feel comfortable around you.
-Right.

375
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:41,129
I want to ask you this.

376
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,333
Let's say you go on an actual date

377
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,401
with someone.

378
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,803
What would you like to do?

379
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,706
Do you want to be a love interest?

380
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:52,807
Yes.

381
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:56,745
So…

382
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:57,812
Okay.

383
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,549
A bowling alley, video arcade…

384
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,450
Those were the places I thought of.

385
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,954
When I walk around these days,

386
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,123
I see huge claw machine arcades.

387
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,092
It'll be nice to go there
and try to win prizes.

388
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,595
-I want to go to karaoke.
-That was one of the ideas.

389
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:14,930
Do you enjoy going to karaoke?

390
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:17,832
-Yes, I go alone.
-But I don't want to go there with you.

391
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:20,735
-Why not? Since I'll sing hip-hop songs?
-I think you'll only rap.

392
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:21,803
You're right.

393
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,471
Let's get it!

394
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,006
<i>MC Zerostone in the building</i>

395
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,411
Talking fast doesn't make you a rapper.

396
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,816
I want to hear you sing properly.

397
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,651
-I'll do it at karaoke.
-Okay.

398
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,087
I want to hear you sing

399
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:43,158
a melodious song with emotions.

400
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,460
Haven't you listened to my song?

401
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,628
<i>Milk Shake</i>?

402
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:48,597
-Have you released a song?
-Yes, I have.

403
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:50,966
I see.

404
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,002
-<i>Milk Shake</i>.
-Yes.

405
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,137
How does the rhythm go?

406
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:58,106
<i>Milkshake, milk, milk</i>

407
00:19:58,173 --> 00:19:59,274
What are you doing?

408
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:03,612
-Are you moving to the rhythm?
-Yes.

409
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,083
-Is <i>Milk Shake</i> available at karaokes?
-I think so.

410
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:09,818
Then let's go to karaoke no matter what.

411
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:11,319
That sounds good.

412
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,155
After the blind date,

413
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:17,459
do you go, "I was on a blind date
with Ji Yeeun?"

414
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,427
No, I don't say that.

415
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:20,962
Do it.

416
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,735
-What should I say?
-Promote the show.

417
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:29,604
Really? Then my friends will go, "Really?"

418
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,805
"What's Ji Yeeun like?"

419
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,044
"She's the same as she appears on TV."

420
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,179
"She might be a bit prettier
than she appears on TV."

421
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:40,181
I'm prettier in real life.

422
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:44,419
I'm not the same as I appear on TV.

423
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,290
But appearance isn't everything.

424
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,394
Even though we've just met,

425
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,863
you make me feel at ease.

426
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:00,035
And you've welcomed me
with a bright smile.

427
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,272
You've been a very good influence on me.

428
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:06,041
-That's nice.
-Thank you.

429
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:08,043
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>
-I feel the same.

430
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,111
-<i>Five, four,</i>
-I feel the same. Thank you for this.

431
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:11,646
-<i>three, two,</i>
-The supplements.

432
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,315
-<i>one.</i>
-Okay.

433
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:15,150
-<i>The blind date has ended.</i>
-Take them at home.

434
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:16,284
"ONE-ON-ONE DATE ENDS"

435
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,020
-My new date is here.
-Here he comes.

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,928

-You applied for this.
-Yes.

442
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,170
I see.
