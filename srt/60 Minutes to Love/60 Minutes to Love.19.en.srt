30-MINUTE VIDEO ARCADE

PARK CHANGSUN'S
30-MINUTE KARAOKE DATE

WHO WILL GO ON
A ONE-ON-ONE DATE?

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,223
Yeeun, you must now choose one
of the two romantic interests.

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,259
Gentlemen, please go into
your respective room

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,827
and stand by.

10
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,003
I'm in trouble.

11
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,517
"CHO YEONGSEOK'S ROOM,
PARK CHANGSUN'S ROOM"

12
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,760
<i>I prepared a date that Yeeun would like.</i>

13
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,163
<i>She enjoyed my terrible singing.</i>

14
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,534
<i>I prepared the date in hopes</i>
<i>of moving her heart.</i>

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,836
Pink hydrangea symbolizes
a fluttering heart.

16
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,137
Hold on.

17
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,374
It can be unsafe for the wrist.

18
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,646
"SWEETNESS PERSONIFIED,
PARK CHANGSUN"

19
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,149
I brought a present as well.

20
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,851
I don't want you to get exhausted.

21
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,419
-So… Yes.
-It's an energy drink.

22
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,922
<i>Since it was hot,</i>

23
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>I thought about what we could do</i>
<i>to have an active date indoors.</i>

24
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,062
Yeeun is cute, so…

25
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,432
<i>I wanted to record the day with photos.</i>

26
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,369
"THE MAN WHO PUTS YOU AT EASE
LIKE A FRIEND, CHO YEONGSEOK"

27
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,604
It'd be a shame to part ways now.

28
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,712
Yeeun, please open the door
and enter the room of the man

29
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,815

a one-on-one date with.

30
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,954
Please choose in three seconds.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,021
Three…

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,490
In three seconds?

33
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,758
-That's insane.
-Two…

34
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,562
one. Please choose one.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,567
Hello.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,371
WHICH ROMANTIC INTEREST
WILL GO ON

37
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,639
A ONE-ON-ONE DATE WITH YEEUN?

38
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,474
Hello.

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,677
"YEEUN CHOSE PARK CHANGSUN"

40
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,579
-Really?
-Yes.

41
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,947
Hold on.

42
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,993
Cho Yeongseok is out.

43
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,060
Okay.

44
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,295
"CHO YEONGSEOK IS OUT"

45
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,631
-Thank your terrible singing.
-Really?

46
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,799
-Thank goodness.
-Yes.

47
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,035
The karaoke date was more fun.

48
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,103
Here you go.

49
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,206
-The karaoke date was more fun.
-I'm glad it was fun.

50
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,407
I prepared something more fun

51
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,742
-for the second date.
-Really?

52
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,310
Let's go.

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,012
This is…

54
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,517
The karaoke date was more fun.

55
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,052
He wasn't a talented singer,

56
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,255
but the way he poured his heart
into singing

57
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,523
looked adorable.

58
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,625
He was more to my liking.

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,529
You failed to impress Yeeun
with your date today.

60
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,598
Why do you think you failed?

61
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,001
I think

62
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:25,271
Changsun confessing his love
on his knees was too impactful.

63
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:30,243
-Please say your last words to Yeeun.
-Okay.

64
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,748
Thank you for giving me good memories.

65
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,884
I'll always root for you.

66
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,652
And Changsun, good luck.

75
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,946
-This is…
-It's cool in here.

76
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,014
It's cool.

77
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,315
"THEY MOVE TO THE NEXT LOCATION"

78
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,950
You're exhausted, right?

79
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,785
Still,

80
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,287
I'm doing okay.

81
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,190
-Karaoke…
-You had ice cream at karaoke.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,458
I wasn't exhausted at karaoke.

83
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,293
I'm glad to hear that.

84
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,002
I didn't think you'd choose me.

85
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,403
Really?

86
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,374
When I got on my knees, I thought,
"Maybe this was a bad idea."

87
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,978
Then the wrap came off.
I was like, "What's going on?"

88
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,546
-Hello.
-Oh, goodness.

89
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,216
Oh, geez. Please don't do this.

90
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,386
Women hate this the most.

91
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,453
-Take it.
-Thank you.

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,555
-Thank you.
-I thought the vibe was too depressing.

93
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,691
-It came apart.
-Oh, no.

94
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,892
"FLUSTERED BECAUSE
THE WRAP CAME OFF"

95
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,461
-It's wet.
-It's wet.

96
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,864
That made me go,

97
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,133
"This must be the end for me."

98
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,734
I waited with that thought.

99
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,006
I practiced so hard
to sing "Milk Shake" at karaoke.

100
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,809
-But I couldn't sing well.
-I could tell you were trying hard,

101
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,178
but you were out of tune.

102
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,718
But you seemed to find it funny,

103
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,153
so I tried harder.

104
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,159
Where are we going?

105
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,261
For the second date…

106
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,699
When I first had
a one-on-one conversation with you,

107
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,770
-I took notes of what you like.
-Okay.

108
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,439
-…what you like.
-Okay.

109
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,709
So, I prepared a date you'd like.

110
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,243
What is it?

111
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,813
Tteokbokki.

112
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,214
Will we eat tteokbokki?

113
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,652
I prepared a date Yeeun would like.

114
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,921
What kind of food do you like?

115
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,156
-Spicy food? Really?
-I like spicy food.

116
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,559
"YEEUN'S FAVORITE FOOD,
SPICY TTEOKBOKKI"

117
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,793
Spicy tteokbokki.

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,095
If we make it together,

119
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,198
we'll become closer.

120
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,901
I prepared a cooking date.

121
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,871
We'll make tteokbokki. Yes.

122
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,575
At a cooking studio,

123
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,378
I'll make tteokbokki for you.

124
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,313
That sounds good.

125
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,848
Busan-style tteokbokki.

126
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,484
Busan-style tteokbokki.
I love that. Busan-style.

127
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,487
I went to a grandma in Busan who makes

128
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,857
-very spicy and tasty tteokbokki.
-I love spicy food.

129
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,291
-Did you get her recipe?
-I went

130
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,727
and learned her recipe.

131
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,098
-Please make it her way.
-Okay, I'll recreate it.

132
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,833
Seriously. Please recreate her recipe.

133
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,869
I'll use the golden ratio.

134
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,936
Okay.

135
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,245
All right.

136
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,880

137
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,048
-All right.
-So, this is the place.

00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,217

00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,135
-Yes. From Busan,
-Really?

146
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,272
I brought fish cakes
and other ingredients.

00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,711
I can't wait to eat. I'm hungry.

150
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,780
Please wait.

151
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,948
This is incredible!

152
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,450
Fish cakes from Busan.

153
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,185
This is incredible.

154
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,390
He said he'd make my favorite food,
tteokbokki, so I got really excited.

155
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,993
He even brought the ingredients
all the way from Busan.

156
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,362
I was so grateful.

157
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,264

-So, let's hurry. Yes.
-Shall we hurry?

165
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,565

-This much?
-I think I can eat more.

173
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,325

00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,565
-Please keep the pieces big…

-Okay.

00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,234
How much time…

178
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,636
-Big.
-Yes.

179
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,539
-About two-finger lengths.
-Okay.

180
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,246
Here. Have some.

181
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:09,916
There's one more.

182
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:10,983
"AN EGG FOR HUNGRY YEEUN"

183
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,391
You must be very hungry.

184
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,326
Yes.

185
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,330
It's tasty.

186
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,800
All right. This is gochugaru.

187
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,236
You need to add a lot of gochugaru.

188
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,071
-Oh, you put in a lot.
-Yes.

189
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,073
This is regular gochugaru.

190
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,141
"CHEONGYANG GOCHUGARU"

191
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,010
Oh, my.

192
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,079
-They're different.
-I'll take this

193
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,348
and add a bit

194
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,183
to the bowl.

195
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,851
Is it spicy?

196
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,019
It's spicy.

197
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,488
You need a lot of oligosaccharide syrup.

198
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,357
Add an excessive amount.

199
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,192
Take this and…

200
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,830
-You can see it, right?
-Yes.

201
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,366
Smell it.

202
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,002
It smells good.

203
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,203
I can't wait to eat.

204
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,073
It's nearly done.

205
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,542
<i>Ten minutes have passed.</i>

206
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,079
The water isn't even boiling yet.

207
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,548
This is bad.

208
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,317
"BEGINS COOKING"

209
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,988
It smells really good.

210
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,090
I can't smell anything yet.

211
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
No?

212
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,028
Cheongyang gochugaru

213
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,297
adds a kick.

214
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,365
Cheongyang gochugaru?

215
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,432
I'll buy it.

216
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,668
The flavor of green onions

217
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,803
is what makes tteokbokki tasty.

218
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,906
Yes. Green onions are essential.
The more you add, the tastier it gets.

219
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,110
I should make this at home.
It's very simple.

220
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,812
Hurry up and boil.

221
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,650
-Until it boils, I'll…
-Okay.

222
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,953
make one more thing.

223
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,254
Like what?

224
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,256
Something we can drink with the food.

225
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,324
A beverage.

226
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,763
I came really prepared, right?

227
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,198
Could it be…

228
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,701
a milkshake?

229
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,671
I'll make a milkshake.

230
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,206
All right.

231
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,208
-You did prepare a lot.
-Yes.

232
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,977
If I'd gotten eliminated,

233
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,046
I would've had to take
everything back home.

234
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,152
-Are you making a strawberry milkshake?
-Yes.

235
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,420
I prepared a different flavor.

236
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,088
I like strawberry.

237
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,960
Since I'm making two servings,
I'll add a lot.

238
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,396
Now…

239
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,801
You're using Jersey milk today as well.

240
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,371
-I brought everything you like.
-Okay.

241
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,007
I didn't expect I'd be so tight on time.

242
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,711
Thirty minutes seems like a lot of time,
but it actually isn't.

243
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,581
Then I'll add 10 minutes to the date.

244
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,682
Thank you.

245
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,517
Thank you.

246
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,723
I knew we'd have no choice

247
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,925
but to add extra time.

248
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,499
The milkshake is ready.

249
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,670
<i>Since Yeeun has added</i>
<i>10 minutes to the date,</i>

250
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,206
<i>twenty minutes remain.</i>

251
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,508
It'll be a success if this is very tasty.

252
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,544
I'm really looking forward to it.

253
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,446
When are we adding ramyeon noodles?

254
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,581
-What?
-Ramyeon noodles.

255
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,382
Ramyeon…

256
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,652
Just add all of it.

257
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,022
I like rabokki.

258
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,190
-Me too.
-Yes.

259
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,425
When I go to a snack bar…

260
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,593
I always order rabokki.

261
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,562
I always order tonkatsu and rabokki.

262
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,364
Is tonkatsu your comfort food?

263
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,200
Or spicy stir-fried pork?

264
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,301
It's pork gukbap.

265
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,704
For Busan natives, pork gukbap is

266
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,305
-the comfort food.
-I like it too.

267
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,008
-It looks tasty, right?
-Yes.

268
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,180
Do you prefer your noodles
fully cooked or…

269
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,348
I prefer them firm.

270
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,415
-Firm?
-Yes.

271
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,884
They're only a bit soft right now.

272
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,951
-Really?
-They're perfect.

273
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,219
Let's go.

274
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,088
-Good work.
-Good work.

275
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,222
All right.

276
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,761
It looks tasty.

277
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,031
I get really hungry around this time.

278
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,634
-This was a good plan, right?
-Yes.

279
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,968
Just when you're hungry…

280
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,239
It looks so good.

281
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,541
-It really does.
-Yes.

282
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,109
-Good work on cooking.
-Thank you.

283
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,579
And there's milkshake. On the cups…

284
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,647
Okay.

285
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,783
-I put messages for you.
-What is it?

286
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,518
I thought about writing a letter,

287
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,720
but it seemed a bit excessive. So…

288
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,590
I kept it short. The first message is,

289
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,160
"Prioritize the health
of your body and mind."

290
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,729
-That's nice.
-And there's…

291
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,300
"Protect your cheerfulness
and brightness."

292
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,734
These are the messages.

293
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,236
-Thank you.
-No worries.

294
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,737
"PROTECT YOUR CHEERFULNESS
AND BRIGHTNESS"

295
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,105
To this…

296
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,274
It's looking good.

297
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,746
Gosh, that startled me.

298
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,283
-Hold on.
-Thank you.

299
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,352
-Is there some for you?
-Yes.

300
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,724
Take some of mine.

301
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,992
-Take some of mine.
-Thank you.

302
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,193
Give me just a bit.

303
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,529
Thank you.

304
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,198
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

305
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,800
-Try it. It's time to taste it.
-Okay.

306
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,502
We don't want the noodles to get soggy.

307
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,904
-Take some.
-Okay.

308
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,239
-Take some with your fork.
-Okay.

309
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,841
This is insane.

310
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,078
It's not so soupy.

311
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,747
"NERVOUS"

312
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,215
I'll try it.

313
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,221
It's tasty.

314
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,224
-It's tasty.
-Is it tasty?

315
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,561
-Thank goodness.
-It's really spicy.

316
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,762
-It's spicy, right?
-Yes.

317
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,797
I like that it's spicy.

318
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,236
I made it so that it'd suit your taste.

319
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,608
It's tasty.

320
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,613
Seriously.

321
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,718
Seriously.

322
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,287
It's so good.

323
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,756
It's really tasty.

324
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,164
I feel proud that you like it.

325
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,134
Seriously, it tastes incredible.

326
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,670
I wrote down the recipe.

327
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,674
I'll give it to you if you choose me.

328
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,877
Actually, no.

329
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,679
I'll make it for you if you choose me.

330
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,846
Really?

331
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,249
-Seriously.
-Yes.

332
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,687
-Seriously.
-Yes.

333
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,027
It's seriously tasty. I mean it.

334
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,163
Try it.

335
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,998
-Is that tasty too?
-Yes, it's so good.

336
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,971
It's so tasty.

337
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,038
-It's tasty, right?
-Yes.

338
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,180
Come to think of it,
this will be our last date.

339
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,715
-Yes.
-Hold on.

340
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,785
What do you want to do the most
with the final romantic interest?

341
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,021
I want to do something small.

342
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,522
-Something small?
-Yes.

343
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,658
Karaoke?

344
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,893
Karaoke would be nice.

345
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,261
We could eat something tasty.

346
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,500
If I become the final romantic interest,

347
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,969
I'll keep going to karaoke to practice.

348
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,643
-You know, it's fascinating.
-What is?

349
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,412
-We've met three times.
-Yes.

350
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,314
At first,

351
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,017
I was so incredibly nervous.

352
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,187
-I'm nervous.
-Really?

353
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,255
Yes.

354
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,290
Really?

355
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,525
There's no need to be nervous.

356
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,593
-Is that so?
-Yes.

357
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,660
Okay.

358
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,331
Now, I feel comfortable enough to eat.

359
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,500

-Now?

366
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,120
-<i>…please answer.</i>
-But we still have two minutes.

367

But seriously…

373
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,701
For real,

374
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,370
time passed quickly.

375
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,805
Was it the most fun date?

376
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,674
Seriously, it was fun.

377
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,215
I know that the choice is yours,

378
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,285
so I focused on doing my best.

379
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,421
All right. In any case,

380
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,490

-That's right.

381

-I'm full.
-Yes.

383
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,362
I'm very satisfied with the date.

384
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,931
It was the best.

385
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,168
And don't forget these messages.

386
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,172
"Protect your cheerfulness
and brightness."

387
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,641
I put a lot of thought
into these messages.

388
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,843
Really?

389
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,478
Thank you.

390
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,379
Let's clink our glasses one last time.

-Gosh, it has ended.
-I know.

394
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,262
I know.

395
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,167
Hold on.

396
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,469
The date should be extended.
She ate some more.

397
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,606
-No.
-She cheated.

398
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,712
He always puts
a lot of thought into the date.

399
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,514
I'm talking about the cups

400
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,882

401
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,417
It was fun. Time passed very quickly.

402

406
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,197
-Wouldn't it be a shame?
-It'd be a shame.

407
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,365
This is fun.

408
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,300
It's so much fun. I don't want to leave.

409
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,636
