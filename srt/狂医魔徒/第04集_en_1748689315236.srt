00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,156
Hello, Dr. Jeong.

5
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,117
Yes.

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,160
Sure.

7
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,039
Is it possible for you to switch shifts
with Dr. Jeong today?

8
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,750
I don't really know why,
but she can't make it in to work.

9
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,419
Yes.

10
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,045
Thanks.

11
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,132
-Everything okay?
-Oh, you're in early.

12
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,217
-What's wrong with Seok?
-[sighs]

13
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,678
She called and said
she can't come in to work today.

14
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,681
-The bypass surgery is today.
-I know.

15
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,309
Could she be sick?

16
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,811
She sounded okay on the phone.

[Seguk] <i>It's obvious, isn't it?</i>

18
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,191
<i>I bet she just ditched work</i>
<i>'cause she's burned out.</i>

19
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,611
Honestly, can you think of another reason
why she would miss a bypass surgery?

20
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,697
-She's obsessed with surgery.
-Hey.

21
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,287

23
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,297
She went home.

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,218
She told me
she needed to pick up some winter clothes.

25
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,804

[Uyeong] Seok rents this house
from a grandma she's close with.

32
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,726

00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,856
I just wish it was closer to the hospital.

-She has family?
-What?

00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,070
Oh…

38
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,573
She's not related to her.
They're just close.

39
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,534
Just an old lady she's close to?

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
Yeah.

41
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,586
There was only enough for one coffee.

42
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,005
So what happened then?

43
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,215
Your face looks terrible.

44
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,383
How observant of you.

45
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,968
Drink up.

46
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,637
I'm fine.

47
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,890
You can have it.

48
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,893
Well, I'm fine too.

49
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,895
Oh, no thank you.

50
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,355
What's wrong?

[Dr. Choi sighs]

52
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,531
All right, fine.

53
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,575
-Uyeong.
-[chokes]

54
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,411
-Yes.
-Go out and get her some meds.

[clears throat]

56
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707

What's with all those books in the yard?

60
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,645
It's stuff I don't need anymore.

61
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,480
So I'm getting rid of it.

62
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,152
These days doctors tend to specialize
in a particular field,

63
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,696
like vascular surgery or tumor removal.

64
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,450
They'll even focus on a subtype of surgery
within that field.

65
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,369
So what?

66
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,830
I mean, some doctors also
only perform TSA procedures,

67
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,457
while others spend their whole entire day
coiling aneurysms

68
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,334
and then calling it their speciality.

69
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,338
I want to learn everything, do everything.

70
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,550
So I can be just like you.

71
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,761
Yes, I do it all.

72
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,431
Why'd you miss work today?

73
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,811
I would appreciate it
if you wouldn't lie to me.

74
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,189
[scoffs] I wasn't going to
in the first place.

75
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,902
[sighs]

76
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,951
Here's the proof.

77
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,203
It's right here.

78
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,624
-What?
-We're the same,

79
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,709
you and I.

80
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,050
We're the same how?

81
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,722
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying I can see right through you.

82
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,058
Once again, don't lie to me.

83
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,227
I'll know if you do.

84
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,980
[scoffs]

85
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,482
What possible reason would I have
to lie to you?

86
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,906
Why are you really doing this, huh?

87
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,367
So I skipped out on one day of work.

88
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,412
I already told you
I slipped on ice on the way here.

89

90
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,171

You son of a bitch. Get back here now.

95
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,818
You brought Dr. Choi here
to screw me over, didn't you?

<i>you're doing this to me.</i>

00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,829
Get back here. Hurry back
and get him out of my house right now.

99
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
After the pharmacy run.

100
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,957
<i>Forget the pharmacy!</i>

101
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,211
Just turn the damn car around already
and tell him it was closed!

102
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,590
Okay, fine. You win.

Who is this guy? Why is he here?

I've never seen him before in my life.

106
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,549
That's the truth.

107
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,938
[stammers] I opened the door,
and he followed me in.

Well, then…

What are you going to do now?

120
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,164
I'll bury him

I'll call you.

182
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,876
Do you feel all superior or something?

183
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,794
Like you're some big shot now?

184
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,171
That what this is about?

185
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,257
You think I'm a psychopath, huh?

186
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,926
I'm just saying it's interesting.
I know you think so too.

187
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,470
No, I really don't.

188
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,513
I don't find this interesting. It's scary!

189
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,515
You should be scared, too!

190
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,311
Everything we buried.
It's all completely burned, right?

191
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,772
You were the last one to check it,
weren't you?

192
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,661
What's Dr. Choi doing here?

193
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,806
Ah, man. Those bastards.

194
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,557
They made sure to torch everything.

195
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,937
Kim, give me some gloves.

196
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,164
[Dr. Choi] Mannitol.

197
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,209
It removes excess water from the body.

198
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,419
A neurological drug?

199
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,507
It's prescribed to reduce eye pressure
or treat renal failure.

200
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,551
It's used in my department too.

201
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,262
For neurosurgery?

202
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,605
Mmm…

203
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh, no. What are you thinking?

204
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,779
You stay right here.

205
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,788
[chattering]

206
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,356
[radio dialing]

207
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,649
[officer] <i>Search Team 3 here.</i>

208
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,693
<i>We found the victim's belongings.</i>
<i>It's her purse.</i>

209
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,238
-Can you confirm it's the victim’s?
-<i>We found her ID card in the wallet.</i>

210
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,949
<i>We'll send it over</i>
<i>to headquarters immediately. Over.</i>

211
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,744
What did they find?

212
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,078
-[phone ringing]
-Mmm.

213
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,497
The victim's purse.

214
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,792
Yeah, Lee. Go ahead.

215
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,045
[Wanil] <i>You're with Dr. Choi, right?</i>

216
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,504
-Yeah, why?
-Um…

217
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,217
<i>One of his students is waiting for him</i>
<i>outside. Could you please let him know?</i>

218
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,010
-Yeah, all right.
-[line clicks]

219
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,887
He must be here with my laptop.

220
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,604
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

221
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,939
I know you're busy.

222
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,524
I had the rest of your things
sent to your house.

223
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,609
Good, thank you.

224
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,153
How long are you staying here?

225
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,156
[sighs] Well, we'll see.

226
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,991
[Wanil] Dr. Choi!

227
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,090
Why is he being such a good boy today?

228
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,968
He usually doesn't let anyone touch him
except for his partner.

229
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,052
Do you like me?

230
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,179
'Cause I like you!

231
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,349
[Wanil chuckles] Your student seems
to be something of a dog expert.

232
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,727
She owns dogs. She has quite a few.

233
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,895
[Wanil] Makes sense.

234
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,272
What kinds of dogs?

235
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,815
Rottweilers.

236
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,400
[Wanil] Rottweilers?

237
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,859
Aren't they really aggressive?

238
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,238
They're absolute sweethearts.

239
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,575
Uyeong Ha. Hey.

240
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,160
[stammers] Hey.

241
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,998
[sighs]

242
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,462
[Seok] What exactly are you doing here?

243
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,757
[Dr. Choi] What about you?
You shouldn't be here.

244
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,510
This is about the award, huh?

245
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,679
Because I took it from you?

246
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,057
You must be out of your mind.

247
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,393
What were you thinking
showing your face here?

248
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,812
It is, isn't it?

249
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,148
You're suddenly hanging out
with the cops now?

250
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,774
'Cause of your precious award.

251
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,776
You're pissed off.

252
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,362
Do you have any idea where the hell
you are right now?

253
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,240
There's only so much madness
I'm willing to overlook.

254
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,661
You think scaring me
into performing your surgery will work?

255
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,079
Not a chance.

256
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,290
Going around killing people,
you're pathetic!

257
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh, I'm the pathetic one?

258
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,669
Myeongjin Kim.

259
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,631
-You're a murderer too.
-How dare you say that?

260
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,841
We are nothing alike!

261
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,301
We absolutely are.

262
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm glad you had my pharmacy closed

263
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,478
because now I have all the time
in the world.

264
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,355
Do what you want.

265
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,149
You can keep trying to put the pressure
on me.

266
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm gonna find Myeongjin Kim
no matter what it takes.

267
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,529
When I find his body,

268
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,782
I'll give you a call.

269
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,458
[sighs]

270
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,685
[Dr. Choi sighs]

271
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,189
That's the girl who was messing with you
before, isn't it?

272
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,110
What the hell is she doing here?

273
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,861
Who knows?

274
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,864
She gets pissed off
by the mere thought of me.

275
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,742
Has she forgotten what she did to you?
[chuckles]

276
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,412
[chuckles]

277
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,457
-What is it?
-Ah, no. Nothing.

278
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,060
[Dr. Choi] <i>We are nothing alike!</i>

279
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,440
Hey, do you remember Eunsim Han?

280
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,859
She was in our class.

281
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,819
Uh… Eunsim Han?

282
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,030
[Myeongjin] She was the girl
who got married in a rush.

283
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,492
All of us went to her wedding
even though it was really short notice.

284
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:48,080
[chuckles] We even did a collection so she
could have some cash as a wedding gift.

285
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,165
Remember?

286
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,794
Man, those were the days, huh? [chuckles]

287
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,882
[person] Hi. How are you?

288
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,843
YONGHYEON CATHOLIC CHURCH

289
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,679
[Dr. Han] Hmm… You've been
having heartburn, is that right?

290
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,306
-[patient] Yeah.
-I see.

291
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,476
Well, in that case, you should come
by the clinic so we can run some tests.

292
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,103
-You know where it is?
-Of course. Thank you, Doctor.

293
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,023
Why would you help him?
You've got your own problems to deal with.

294
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,525
His father is dead.
I feel bad for the guy.

295
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,111
You don't know he's dead.
I thought he ran away.

296
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,114
Well, I know he was killed by Dr. Choi.

297
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,117
[sighs] That doesn't make any sense.

298
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,996
Why would Dr. Choi want to kill anyone?
Not everyone is like you.

299
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,791
All humans are evil.

300
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,375
That's just the way it is, you know.

301
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,127
Will you stop already?

302
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,172
Oh. He's here.

303
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,510
Well, best of luck helping him then.

304
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,844
I'm going to stay here.

305
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,012
And do what?

306
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,224
Hope that you snap out of this
and then come to your senses!

307
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,226
What's with you?

308
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,823
[reporter] <i>These are shots</i>

What does it look like to you?

323
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,379
[Wanil] Well,

324
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,590
when can we expect to get the results?

325
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,633
It's not like I'm just sitting around.

326
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,344

So you went out for drinks last night

-Well, just a beer.

-It's Sojeong.

334
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,844
I've been too easy to reach lately,
so now I'm playing hard to get.

335

Young or old, women are all the same,
you know?

336
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,309
Hmm? A bit of neglect. They like that.

-Hello.
-Ah, Detective Lee.

-Wanil, you made it.
-Yeah.

340
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,950
-Have a drink.
-Oh. Thanks.

341
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,668
[grunts] Wanil, ya little shit.

342
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,087
How did it go at the NFS?

343
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,713
Ah. Check this out.

344
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,008
Oh, not now, not now. Do it later.

345
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,971
Can I please take a look?

346
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,223
[chuckles] Of course you can. Please do.

347
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:35,975

But they'll let us know for sure
once they get the lab results in.

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,465
[Yang] You should've told her
to expedite our case.

355
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,509
[Wanil] I did.
But she really snapped at me.

356
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,092
DONGHAE JEIL MENTAL HOSPITAL

357
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
DANGER - NO ENTRY

358
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,859
See you later. Okay, thanks. Bye.

359
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,363
Hello there.

360
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,324
He's the one who called you yesterday.

361
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,492
-Ah…
-Hello.

362
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,244
I sent that email to you a while ago.

363
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,664
I have no clue when that was.
But I never heard back.

364
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,666
So I thought he was found.

365
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,668
Come on then.

366
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,437
I never threw this away,

367
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,814
just in case.

368
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,651
He was in Room 401 in the locked ward,

369
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,861
and his name was

370
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,488
Seokgu Lee.

371
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,824
Myeongjin Kim wasn't his name?

372
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,075
Mm-mmm.

373
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,244
Well, I don't know
why his name's different.

374
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,746
But what I do know is that's him.

375
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,039
It's definitely him.

376
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
You have any photos?

377
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,962
Why would I go around taking pictures
of patients? That'd be weird.

378
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,049
Then how do we know
this Seokgu Lee is really his dad?

379
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,176
What actual proof is there?

380
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,261
[handyman sighs]

381
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,513
Because I told you it's him.
[clicks tongue]

382
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,348
So,

383
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,100
um…

384
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,477
This patient named Seokgu Lee,

385
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,562
where is he now?

386
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,982
How should I know where all the patients
went after the hospital was shut down?

387
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,824
Your father has a scar on his head.

388
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,743
You didn't write that on your flyer.

389
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,787
So how would I even know that?

390
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,165
[hair clippers buzzing]

391
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,468
It looked something like this.

392
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,054
Yeah?

393
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,139
Here.

394
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,900
Can we take a look inside of the hospital?

395
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,068
ENTERING WITHOUT PERMISSION
IS A VIOLATION

396
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,365
CEASE AND DESIST ORDER

397
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,552
[handyman groans]

398
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,765
So, the reward you mentioned,

399
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,269
when will I get it?
After you find your father or what?

400
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,814
As soon as we get actual confirmation that
he was here,

401
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,775
I'll give it to you.

402
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,653
Fair enough.

403
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,840
[handyman] Okay. This is it.
Let's see now. Wait a minute.

404
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,843
-Hang on. Uh…
-[keys jingling]

405
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,345
Which one is it again?

406
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,766
No, not this one. Uh… Maybe this one?

407
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,935
No, probably not.

408
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,397
Wait, is it?

409
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,774
Which one is it? What do we have here?

410
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,942
[jingling continues]

411
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,403
Are you doing all right?

412
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,532
[stammers]

413
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,742
I need the restroom. Excuse me.

414
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,123
[handyman] Not this one. Ah! Here it is.

415
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,167
[Kiyoung breathing heavily]

416
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,511
So this Seokgu Lee,

417
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,596
did he have a visitor or what?

418
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,682
Huh?

419
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,935
I'm asking if anyone came
to visit him or not.

420
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,273
A visitor? Someone came. I saw him once.

421
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,649
[drill whirring]

422
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,738
<i>It was this gray-haired guy.</i>

423
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,366
<i>He showed up and took him for a stroll</i>
<i>in a wheelchair,</i>

424
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,451
<i>somewhere around here.</i>

425
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,953
Really?

426
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,206
Hang on a minute. Just a sec.

427
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,878
Hmm.

428
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,046
Is this the guy?

429
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,298
CHOI DEOKHEE - NEUROSURGEON
DRAWS WORLD'S ATTENTION

430
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,556
Do you want me to keep watching her?

431
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,266
No, leave her alone for now.

432
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,269
If she's going to learn,
she must do it on her own.

433
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,439
She believes
the two of us are exactly alike.

434
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,941
But that's all it is. Simply a belief.

435
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,068
A misguided one.

436
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,403
But the truth is you two are alike.

437
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,405
That's what I think at least.

438
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,159
We are alike in a lot of ways. I get it.

439
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,911
However, if you look closely,

440
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,121
we're different.

441
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,589
[Seok sighs]

442
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,178
Hmm?

443
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,971
Here it is. Seokgu Lee.

444
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,604
Geez.

445
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,191
What's with these
ridiculous prescriptions? [chuckling]

446
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,528
Did they really give him
all these medications at once?

447
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,323
Look, if that's what it says,
then I guess so.

448
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,200
[scoffs]

449
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,077
That's great.

450
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,705
All these crazy people are gonna be
the end of us, ya know.

451
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,167
But look. Regardless,

452
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,712
we still don't know if Seokgu Lee
and Myeongjin Kim are the same individual.

453
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,090
-You have nothing else?
-Aw, geez. [scoffs]

454
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,008
Shouldn't figuring that out be your job?

455
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,594
What?

456
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,639
You two can piece together
the rest on your own.

457
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,100
[sighs]

458
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,437
My father was never here.

459
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,606
You're just messing with us, aren't you?

460
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,984
You punk,
what the fuck do you take me for?

461
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,485
You're wasting our time.

462
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,072
You little shits. I can't believe this.

463
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,200
You got a problem with me or something?
Proof, huh?

464
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,870
[scoffs] Yeah, is that
what you fucking want? Hmm?

465
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,580
I'll prove it to you bastards right now!

466
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,831

470
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,799
Hi, hey. It's me.

471
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,884
Listen. Um…

472
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,720
-Where are you?
-<i>Oh, I'm on a hike.</i>

473
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,472
<i>I'm having some makgeolli</i>
<i>before I come down. What's up?</i>

474
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:58,018
That one time those press people came
to do a story…

475
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,938
We took a picture with the patients
in the lounge in Ward Two.

476
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,607
You remember that, don't you?

477
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,901
<i>Yeah, what about it?</i>

478
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,195
Do you still have that photo?

479
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,322
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

480
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,116
I need that picture urgently, okay?

481
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,535
You think maybe you can find it
and send it over?

482
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,537
You can take a pic of it with your phone.

483
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,873
<i>All right, I'll send it to you</i>
<i>when I get home.</i>

484
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,210
Thanks. Get a clear shot if you can.

485
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,294
[line clicks]

486
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,424
When I get the photo,
check it if you want.

487
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,801
See your dad for yourself.

00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,136
[scoffs]

489
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,278
[handyman] These damn brats.

490
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,365
Uh… Fucking hell.

491
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,536
WILL DR. DEOKHEE KEEP HIS CROWN?

492
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,664
I already told you. I don't know.

493
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,250
[sighs]

494
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,962
Look at the picture closer.

495
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,217
I don't know what you want me to do.
I can't remember, all right?

496
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,385
Ah, for fuck's sake.

497
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,976
[sighs]

498
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,435
Shit.

499
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,481
[chuckles] And so, I thought about
getting that treatment for myself.

500
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,358
But my friends said, "Don't do it.

501
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,402
It doesn't really work
and it's a waste of money."

502
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,862
[chuckles] That's what I thought at first.
But I did it,

503
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,115
-and it actually made a huge difference.
-Oh.

504
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,119
Well, it hurts a little. But it works
much better than the old laser treatments.

505
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,330
Oh. They were lying to keep it
for themselves while I look like this.

506
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,750
[both laughing]

507
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,545
No, it's okay. I'll hook you up
with a really good clinic later.

508
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,796
-[gasps] Wait. Really?
-Yeah.

509
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,089
-[phone ringing]
-Oh.

510
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,592
-Excuse me a minute.
-Sure.

511
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,977
So, Eunchae Song,
she's pretty straightforward.

512
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,146
[Dr. Choi] <i>What did she say?</i>

513
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,481
You were right. She confirmed it.

514
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,358
Rottweiler fur no less.

515
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,695
<i>The official report will be handed</i>
<i>to the police tomorrow afternoon.</i>

516
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,905
Okay, thank you.

517
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,074
Make sure there won't be any issues later.

518
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,286
<i>Sure, don't worry. I've got it covered.</i>

[door closes]

521
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,849
[Dr. Choi] I heard you filled in
for Dr. Song in the OR again today.

522
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,102
Yeah.

523
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,773
It was an AT/RT. I wanted to do it.

524
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,652
Uyeong is concerned about you.
He says you're addicted to stimulants.

525
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,866
[sighs] Whatever he said to you,
he's wrong.

526
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,035
It's not true.

527
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,537
Of course.

528
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,372

and here.

533
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,061
All of those pathways…

534
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,900
if I follow all of them
right up to the end,

535
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,152
what will I find?

536
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,284
Humanity at its essence. All that we are.

537
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,832
What if I die before I get to explore
all these different paths?

538
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,418
You will if you don't start
taking better care of yourself.

539
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,467
[sighs] I know I should sleep more.

540
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,635
I already know that.

But things like sleeping,
things like eating,

542
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,727

Promise me one thing.

546
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,577
From now on, you will eat right
and get enough sleep.

547
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,829
That's the only way
you'll make it to the end.

548
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,502
As for these, I'm taking them away.

I want you to know something.

You should've just told me
the truth right away.

639
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:57,023
You should've said,
"That Myeongjin Kim is a bastard,

and I hate his guts.

641

So I need you to kill him."

642
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,114

00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,116
"Gladly.

Remember the animal fur we found
on the victim's clothes?

686
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,335
Well, we got an email
from the NFS earlier,

687
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,712
and it turned out to be Rottweiler fur.

688
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,550
The victim didn't own any dogs,
so I guess it came from the killer.

689
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:03,472
But a brain surgeon who owns a Rottweiler
probably isn't very common.
