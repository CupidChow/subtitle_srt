00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,646
[gang member] We should go.

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,982
[gang member 2] Yeah.

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,524

HYPER KNIFE

8
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,963
[surgeon] Knife.

9
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,934
Retractor.

-[spectator] What the hell?
-[spectator 2] Why?

13
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,893
-It wasn't me.
-Hey, shut it.

14
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,520
-Seriously. I swear.
-He's mine. I saw him.

15
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,063
No, I'm telling the truth.

16
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,356
[spectator] Hey. Get off!

17
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,900
-Who was that?
-It was him, okay?

18
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,568
-[murmuring]
-It was him.

19
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,490
[murmuring continues]

20
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,503
Hey! Everyone out!

21
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,048
-[murmuring]
-[spectator] Get out.

22
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,052
I don't know. Hey. I said…
[speaks indistinctly]

23
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,064
[sighs]

24
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,334
Is there something on my face?

25
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,295
Sorry, Doctor. I lost focus.

26
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,881
Get out.

27
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,296
Dr. Han, please wake up the patient.

28
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,132
Waking up the patient.

29
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,803
-What do you mean?
-We have to monitor him

30
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,347
to ensure we don't damage
the language center of his brain

31
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,684
while removing the tumor. That means
we have no other choice but to wake him.

32
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,561
Dr. Han, what are you doing?

33
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,354
We're waiting on you here.

34
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,555
The patient's awake.

35
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,308
Stimulator.

36
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,815
Sir. Can you hear the sound of my voice?

37
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,652
I know this feels a bit strange,
but just relax.

38
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,405
You're Doobong Kim, is that right?

39
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,115
Uh-huh.

40
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,117
That's my name.

41
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,413
I heard you're on the most wanted list.
What crime did you commit?

42
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,751
I've done a lot of things.

43
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,212
What kinds of things?

44
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,214
[Doobong] Well…

45
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,468
Very…

46
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,596
many…

47
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,476
things…

48
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,395
[groans]

49
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,775
[stammering]

50
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,944
Okay, here it is.

51
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,738
-I found it. Let's begin.
-Right.

52
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,823
[surgeon] CUSA.

53
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
Okay.

54
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,631
Done.

55
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,259
Take care of the rest.
You can do it on your own.

56
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,803
-[staff member] Thank you, Doctor.
-[staff] Thank you.

57
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,887
[doctor] Give me a hand.

58
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,685
RESTRICTED AREA

59
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,646
I'm sure you're tired.
How are you holding up, Doctor?

60
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,856
Why do you ask?

61
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,233
-I-I was just wondering.
-[sighs]

62
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,235
-Well, stop wondering.
-Right.

63
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,112
[sergeant] Doctor.

64
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,826
SERGEANT LEE WANIL

65
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,537
There's this guy Min.

66
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,706
He's a well-known
black-market surgery broker.

67
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,999
Black-market surgery?

68
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,335
Yes. In order to catch him,
we raided one of his facilities.

69
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,420
NEUROSURGERY CHOI DEOKHEE

70
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,297
This video was on his hard drive.

71
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,426
Brain surgery was honestly
our very first guess.

72
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,388
At the end of the day, we didn't know
what we were looking at though.

73
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,765
Can you tell us
what kind of operation this is?

74
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,392
[surgeon] Uh…

75
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,561
[Wanil] What is it?
Does something seem off?

76
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,063
[surgeon] No.

77
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,773
Nothing seems off.

78
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,237
Dr. Choi, you should take a look at this.

79
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,952
Here.

80
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,419
[Dr. Choi] Black-market surgeries, huh?

81
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,796
And how far along is the investigation?

82
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,133
-[sighs] We haven't really…
-The video, that's it?

83
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,428
Yes, this 50-minute video,
it's all we have at the moment.

84
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,223
[sighs]

85
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,934
What? What is it?
Is there something wrong?

86
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,810
You see,

87
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,480
it's hard to say exactly
what kind of operation it is

88
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,065
based off of this video alone.

89
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,277
What I can say is that the surgical site
is very deep in the base of the brain,

90
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,987
which is hard to execute.

91
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,990
A surgery like this is impossible
outside of a real OR.

92
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,534
Poor conditions.

93
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,038
Dr. Choi has technically performed
the only successful case in the country.

94
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,751
So you're saying
this patient very likely died as a result?

95
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,754
Yes, that's right. That is very likely.

96
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,798
All right. Just send over the file.

97
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,093
We'll take a closer look later.

98
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,928
Sure. Sounds good.

99
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,137
Ah. Here.

100
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,222
Thanks.

101
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,183
-I'll send you the file right away.
-Oh, okay.

102
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,269
We'll contact you shortly.

103
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,353
Great.

104
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,275
[door closes]

NEUROSURGEON DR. CHOI DEOKHEE

106
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,075
Dr. Choi.

107
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,119
About the video…

108
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,372
Those were woman's hands, weren't they?

109
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,499
Not sure.

110
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,419
Is there any chance that it's Seok?

111
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,504
It could be her.

112
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,715
What if it is her?

113
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,717
Don't you have work?

114
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,468
Yes.

115
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,803
I'll get back to it.

116
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,475
[phone ringing]

117
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,484
[Dr. Choi] Hi, it's me.

118
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,570
Ah, Dr. Choi.

119
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,696
[sighs] <i>Listen.</i>

120
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
<i>There's someone I really need to find.</i>

121
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,575
Who is it?

122
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,618
<i>He goes by Min.</i>

123
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,454
He's an illegal surgery broker.

124
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,914
Don't know his full name.

125
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,335
Okay.
So "Min, the illegal surgery broker."

126
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,671
Anything else?

127
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,840
[Dr. Choi] The police are onto him.

128
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>Oh. Makes things easier.</i>

129
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,136
<i>I'll call you as soon as I find him.</i>

130
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,305
How long would it take?

131
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,057
<i>Uh… One week?</i>

132
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,142
[gasps] Could be too late.

133
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,103
<i>Oh. This must be a pretty urgent matter.</i>

134
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,315
<i>I'll try to hurry things along, okay?</i>

135
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,152

[sighs]

138
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,286
You're awake.

139
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,830
Yeah.

140
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,915
Want some water?

141
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,084
Here you go.

142
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,335
Mm-hmm.

143
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,304
What are you doing? Stop it.

144
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,473
Stay still.

145
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,350
Just looking.

146
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,813
[grunts]

147
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,107
Please don't.

148
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,360
Okay, Cranky Ass.

149
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,407
If I hadn't operated on you,
you'd have died, you little shit.

150
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
Show some respect.

151
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,416
You should've just let me die then.

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,264
[rhythmic beeping]

153
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,063
Doctor.

154
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,233
He woke up only an hour ago.

155
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,320
Everything's normal
except for his pulse rate. It's a bit low.

156
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,322
Mr. Kim?

157
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,532
Can you see my fingers?

158
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,460
Are you the doctor from before?

159
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,754
Yeah, I performed your surgery.

160
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,964
Now,

161
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,925
how many fingers?

162
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,638
Please answer her, Boss.
You were talking just fine earlier.

163
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,974
How many?

164
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,231
Can you not hear me?

165
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,483
I'm grateful.

166
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,954
97, 98, 99, 100?

167
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,333
Five mill?

168
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,507
What do these asshole take me for?

169
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,261
[assistant] Excuse me. Wait a minute.
Here's some bread.

170
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,930
-[gang member] Cool. Thank you.
-[gang member 2] Wow, it looks good.

171
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,014
Thank you.

172
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,816
-Hi. We have to eat.
-[assistant] I'm busy.

173
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,776
Go eat with Dr. Han.

174
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,862
[surgeon] He said he wasn't hungry.
How's maeun-tang sound?

175
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,241
Maeun-tang?

176
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,370
At 2:00 a.m., in the mountains?

177
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,957
I said we have to eat
'cause I'm starving, okay?

178
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,503
There's bread over there.
Go eat that instead!

179
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,588

180
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,965
You…

181
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,558
[person] Dr. Seok Jeong?

182
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,608
I thought it was you.

183
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,359
I was right.

184
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,616
How do you know my name?

185
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,994
I was a nurse
at Yeonshin University Hospital.

186
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,204
I was there around when you left.

187
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh.

188
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,377
People really talked.

189
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,590
-What do you mean "they talked"?
-You know.

190
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,136
You and Dr. Choi.

191
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,281
[Seok] <i>So about the new nurse…</i>

192
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,076
Did Dr. Han hire her?

193
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,081
[assistant] No, the gangsters
were the ones who brought her.

194
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,041
We actually couldn't find anyone.

195
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,293
Why do you ask?

196
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,630
We've got to be careful
about who we work with.

197
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,425
She could squeal
and totally screw us over.

198
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,678
Nah, she wouldn't do that.

199
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,139
You know why?
She's hiding a lot of things too.

200
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,934
Oh?

201
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,396
Yeah. She committed malpractice
at a university hospital.

202
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,108
So she was kicked out and then
went to work at a convalescent hospital.

203
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,335
[rhythmic beeping]

204
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,088
[door closes]

205
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,346
[assistant] <i>She's a terrible person.</i>

206
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,141
[Seok] <i>What? How's she terrible?</i>

207
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,563
[assistant] <i>At the convalescent hospital,</i>
<i>she gave strange meds to the elderly folks</i>

208
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,857
<i>who were too sick to move or speak.</i>

209
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>And I heard she would beat them up.</i>

210
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,446
<i>Eventually, she got caught</i>
<i>and was kicked out of there too.</i>

211
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,741
[Seok] <i>Oh. So she's a total bitch.</i>

212
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,790
Have you eaten?

213
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,547
What is this?

214
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,636
It's my business card.

215
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,015
[grunts]

216
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,225
Went through my stuff, huh?

217
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,187
I run a pharmacy.

218
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
Oh, really?

219
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,107
Why would I lie about that?

220
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,568
Didn't you hear what happened?

221
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,196
I lost my medical license as you know.

222
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,740
Do you think I've just
been sitting on my ass?

223
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,159
I've gotta do something.

224
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,374
And what about Dr. Choi?
Did you two stay in touch?

225
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,219
He should've woken up by now.

226
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,014
Mr. Kim. Please wake up.
I need to change your dressing.

227
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,724
[nurse] I put him down for a nap.

228
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,063
[nurse chuckles]

229
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,900
It was the only way
we could talk privately.

230
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,528
There are eyes everywhere else.

231
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,866
How much did you get paid for this?

232
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,786
I got five mill, that's it.

233
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,541
[chuckles]

234
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,376
Does it really matter what I got?

235
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,545
Why do you wanna know?

236
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,088
Well, I thought about it.

237
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,884
And I realized that you probably got paid
a lot more than I did.

238
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,762
Why should I get paid less than you?

239
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,475
Out of the two of us,
you're the one without a license.

240
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,980
I guess I'm just saying
it feels a little unfair.

241
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,774
Don't you agree?

242
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,821
A doctor without a license
performing brain surgeries.

243
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,657
Outside a hospital.

244
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,286
I'm only saying this
because I worry for you, Doctor.

245
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,205
You might end up in jail.

246
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,541
Money?

247
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,003
How much? I'm busy so get it over with.

248
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,880
Three mill a month.

249
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,506
What? Too much?

250
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,551
Fine, two million then.

251
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,846
I can't go any lower than that.

252
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,598
I got to make a living too.

253
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,976
And we're partners now,
so you should give me that much at least.

254
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,563
Ah…

255
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,941
Partners?

256
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,069
How nice.

257
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,946
Great timing too.

258
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,740
-We were looking for a nurse.
-Oh, no.

259
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,243
I'm tired of the OR
so I won't be joining you.

260
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,002
I perform the surgery

261
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:44,131
while you refuse to set foot in the OR.

262
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,843
What exactly will you be doing then?

263
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,555
-Are we partners or not?
-I can overlook all of this.

264
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,642
I'll keep quiet for you

265
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,811
for your own safety.

266
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,325
In that case, you've got yourself a deal.

267
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,287
Safety.

268
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,166
Safety first, always.

269
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,171
Give me your bank account info.

270
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,155
-[refrigerator door opens]
-[glass clinks]

271
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,991
[refrigerator door closes]

272
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,831
[sighs]

273
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,915
All right.

274
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,251
Here you go.

275
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,215
Wow, I didn't think you'd come
all the way here.

276
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,299
[chuckles]

277
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,429
Well, it was only natural.

278
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,598
Mrs. Ra, I've heard nothing
but positive things

279
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,726
about you and your work over the years.

280
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,771
Yet, I was still surprised
when I got your call.

281
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,065
Even my wife doesn't know this number,
you know.

282
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,651
You are truly amazing.

283
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,987
Well, thank you
for all of your kind words.

284
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,698
This is Dr. Choi.

285
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,036
My name is Deokhee Choi.

286
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,289
[laughs]

287
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,466
This is what the fuss is about, huh?
[chuckles]

288
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,761
Stupid ass cops barking up the wrong tree.

289
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,931
It's true that I had this, but still.
It has nothing to do with me, okay?

290
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,641
I just got it from the Chinese guys.

291
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,226
Chinese guys?

292
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,688
Yeah, there are people in China who are
doing these kinds of things illegally too.

293
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,858
All I know is
they sent me this video out of nowhere.

294
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,736
They said that the doctor is Korean
and they wanted me to find them.

295
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,781
So I pretended to look for a bit,
but that's it.

296
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,908
How long ago was that? Do you know?

297
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,827
-[associate] Last spring, I think.
-[Min] Hmm…

298
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,371
Can you tell us why
you only pretended to look?

299
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,749
'Cause brain operations are one thing
we don't touch.

300
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,961
Who'd be crazy enough to illegally crack
open their head for brain surgery?

301
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,090
We mostly deal with livers and kidneys
and stuff.

302
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,218
Nah, this is just too wild.

303
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,513
Mr. Min, you have the entire video,
don't you?

304
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,473
Nope, this is all I received too.

305
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,850
The Chinese guys said it was all they had.

306
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,940
Anyway. What are you gonna do
with the entire video?

307
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,818
The surgery,

308
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,904
I was wondering if it was successful.

309
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,450
The Chinese guys were dying to know
about that too.

310
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,828
But is there a reason for it, Doctor?

311
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,666
It's a difficult procedure. That's all.

312
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,252
[laughs] Doesn't that go
for all brain surgeries?

313
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,506
Some parts are especially difficult.

314
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,094
-And which ones are those?
-[high-pitched ringing]

315
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,226
-[ringing fades]
-Thank you for taking the time to meet us.

316
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,747
You said it was a difficult procedure.

317
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,917
They must've failed, then.

318
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,795
What are you going to do now?

319
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,550
Guess I should ask the person
who performed the surgery.

320
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,970
Does that mean you know who it is?

321
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,139
Of course I do.

322
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,183
How could I not? It's obvious.

323
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,479
Wait a second.

324
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,856
Is it someone I know?

325
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,026
Who is it then--

326
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,320
That girl?

327
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,078
Why do you think I'm asking? [chuckles]

328
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,164
Because I wanna see you.

329
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,207
Let me buy you a nice meal.

330
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,960
Last time,
you were the one who treated me, so…

331
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,546
No. I'm saying it's my turn.

332
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,473
I heard you and Inspector Yang grew up
in the same town?

333
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,559
Yes.

334
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:52,356
In Hapcheon, if you didn't know
Deokhee Choi, you were a northern spy.

335
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,691
He's been a genius since he was young.

336
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,110
[companion gasps] Mmm… That's amazing.

337
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,029
Yeah. And you know what else?

338
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,324
In our little town, there was one school,
and that was it.

339
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,034
We didn't even have a bookstore.

340
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,703
But this guy gets into med school
at age 17.

341
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,330
-[gasps] Hmm…
-Get this,

342
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,082
-with the highest score.
-[gasps]

343
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,000
That was long ago.

344
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,877
[Yang grunts] So what if it was?

345
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,171
It's not like I was telling a lie.

346
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,928
[Yang clears throat]

347
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,098
Oh, that's right.

348
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,809
Did you talk to Wanil Lee

349
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,561
about that illegal surgery video?

350
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,398
[high-pitched ringing]

351
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,905
[Yang, distorted] You said only you can
do that surgery in all of Korea.

352
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,366
[normal audio] If that's true,
you can easily help us find out

353
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,784
who this is, right?

354
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,578
Do all you can to help us out here.

355
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,164
Of course.

356
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,336
[companion] Are you all right?

357
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,381
What's wrong? Are you not well?

358
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,467
It's nothing. I'm fine.

359
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,996
We'll call someone to clean the floors
and windows later.

360
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,789
Oh, please be careful, that's expensive.

361
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,124
-Hey, be careful.
-Come on.

362
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,751
Didn't you hear what he said?

363
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,045
[Seok] <i>I also removed the catheter</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

364
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,297
The swelling has gone down more or less.

365
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,009
It looks like you're ready
to be transported now.

366
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,345
<i>You'll be able to move</i>
<i>around in about a week.</i>

367
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,097

<i>until then…</i>

368
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,516
-Easy.
-<i>…so there's no need to worry.</i>

369
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,977
The surgery went so well
that there won't be any issues.

370
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,146
-I'll still let you know how he's doing.
-Mm-hmm.

[Doobong] Sanggi.

372
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,399
-The bed.
-Would you like to sit up?

373
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,739
-Let me give you some privacy.
-Mmm…

00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,672
Thank you, Doctor.

378
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,217
I owe you everything.

379
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,556
You already know what kind of person I am.

380
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,268
Please let me know if you ever need help,

381
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,188
no matter the problem.

382
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,832
Our problems,

383
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,334
only we can solve them.

384
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,933
-Keep an eye on him, okay?
-I'll contact you.

385
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,895
-Let's go!
-[staff] Yes, sir.

[siren wailing]

387
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,670
When do I get to leave?

388
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,756
[Seok] After we finish up with all
the cleaning, I'll give you a ride home.

389
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,180
All righty, then.

390
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,933
I'd feel safer riding in your car anyway.

391
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,229
A cup of coffee sounds good right now.

392

393
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,245

[thunder rumbling]

395
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,129
So you're a team of three?

396
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,466
That unfriendly anesthesiologist,
Dr. Jeong, and yourself.

397
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,219
-How many surgeries do you do per month?
-[sighs]

398
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,846
-No idea.
-Yeah, right.

399
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,765
Aren't you her manager?

400
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,892
I'm not her manager.

401
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,519
Then what exactly do you do?

402
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,696
I guess I should go ahead
and ask Dr. Jeong.

403
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,538
I drive, clean, do her laundry and tend to
whatever else Ms. Seok needs, all right?

404
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,623
Satisfied?

405
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,001
Now where the hell is this thing?

406
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,509
Hold on.

407
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,221
-Did you take my water?
-Why would I even do that?

408
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,933
You're a weird person.

Why do you need this cooler?

Hey, don't swing that around!

413
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,330
-What's in it?
-None of your business.

414
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,789
Got it?

415
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,668
Just take it to Dr. Han quickly.
He forgot it.

416
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,046
-Right now?
-Of course right now.

417
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,299
He says it's urgent! Now move it.

418
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,107
It'll get contaminated if you open it.
So just don't.

419
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,109

-Yeah.

Yes, Doctor?

423
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,147
You shouldn't sleep in your car.

424
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,984
Somewhere in town, there's a sauna.
Go rest up there for a while.

425
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,071
I really wish I could, but I don't know.

426
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,740
We can't do anything right now
because of the rain.

427
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,659
We still gotta lot to burn.

428
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,495
We can burn it all in the morning
when the sun's out.

429
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,582
-You should go get some rest for now.
-I guess I'll go rest for a little.

[Ms. Ra] I was surprised.
She hasn't changed one bit.

[Ms. Ra] Those are actually her dogs.

They're Rottweilers.

for being very fierce.

I fell down trying to get away.

Since she was so annoying,

516

I strangled her to death.

00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,935
-See you around.
-Yeah.

532
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,694
MARI'S DINER

533
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,950
[Seo]
<i>Wait, that ankle monitor guy again?</i>

534
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,202
[sighs] What a weirdo.

535
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,122
Why was he even looking at you though?

536
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,374
If I had to guess, he thinks I'm pretty.

537
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,334
Come on.

538
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,961
No way.

539
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,839
Anyway, he's been lurking around me
a lot more than usual.

540
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,215
It's annoying.

541
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,301
-Does that mean you're gonna kill him?
-Are you crazy?

542
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,054
-Why would you even think that?
-Well, you just said he was annoying.

543
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,434
You're talking as if you think
I'm a weirdo too. You know that?

544
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,768
'Cause you are one.

545
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,187
-How am I weird then, huh?
-Don't you remember?

546
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,274
You just sent me on an errand
not that long ago to kill that nurse.

547
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,526
So what? It's my fault?

548
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,987
I already told you what she said.
What would you have done, nothing?

549
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,405
Well, I wouldn't have killed her.

550
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,449
It was self-defense.

551
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,868
Ms. Seok.

552
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,744
It's premeditated murder to drug her,

553
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,414
wait for the right moment,
and then strangle her to death.

554
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,916
[sighs] You're a total psychopath,
you know.

555
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,669
You heard from Dr. Han, by the way?

556
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,588
When are we going to operate again?

557
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,757
Don't even think about operating. And also
don't kill any more people, please!

558
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,803
Since I saved one life,

559
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,430
I ended another.

560
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,515
So I did the world a favor.

561
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,352
-Don't say anything like that ever again.
-[phone ringing]

562
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,688
Go away.

563
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,149
-[ringing stops]
-Yeah?

564
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,319
[Mr. Choi] <i>Hi, are you home?</i>

565
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,491
<i>I hear you live in Paju these days.</i>

566
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,242
<i>I'll be there soon.</i>

567
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,120
<i>It's been a while since I've seen you.</i>

568
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,124
[phone beeps]

569
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,754
[Mr. Choi] <i>So you did nothing wrong?</i>
<i>You refuse to leave?</i>

570
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,672
-Yeah.
-Get her out.

571
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,592
I said out!

572
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,968
[Seok breathing shakily]

573
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,222
-Hey, let's go. Quickly.
-Get off.

574
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,015
-No, you can't…
-Get off!

575
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,433
-No!
-That's enough!

576
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,060
-This is my surgery!
-Hey, Seok!

577
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,269
-Mine!
-Seok!

578
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,980
-Let me finish my surgery!
-Seok!

579
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,857
[Seok breathing heavily]

580
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:30,027
[surgeon] Hey, Seok. Seok.
Sit down for a minute, okay?

581
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,405
Just sit down. Yeah? Calm down.

582
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,157
Seguk, go check on the patient.

583
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,538
[surgeon] Hey. Seok.

584
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,581
Ah…

585
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,292
Shit. Wait. Seok!

586
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,919
Okay. Excuse me, sorry.

587
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,424
[resident] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

588
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,969
-[grunting]
-[resident] Whoa! Hey! Seok!

589
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,220
Hey, what's going on?

590
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,139
-[resident 2] Go, go, go. Hurry!
-[surgeon] Hey! Jeong!

591
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,724
What the hell are you doing?

592
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,185
-[surgeon] Are you crazy?
-Seok Jeong!

593
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,562
Seok!

594
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,897
Seok! Hey!

595
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,910
You strangled me because
I kicked you out of the OR?

596
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,247
You're reckless and thoughtless!

597
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,041
That's your issue.

598
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,753
What?

599
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,672
Does it feel unfair?

600
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,924
[spits]

601
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,428
[both grunt]

602
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,398
Listen carefully, Seok.

603
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,692
I'll make sure

604
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,444
you'll never,

605
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,196
for the rest of your life,

606
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,491
set foot in an OR again…

607
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,038
even though you can't live without it.

608
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,682
[sobs]

609
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,354
[sobbing]

610
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,856
[thunder rumbling]

611
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,689
[screaming]

612
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,573
[continues screaming]

613
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,494
Ms. Seok.

614
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,704
[Seok sighs]

615
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,039
Just stay in your room.

616
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,478
I didn't come empty-handed.

617
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,476
Oh, so you came to the conference.

618
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,895
[Seok] No, I watched it online.

619
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,357
You should've been there.
Everyone would've been glad to see you.

620
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,278
Aren't you curious to know
how your peers are doing?

621
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,196
Not at all.

622
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,074
Uyeong Ha became the department head
last year.

623
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,703
And all of the others have
become professors.

624
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,415
I guess you've gotten quite old,

625
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,126
seeing as how you're blabbering
about all sorts of crap, huh?

626
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,921
You could have become a full professor
by now too,

627
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,007
if you had just kept working under me.

628
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,468
If you have something to say,
just say it already.

629
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,471
I'm dying to know why the hell
you're showing your face here.

630
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,098
You've got some nerve, you know that?

631
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,392
You run a pharmacy.

632
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,562
How is it?

633
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,314
Why do you care?

634
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,287
[chuckles]

635
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,290
I didn't know you were stalking me
like this.

636
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,709
Where the hell did you get this anyway?

637
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,920
You've improved
since the last time I saw you.

638
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,725
I haven't even offered you a drink,
have I?

639
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,144
I'll be back in a sec.

640
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,170
[high-pitched ringing]

641
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,553
[high-pitched ringing continues]

642
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,602
[ringing continues, fades]

643
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,743
Go ahead.

644
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,328
[chuckles]

645
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,593
Well, what do you think?

646
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,929
It's too sweet, isn't it?

647
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,473
[sighs] Just a little, I guess.

648
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,440
I've been having health issues.

649
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,524
[Seok chuckles]

650
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,153
-Yeah, I've noticed.
-Brainstem glioma.

651
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,363
Luckily, I found it early.

652
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,035
Uyeong Ha could operate on you, ya know.

653
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,830
It's a tough location, which is worrying.

654
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,914
Right.

655
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,585
Uyeong's a coward,
so I guess that won't work.

656
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,337
Who else is there?

657
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,508
Boston guy.
Isn't he your biggest fan and all?

658
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:14,593
-[Dr. Choi sighs]
-Alan Kim.

659
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,970
I can't have any post-op side effects.

660
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,638
You see,

661
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,682
these are crucial.

662
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,060
I have to continue operating.

663
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,104
[scoffs]

664
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,067
Well, now that you're old.
Isn't it normal to have shaky hands…

665
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,612
[chuckles] …with or without
post-op side effects?

666
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,364
These aren't any normal hands, are they?

667
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,202
[scoffs] You're getting greedy
in your old age.

668
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,497
Enough is enough. You should retire.

669
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,167
I plan on taking two months to recover.
That's all the time I have.

670
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,836
In other words,
the surgery has to be perfect and--

671
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:52,923
Forget it.

672
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,008
I'm never perfect anyway.

673
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,595
I'll get everything ready, so all you have
to do is show up and operate.

674
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,679
[chuckles]

675
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,682
[laughing]

676
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,104
[sighs]

677
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,523
Are you insane?

678
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,610
[scoffs] Seems like
you've lost your mind for real.

679
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,362
How could I perform a surgery, huh?

680
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,405
I don't even have a license.

681
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,492
I'll call you when we have the date.

682
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,036
You're crazy.

683
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,371
Why should I?

684
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,791
The police are looking for you.

685
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,211
You can perform
your black-market surgeries for now,

686
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,004
if you want to keep it that way.

687
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,631
You know how.

688
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,591
You don't have a choice.

689
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,222
You've always been like this.

690
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,141
All you ever wanted to do was break me.

691
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,477
So I did what you wanted!

692
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,272
And now you wanna do it all over again?

693
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:56,528
Maybe. If I have to, then I will.

694
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,071
[scoffs]

695
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,699
Why don't you just cut my hands off
so I can't do anything?

696
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,701
Go ahead!

697
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,496
If you hate the sight of them so much,
just cut them off and go!

698
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,823
[groaning]

699
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,910
I don't even wanna call you a cab,

700
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,870
so don't ask me to.

701
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:30,914
[groaning continues]

702
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,360
