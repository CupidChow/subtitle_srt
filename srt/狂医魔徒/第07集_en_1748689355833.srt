1
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,859
Ms. Seok.

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,579
It's okay.

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,873
You can handle a few more steps.

4
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,460
Keep walking.

5
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,897
Hey, look. Blood.

00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,650

9
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,472
I'll go over the procedure with the family
later. And then get their consent.

10
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,557
-Okay. Explain it clearly.
-Of course.

11
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,480
JEONG SEOK

12
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,899
Oh, hey.

13
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,695
What did you mean earlier?
You said he's dying soon.

14
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,906
Just what I said.

15
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,492
I saw his MRI results.

16
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,994
I saw his CT too. So what?

17
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,288
Then you should know.

18
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,708
He just needs surgery,
so would you stop freaking out?

19
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,210
You think that's operable?

20
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,172
If you were operating, he'd die, yeah.

21
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,591
Not if I do it, and I will!

22
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,262
I just need to be careful
not to damage his motor function.

23
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,139
Whether or not he'll be able to
use his hands is the issue--

24
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
Seok.

25
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,190
Send them to me.

26
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,776
The MRI scans you saw.

27
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,070
Okay, sure.

28
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,989
See them for yourself.

29
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,049
- Hi, Dr. Choi.
- Did I wake you?

30
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,550
No. Go ahead.

31
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,345
I just wanted
to thank you for the package.

32
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,554
But is this it?

33
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,723
It doesn't seem like much.

34
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,017
I tried everything to get you more, but…

35
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,520
I'm sorry. That was the best I could do.

36
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,774
Even those, uh, I had to say
I needed them for research,

37
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,442
just to get my hands on them.

38
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,569
How many are in here?

39
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,404
Four.

40
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,575
Well, I guess that's that.

41
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,751
You took time out of your busy
schedule, and I couldn't even pick you up.

42
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,253
I'm really sorry.

43
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,879
No, it's all right.

44
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,173
How's your stay been?

45
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,009
It's been a while
since I enjoyed a break like this.

46
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,053
-I kinda don't wanna leave.
-Hmm.

47
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,597
When do you think you'll be home?

48
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,267
I was planning on leaving today.

49
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,602
However, something unexpected came up.

50
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,687
Oh.

51
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,564
I'll be there tomorrow though.

52
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,317
Sound good? We'll talk surgery then.

53
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,486
-Yeah, all right.
-Mm-hmm.

00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,043
Aren't you going to bed?

56
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,670
You go ahead.

57
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,889
Do you really think
Dr. Choi could've killed that guy?

58
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,932
Of course he did.

59
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,769
I didn't think of him as someone who'd…

60
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,898
Wait, what did you do with the… the body?

61
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,316
How did he get rid of it?

62
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,611
Just don't worry about it. He handled it.

63
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,490
How could I not worry? Didn't you see
all the police back there?

64
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,620
If he hadn't killed him, the two of us
would've been caught right then and there.

65
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,913
He even got us a getaway car.

66
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,500
What's your point? What?
Do you want me to send him a gift card?

67
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,338
-No, that's not what I was saying. I…
-Hey, shut it!

DR. CHOI'S MRI SCANS.ZIP

70
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,367
Is his condition really that bad?

71
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,455
These are nothing like the CT scans
he gave to Dr. Han.

72
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,293
You lied again, you son of a bitch.

73
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,005
You're not gonna let him die, are you?

74
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,762
You're going to operate on him, right?

75
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,974
Sick as he is,
he's even killed someone for you.

76
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,726
You can't just let him die.

77
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,734
I know how much he means to you, Ms. Seok.

78
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,904
Don't be cruel. Just save him.

79
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,035
If you care, you've gotta do this.

80
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,879
MIN HYEONJU
AGE: 44

81
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,090
Cause of death was blood loss
from a stab wound to the spleen.

82
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,636
The weapon was a narrow, sharp object,
approximately 1 cm in width.

83
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,722
Now, what you'll want to focus on is here.

84
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,016
This stab wound here.

85
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,479
Based on the angle of the wound,
he must've been stabbed like this.

86
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,356
The most interesting tidbit
is that they got him right here,

87
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,733
right between the ribs.

88
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,111
So they deliberately targeted the spleen.

89
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,406
They might've aimed for the spleen
to cause internal bleeding.

90
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,241
At least, that's what I'm thinking.

91
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,744
You said they walked away
from the scene together?

92
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,498
Huh?

93
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,541
Ah. Uh-huh.

94
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,587
Well, in order to do that, you'd need
to control the bleeding to some extent.

95
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,840
Too much blood loss that fast would cause
you to faint right there on the spot.

96
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,843
The victim would have to be
conscious enough to walk,

97
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,262
- whether on their own or with help.
- It's okay.

98
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,556
You can handle a few more steps.

99
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,602
The spleen is an organ that's filled with
blood, which is why it was targeted.

100
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,312
And the weapon was well-chosen.

101
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,940
Since the external wound was so small,

102
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,734
the blood gradually pooled inside here,

103
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,612
in the abdominal cavity,
instead of flowing out.

104
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,282
That's why they didn't attract attention
when they walked away.

105
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,869
They couldn't have had him bleeding
profusely, or people would've noticed.

106
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,123
If that's really what their intention was,

107
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,875
they must have some medical knowledge.

108
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,502
So, a doctor?

109
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,422
Either they're a doctor, or they're
someone who has had medical training.

110
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,009
Other than that,
there's nothing else unusual here.

111
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,889
If you want my personal opinion
after having done the autopsy,

112
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,684
this was precise.

113
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,358
Huh? Wait.

114
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,153
Rewind. A few seconds back.

115
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,237
Okay.

116
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,409
Oh.
So that's the guy, huh?

117
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,162
The damn doctor
that Min was gonna turn in.

118
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,916
One of the few working CCTVs
got him from the back.

119
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,879
How are we supposed to find the guy?

120
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,924
Well, I guess you'll have to go through
every doctor with a record, huh?

121
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,635
Look at the way he popped the guy
so smoothly.

122
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,345
I bet he's done this before.

123
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,307
Inspector?

124
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,435
Maybe we should request a gait analysis.

125
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,313
Yeah. We've gotta try everything.

126
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,565
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, you wanna grab some coffee?

127
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,944
What are you doing in here all the time?
Don't you have stuff to do? Don't you?

128
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,029
Did the chief…

129
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,574
He sent you here to check on me,
didn't he?

130
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,453
No, you little shit. I just came here
'cause I'm worried, so get off my back.

131
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,121
Worried? Kiss my ass.

132
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,667
Seriously?

133
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,419
He's in a mood today.

134
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,907

135
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,257
Yeah.

136
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,719
Seong's on the phone.

137
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,558
Hey, what's up, Seong?
Why are you calling so late?

138
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,479
Evening. Min's autopsy results are in.

139
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,400
Whoever it was, it was good.

140
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,944
Real clean work, that's for sure.

141
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,612
Huh. I'm glad to hear it.

142
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,740
One thing… It's a little bit weird though.

143
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,450
The camera shows that a man did it.

144
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,119
Really?

145
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,371
Didn't you say
that it was gonna be a woman?

146
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,083
Anyway… Come by next week
and we can grab dinner.

147
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,918
Yeah, sure. All right, then.

148
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,423
A man?

149
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,182
No, you're in the middle of surgery.

150
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,853
You're Doobong Kim. Is that right?

151
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,772
Uh-huh.

152
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,774
That's my name.

153
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,610
I heard you're on the most wanted list.

154
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,446
What crime did you commit?

155
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,011
Hmm? You're back.

156
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,264
Uh, yeah.

157
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,225
We got hungry while we were waiting.

158
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,310
Have you eaten yet?

159
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,729
No. But I could eat.

160
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,314
I'll join you.

161
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,986
I didn't think you'd be back so soon.

162
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,530
Mmm.
I got to leave earlier than I thought.

163
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,535
-What happened there?
-Mmm. No, that's nothing.

164
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,747
Let me see.

165
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,333
Oh, no, it's fine. Ah.

166
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,212
Did you get bitten?

167
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,380
Wait, this is a human.

168
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm okay.

169
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,760
Was it that creepy cult man?

170
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,221
I guess I made him angry or something.

171
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,056
I had his doctor take over after that.

172
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,809
You should've bitten his hand, then!

173
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,310
I'm being serious.

174
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,020
Right.

175
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,065
Why are you always taking crap
from people like that, huh?

176
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,154
Hey. Go find out where
that cult leader's compound is.

177
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,490
-Why?
-So I can go and tear into his hand

178
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,866
with my own damn teeth!

179
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,787
What are you saying?

180
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,095
Dr. Han.

181
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,848
Yeah.

182
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,934
Can you find me an operating site?

183
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,353
You're gonna do the surgery then?

184
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,522
Yeah, I will.

185
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,607
Did Dr. Choi reach out again?

186
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,027
No, nothing like that.

187
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,988
It's just something I have to do.

188
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,074
Let's focus on saving him for now.

189
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,076
Right.

190
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,081
This is our chairman of the board.

191
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,916
-Alan Kim, sir.
-Great to have you here.

192
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,002
-I'm Jang Byeongho.
-Alan Kim. A pleasure.

193
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,838
Ah. This is Dr. Huisuk Park.

194
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,464
Hi, nice to meet you.

195
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,049
- Nice to meet you too.
- This way.

196
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,760
Wow,
I guess Alan Kim really is a big deal.

197
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,345
Follow me.

198
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,307
Look at the chairman.
He's smiling from ear to ear.

199
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,684
Of course he is. It's Alan Kim.

200
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,520
Kudos to Dr. Choi.

201
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,647
How'd he get him to come all the way here?

202
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,775
Dr. Deokhee Choi and Alan Kim together.

203
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,903
Whoa. I got chills.

204
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,915
It's very different
from the CT scan he showed us.

205
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,296
Do you remember the cerebral artery
bypass surgery from last year?

206
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,006
Yeah.

207
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,592
It snowed so much
that we were really late.

208
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,302
Exactly. That day.

209
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,347
This is pretty similar to that case.

210
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,182
Here.

211
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,393
See how his tumor
is wrapped around the arteries?

212
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,021
That means we gotta remove them
altogether for this to work.

213
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,650
-If the arteries are removed--
-You're gonna use vascular grafts then?

214
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,780
We're collaborating with Boston? On what?

215
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,075
I here it's a cerebral artery
bypass using saphenous vein grafts.

216
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,576
Grafts?

217
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,956
You tried grafts that one time too,
and the hemorrhaging it caused nearly…

218
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,459
That was 'cause… It was
the first time I used one, you know.

219
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,755
Alan Kim may be the best
in cerebrovascular surgery, but…

220
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,340
There's no way, right?

221
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,885
Well, Dr. Choi will be there too,
so they'll figure it out.

222
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,305
It sounds too risky, doesn't it?

223
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,224
Are you sure about this?

224
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,310
I have to do it, and I know I can.

225
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,854
It's just scary, that's all.

226
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,242
Let's do it. Leave it to me.
I'll find us a place to work.

227
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,875
Chairman, director, and president.

228
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,628
I think you've met
just about everyone you needed to.

229
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,008
It must've been exhausting.
Thanks for doing this.

230
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,676
No, I'm fine.

231
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,353
Uh…

232
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,731
I was wondering… That friend…

233
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
When am I going to meet her?

234
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,483
Let's see how things go.

235
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,322
It's exciting.

236
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,245
It's just… Dr. Jeong…
watching her work in that video,

237
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,539
I was just reminded of a friend I had.

238
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,002
Just like her, he never hesitated.
Not in the OR.

239
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,921
He never doubted himself at all.

240
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,341
It was almost like he was a machine.

241
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,637
"Machine." Is that right?

242
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,351
Not sure that Seok would appreciate that.
But I know what you're trying to say.

243
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,145
You wanna know something funny?

244
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:11,233
That guy, he was the biggest jerk.
A real pain to deal with.

245
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,235
In what way?

246
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,072
Uh, he had a strange talent

247
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,950
making everyone around him
into an enemy, no matter who it was.

248
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,205
It's like they say, there's
nothing more obnoxious than a genius.

249
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,458
Especially when he knows he's a genius.

250
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,795
So everyone we knew
always avoided him like the plague.

251
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,089
Not me. I didn't, though.

252
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,300
I was like, "Hey, come on. Come on.

253
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,469
It's okay."

254
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,763
Yeah.

255
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,140
Do you know why I did that?

256
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,475
Hmm, I don't.

257
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,686
'Cause being around people like that,

258
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,897
well, that's how I feel accomplished
in every sense of the word.

259
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,817
You're even more ambitious than I thought.

260
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,112
Yeah. Just a bit, though.

261
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,949
So what's your friend doing these days?

262
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,034
He died.

263
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,537
He had just turned 30.

264
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:10,042
I guess he couldn't handle
being around himself either.

265
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,715
Okay, um…

266
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,550
So, then… Hmm…

267
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,678
Dr. Jeong.
When do you think you'll introduce us?

268
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,644
When are you gonna tell Dr. Choi?

269
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,020
When we're ready.

270
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,231
Can you not do the surgery?

271
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,066
You're the one who told me to!

272
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,362
The vascular grafts are worrisome.
I don't think it's a good idea.

273
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,283
Don't worry about it.

274
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,118
I won't mess it up.

275
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,953
I can't afford to.

276
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,420
Why didn't you answer your phone?

277
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,757
What's the big deal?

278
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,008
Are you free right now?

279
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,333
Ms. Seok.

280
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,547
Wait here. It won't take long.

281
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,235
What do you think of the food?

282
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,571
I'm not picky about food.

283
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,118
My apologies about the situation with Min.

284
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,540
Luckily for us, it looks like the police
haven't found much evidence.

285
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,042
So it seems like
it'll all fizzle out on its own.

286
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,920
There's just one thing.

287
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,715
On the CCTV,
the killer's back could be seen.

288
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,133
A man.

289
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,974
You wanted the guy dead
and that's what you got.

290
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,643
Are you really complaining
just 'cause I didn't do it myself?

291
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,894
I'm just curious, you see.

292
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,773
I doubt it was Dr. Han, so who was it?

293
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,113
Apologies, I meant nothing by it.

294
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,784
You know, I didn't have the guts
to watch my surgery video until now,

295
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,744
so I guess something changed.

296
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,997
'Cause out of nowhere, I got curious.

297
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,540
I watched it yesterday.

298
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,169
And I realized that the human brain
is a fascinating thing,

299
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,798
and the doctors who operate on it
are just as fascinating.

300
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,425
So once again, Doctor,

301
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,469
you have my sincerest gratitude.

302
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,014
How so?

303
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,268
If at any point you need my help,
all you have to do is ask.

304
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,646
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

305
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,689
What's with all this?

306
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,400
Is something wrong?

307
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,110
What do you mean?

308
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,654
Nothing's wrong here.

309
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,287
WE INFORM YOU OF THE PASSING

310
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,830
OF KIM KIYOUNG,
SON OF KIM MYEONGJIN

311
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,254
What?

312
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,091
A friend from school, his son died.

313
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,009
How did he die?

314
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,762
Couldn't tell you.

315
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,775
Haven't you had enough to drink?

316
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,319
Mm-hmm.

317
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,740
You wanted to say something. Go ahead.

318
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,620
Yeah, you're right, I did. I do.

319
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,674
Whoever took out that nurse
at Gwanggyo Temple…

320
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,592
killed Min.

321
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,969
They had to have.

322
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,179
Wanil too.

323
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,349
Right, it's hard to see it any other way.

324
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,021
-Hey.
-What?

325
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,105
Tell me.

326
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,983
Why did you kill Min that day?

327
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,404
Then there's all those
black market surgeries.

328
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,949
I just can't figure it out. Why?

329
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,035
Huh?

330
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,579
A prestigious brain surgeon like yourself.

331
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,415
What are you even saying?

332
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,501
The black market doctor
that Min was going to turn in that day.

333
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,212
That was you.

334
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,632
You killed him in cold blood.

335
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,720
I'm saying I saw you.

336
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,973
Is that what you really saw?

337
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,269
Or would it just be convenient for you?

338
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,980
Bastard. What do you take me for?

339
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,193
Do you think I'd lie
about something I saw?

340
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,865
Wanil's dead, isn't he?

341
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,298
Well, here's the thing.

342
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,177
You're not squeaky-clean here, either.

343
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,931
Now, what does that mean?

344
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,183
What do you know?

345
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,812
Exactly what you're thinking right now.

346
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,899
The dirt that would end you in an instant.

347
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,445
Dongyeong Yang.

348
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,406
Everything's out in the open now.

349
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,492
What shall we do?

350
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,204
Want to go down together?

351
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,584
I know I could handle it, but you…

352
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,172
You'd be leaving your family behind.

353
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,053
YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HALL

354
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,437
REST IN PEACE
CHOI DEOKHEE

355
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,211
Hi, Kiyoung. We're here.

356
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,258
Both me and your father's murderer.

357
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,617
Exactly what you're thinking right now.

358
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,745
The dirt that would end you in an instant.

359
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,707
Want to go down together?

360
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,170
You're going down, and alone.

361
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,343
-Ah, you're here.
-Yeah.

362
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,720
Where is everyone?

363
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,640
They're all at the Medical Association
right now.

364
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,725
-Why are they there?
-To get a list of doctors

365
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,727
who got their licenses revoked for crimes.

366
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,564
Digital forensics sent us
CCTV footage with better resolution.

367
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,276
All right, good. I'll take a look.

368
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,361
Yes, sir.

369
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,247
So, Doctor,
why did you kill Myeongjin Kim?

370
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,249
Do people like us really need a reason?

371
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,085
Do you have a reason for killing people?

372
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,920
Well, sure. That's true.

373
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,505
But there is one, isn't there?

374
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,257
Go home already!

375
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,427
Not till you say what it was.

376
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,517
He had his eye on you.

377
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,145
His eye on me? I don't get it.

378
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,523
He was scouting you for his LA hospital.

379
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,902
I'd never even heard of him
so I had no clue who he was.

380
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,530
All of this, it's news to me.

381
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,368
The chairman recommended
a few doctors in your class.

382
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,579
He wanted you.
Of course you were his first choice.

383
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,666
He could pick out talent at least.

384
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,836
Don't tell me.

385
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,339
You thought that I might actually
go with him there?

386
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,717
Are you serious?

387
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,516
Wow.

388
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,893
You had someone like this?

389
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,938
-Seok Jeong, was it?
-Mmm.

390
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,358
Hey, this kid could make me
a lot of money.

391
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,318
Whoa. This is the one.

392
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,362
She's your favorite, right? Huh?

393
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,782
I've got to poach this girl. Is that okay?

394
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,577
Maybe I just didn't like
what he was saying to me then.

395
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,830
That's all it was, huh?

396
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,832
You just didn't want
that guy to take me away.

397
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,250
That's what you couldn't stand?

398
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,544
That weasel's not a doctor,
he's a businessman.

399
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,923
He always took young surgeons,
put them to work on surgery after surgery.

400
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,717
Just to line his own pockets.

401
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,094
Many came back a wreck
after working for him.

402
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,722
-Rat bastard.
-That son of a bitch dared.

403
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,518
He tried to steal someone
I worked so hard to train.

404
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,978
How insufferable.

405
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,980
You're right, Doctor.

406
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,273
Who did he think he was?

407
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,068
Trying to take something
that was never his.

408
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,237
I would've killed that guy too.

409
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,200
Do you even hear
what you're saying right now?

410
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,534
What's wrong with you?

411
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:11,912
What the hell?

412
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,873
I'm just saying he deserved what he got.

413
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,419
What are youâ€¦

414
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,088
Ugh, you're crazy.

415
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,623
So why did you do that to me, really?

416
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,007
I'm gonna need you to tell me the truth.

417
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,165
Huh?

418
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,343
That's the girl
who was messing with you before, isn't it?

419
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,469
Oh, shit.

420
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,310
Wow. It's been ages since I was here.

421
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,608
Used to be my dream to die
while working in this OR.

422
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,324
Guess it's not used, at least not anymore.

423
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,828
There's a new one,
a larger one in the annex.

424
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,623
That's too bad.

425
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,501
Just spit it out already.

426
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,844
The day that Uyeong Ha got picked
for Boston over me,

427
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,973
I stormed into your office
to tell you off.

428
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,934
I didn't know that his mom was there.

429
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,021
That was the first time you ever hit me,
you know that?

430
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,274
Well, you deserved it that day.

431
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,900
That wasn't where it started though.

432
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,402
It was long before.

433
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,989
When I took over Myeongjin Kim's surgery,

434
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,868
-you've pushed me away ever since then.
-We're doing this again?

435
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,830
So what more do you wanna know about it?

436
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,377
Why you started pushing me away,
the real reason.

437
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,424
You were being a hypocrite back then,
acting like you were so different from me,

438
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,134
and you were ashamed when I caught you!

439
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,469
That's why you kicked me out, isn't it?

440
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,724
When I realized that you actually wanted
to kill that guy for real…

441
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,852
…I was just really thrilled,
you know.

442
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,854
We're just so alike.

443
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,399
But I'm sure you felt like I found
the skeletons in your closet, right?

444
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,360
And that hurt your pride, didn't it?

445
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,029
So what should I have done then?

446
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,824
Admit it all to you?
Should I have told you

447
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,369
that I was gonna kill that asshole, is
that it? What kind of teacher does that?

448
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,126
Right on the money, wasn't I?

449
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,637
Why did it hurt your pride though?
Why was it all so embarrassing to you?

450
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,806
I was the one who found out,
it wasn't just anyone.

451
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,852
You don't know how excited I was, do you?

452
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,271
All you idiots, you have no idea, huh?

453
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,567
"You know what my teacher is?
He's a straight up stone-cold killer,

454
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,902
just like me."

455
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,695
We could be the same person!

456
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,575
Right there.

457
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,702
That's it.

458
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,205
That's not normal.

459
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,460
You're glad to know that
your professor's a murderer?

460
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,878
That's just insane!

461
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,133
Yeah, you're right. I know it is.

462
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,429
Even knowing that,

463
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,307
that's still how I honestly felt…

464
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,939
even though you used to hit me
quite a bit back then,

465
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,650
and even after you got me arrested
and all that other shit.

466
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,611
You brat.

467
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,906
You did your fair share
to me too, all right?

468
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,120
I still don't want you to die, though.

469
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,247
That's the truth.

470
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,711
Uyeong told me everything.

471
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,171
I'll do it.

472
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,510
Why?

473
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,139
You pity me? Is that it?

474
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,808
What?

475
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,477
I asked if it's pity.
That's why you wanna operate, don't you?

476
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,190
What the hell are you talking about
all of a sudden?

477
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,861
I just don't want you to die.
Get that through your thick skull!

478
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,821
How many times do I have to say it?

479
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,410
We're doing this, right?

480
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,079
Right?

481
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,667
The hell? You gonna say
you don't want it anymore?

482
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,671
I'll think about it.

483
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,799
Well, think about what? You need this!

484
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,928
You'll die without it.
You already know that!

485
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,059
Ah, shit.

486
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,022
I ought to just go ahead
and kill you myself!

487
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,988
All right.

488
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,698
You're definitely going through with it.

489
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,409
So I'll call you when I find us an OR.

490
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,412
Just sit tight, you got that?
And don't you dare do anything crazy

491
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,748
like you have been,
going around and murdering people!

492
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,752
Just don't cause anymore trouble, okay?
Am I clear?

493
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,962
Did I make it clear enough for you?

494
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,465
Did you get that through your skull?

495
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,306
You son of a…

496
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,334
You're here.

497
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,212
-You went out for a run?
-Yeah.

498
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,465
This place is really great for it.

499
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,093
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks.

500
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,513
I talked to the hospital chair.

501
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,807
I said that, on our side,

502
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,310
only Uyeong Ha is going in,

503
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,480
that it'll only be the two of you
that day.

504
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,440
-It's all taken care of.
-All right.

505
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,984
That's the official line though.

506
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,822
The one who's actually going in that day
is still Dr. Jeong right?

507
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,073
Of course it is.

508
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,287
-Why? Does it make you anxious?
-No.

509
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,249
Just Dr. Jeong being there
is good enough for me.

510
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:44,632
HANUL SUNGSIM HOSPITAL

511
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,510
So, you can see the preparation
of the donor

512
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,345
and the radial interposition graft.

513
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,222
The graft is slightly short.

514
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,891
But… uh…

515
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,019
we can address this issue later
with our anastomosis technique.

516
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,149
The end of the donor graft has been
thoroughly cleaned from adventitia.

517
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,652
And an arteriotomy has been performed.

518
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,988
What was Dr. Choi like back in the day?

519
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,617
Even though he's a bad guy now,
he wasn't always, right?

520
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,453
Why are you so interested?

521
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,998
I just never had a teacher like him,
that's all.

522
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:22,170
There wasn't a single one who cared
about me when I think about it.

523
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,299
I can't even remember
any of their faces or names.

524
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,467
That's why I asked.

525
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,763
You were always a smart kid
with good grades and stuff, weren't you?

526
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,766
So I bet that all your teachers loved you.

527
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,518
Do you really think that?

528
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,063
I was always calling them out
on their mistakes.

529
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,110
Yeongju.

530
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,947
You don't know me all that well,

531
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,532
yet you understand.

532
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,662
What are you saying? Understand what?

533
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,748
-Who could ever understand you?
-Then what are you still doing here?

534
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,795
It's not 'cause I understand you,
but it's 'cause I actually don't.

535
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,298
You're a mystery right now.

536
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,509
I think that
if I stick around long enough,

537
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,261
then one day
I might be able to figure you out.

538
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,350
And anyhow, it's not like
you have me all figured out either.

539
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,143
-Are you kidding?
-Do you?

540
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:20,937
You're really dumb.

541
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,772
You're way too easy to read.

542
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,317
That's true.

543
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,657
Hey.

544
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,617
Here.

545
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,661
Stay in the car.

546
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,879
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah. Come this way.

547
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,297
Okay.

548
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,811
OPERATING ROOM, ORTHOPEDICS

549
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,652
All right.

550
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,407
We've only gotten to use this Operating
Room twice since the clinic opened.

551
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,118
We don't even have a surgeon here
anymore, so…

552
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:22,498
As you can see,
basically we're using it as storage now.

553
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,666
Mmm.

554
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,127
What do you think?

555
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,172
Yeah. It's more than we can ask for.

556
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,049
I think we'll take it.

557
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,842
Okay then.

558
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,846
You can use it from 10:00 at night
to 6:00 in the morning.

559
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:41,017
But I need you to clean everything up
and be out by 6:00.

560
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,687
Okay. I think
we'll need to clean it out a little.

561
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,483
Sure you can do all that…
what, the night before or whatever.

562
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,028
Just lock the door. And quietly do
whatever it is you need to.

563
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,447
Just make sure you're out
before opening hours.

564
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,616
Are we clear on that?

565
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,576
-Yes.
-All right, understood.

566
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,660
This isn't a lot, but…

567
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,331
It's a favor for Dr. Han.
So the money isn't an issue.

568
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,251
It's okay.

569
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,504
Well, if you're sure…

570
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,798
I appreciate it.

571
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,509
Mr. Yeongju Seo?

572
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,928
Yeah, that's right. Uh…

573
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,097
Do I know you?

574
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,652
All right. Feel free to look around.

575
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,778
-Okay.
-Thanks.

576
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,745
We're going to be cutting it
kind of close.

577
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,539
We'll just have to make it work.

578
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,757
Yeah?

579
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,054
Who'd you say you were?

580
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,894
What were you doing there?

581
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,149
Uh… Just killing some time.

582
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,236
Is that illegal?

583
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,294
ATTEMPTED MURDER
DEFENDANT: JEONG SEOK

584
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,588
…VICTIM ENTERED OPERATING ROOM
TO STOP SURGERY

585
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,549
SHE SNATCHED AN IV DRIP LINE,
WRAPPED IT AROUND VICTIM'S NECK,

586
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,801
AND ATTEMPTED TO STRANGLE HIM

587
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,011
What were you thinking,
strangling your teacher?

588
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,932
If Deokhee Choi had been more forgiving

589
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,725
and dropped the charges on you,

590
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,814
you'd have your career, be working as a
doctor right now and having a great life.

591
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,281
It's got to feel bad still,
and unfair too.

592
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,371
-Am I a suspect or something?
-Of course not.

593
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,750
I just think you have a good reason
to hate Deokhee Choi,

594
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,919
at least from everything I've read.

595
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,673
I get it, I really do. That's all.

596
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,092
That's what this is.

597
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,849
You've been stalking him.

598
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,560
Haven't you?

599
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,813
You were at Gwanggyo the other day
giving him shit.

600
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,151
And here too.

601
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,946
You were there
because that's where he was,

602
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,325
because of this bastard.

603
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:12,496
Right? And all the awful things that
he did to you.

604
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,333
He put you through all that hell.

605
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,043
Put me through hell?

606
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,468
I want you to teach me everything please.

607
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,928
Everything you've ever learned!

608
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,847
Every surgical skill in your head!

609
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,517
Don't keep anything to yourself.
Don't hold anything back from me.

610
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,436
Please teach me everything.

611
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,856
And why would I do that?

612
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,441
Doctor.

613
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,277
I have staked

614
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,530
my entire life on this.

615
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,118
I… I swear
I'll lay everything on the line.

616
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,787
Every single thing I've got!

617
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,416
So teach me everything that you know.
I wanna know it all too!

618
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,419
'Cause I wanna be the best
just like you, Doctor.

619
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,630
And to die in the OR is my only dream!

620
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,258
If it's not in there,
I refuse to die anywhere else.

621
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,095
So that's why
I need everything you've got,

622
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,679
down to the last detail.

623
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,849
You want everything I know, do you?

624
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,437
-Yeah.
-Okay then. In return what do I get?

625
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,233
Nothing at all.

626
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,735
I'm only here to take.

627
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,219
You're his weakness, his Achilles' heel.

628
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:57,810
Why would Deokhee Choi start doing
black-market surgery out of nowhere?

629
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,186
For what reason?

630
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,274
But you didn't have nearly
as many options, did you?

631
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,153
So the doctor that Min was going
to turn into us that day…

632
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,615
it was you. You were that doctor.

633
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,580
Jeez. What are you even saying?

634
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,040
I'm saying you're the reason that
Deokhee's a killer,

635
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,043
the reason he killed Min.

636
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,754
Don't you understand?

637
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,426
You can say that all you want,
but that's crazy.

638
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,386
Come on.

639
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,556
Wait. I thought I was his stalker,
wasn't I?

640
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:42,480
If you really were his stalker,
then at Gwanggyo temple,

641
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,565
he wouldn't have just let you go
like that.

642
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,484
Or do you think I'm blind?

643
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,277
I've known him my whole life.

644
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,532
And so, as busy as he was,
he still made time for you, right?

645
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,745
-Don't you understand what that means?
-Not at all.

646
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,829
What does it mean then?

647
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:03,042
See, that guy, he's not the type
to take shit from anyone.

648
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,044
Yet he puts up with you, huh?

649
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,047
It means you're his weakness.

650
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,135
People think you're a crazy piece of work.

651
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,888
I know the real truth.

652
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,932
He's the actual psycho.

653
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,644
You're just an unlucky kid
who got caught up in this.

654
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,313
You just happened to catch his eye.

655
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,073
NEUROSURGEON
DR. CHOI DEOKHEE

656
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,917
Wow.

657
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,127
What's going on in here?

658
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,756
Packing already?

659
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,969
I'll have to sooner or later.
May as well do it now.

660
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,181
Why are you in such a hurry?

661
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,310
Because time is running out for me.
I'm getting impatient.

662
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,108
Here.

663
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,199
Oh, you've already given me more
than enough though.

664
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,327
I already know you're not short on money.

665
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:22,621
Just take it.

666
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,265
Hi.

667
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,517
Have you eaten?

668
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,102
Not yet.

669
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,062
What about you?

670
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,398
Me neither.

671
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,942
Well, you should eat then.

672
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,156
You have
to start fasting tomorrow afternoon.

673
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,074
Fasting?

674
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,077
It's not up to your standards,
I can tell you that.

675
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,163
I got us an OR, though.

676
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,793
Why aren't you saying anything?

677
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,754
We're doing the surgery.

678
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,092
All right. Let's do it.

679
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,387
Make sure to get all your pre-op tests
done at the hospital before then.

680
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,472
That's not necessary.

681
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,974
I already know
what all the tests would say.

682
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,811
I'll get you tomorrow night, okay?

683
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,605
No, no. There's no need.

684
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,066
Just send me the address. I'll get there.

685
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,077
She doesn't know yet, does she?

686
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,747
Why tell her now
when it'll only make things worse?

687
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,544
I think I'd be upset
if I were in her shoes.

688
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,672
She will be.

689
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:56,965
Ohâ€¦

690
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,968
She's gonna raise all sorts of hell.

691
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,598
This is going to leave some nasty wounds,
I think.

692
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,977
-You're fine with that?
-Well, of course it's gonna hurt.

693
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,772
I'm stabbing her in the back.

694
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,693
It's not as if she's made of stone.
She will feel it.

695
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,946
What can you do, though?

696
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,657
That's just how life goes, I guess.

697
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,831
Dr. Choi.

698
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,750
Was this always the plan?

699
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,001
If I had known,

700
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,087
I would've quit.

701
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,475
If you can't do it, don't force yourself.

702
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,604
You don't have to.

703
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,985
Did Ms. Jeong say anything to you
just now?

704
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,195
Anything at all?

705
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,197
Like what?

706
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,077
She got called in for questioning
by Inspector Yang this morning.

707
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,205
-What the hell did he want with her?
-That, I can't say.

708
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,500
All I know for a fact is that
he kept her there for three whole hours.

709
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,253
I have a bad feeling.

710
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,090
I thought she sounded worn out.

711
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,636
Yang, that bastard.

712
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,017
All right, that'll be all.

713
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,562
Okay.

714
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,179
See you tomorrow.

715
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:34,706
