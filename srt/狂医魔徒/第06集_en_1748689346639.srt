00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,557
[Dr. Song] <i>Seok Jeong?</i>

2
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,268
-[sighs] She's trouble.
-[Dr. Choi] Why?

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,937
[Dr. Song] She has no money, no home.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,730
Showed up to school with only a backpack.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,856
[chuckles] And listen to this.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,692
She came to the entrance ceremony
with a social worker.

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,028
I was no different.

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,656
The head of my local community group
brought me.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,535
Yeah, well, everyone was
struggling back then.

10
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,994
Things are way better now.

11
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,040
No one was struggling in my class.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,628
They all drove Mercedes.
Their moms wore mink.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,839
Well. She's still nothing like you.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,469
Anyway, she's got some
serious mental health issues. Mmm.

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,930
What do you mean?

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,765
When I first saw her
at the entrance ceremony…

17
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,849
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

18
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,019
I thought, "She's a smart kid in need,
so I'll try to help out."

19
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,230
[chuckles] She started
becoming very demanding.

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,941
Used getting into school
with a top score to her advantage.

21
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,735
The alumni association
gave her a scholarship and grants.

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,488
Her freshman year,
I bought her new clothes each season.

23
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,324
Wasn't that the understanding
you two had when you poached her?

24
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,576
-From Daeseo U?
-[sighs]

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,246
Well, sure it was.
But she can't have it all.

26
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,041
So if you look at the cross-section,
is it any more clear?

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,002
-[students] Yes.
-Seok Jeong. Are you here?

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,337
-Uh, what…
-Seok Jeong!

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,089
Uh, excuse me. Who are you?

30
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,508
[stammers] We're in the middle of a class!

31
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,137
[Dr. Song] <i>While I was teaching,</i>
<i>some men burst in looking for her.</i>

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,388
<i>Do you know what she'd done?</i>

33
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>The nutcase, she decided</i>
<i>to borrow money from loan sharks.</i>

34
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,061
What's wrong with you?
Get a part-time job if you need money.

35
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,355
I don't have time
for something like that, though.

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,774
-Huh?
-I only have time to study.

37
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,235
I wanna learn absolutely everything.

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,698
Here it is. Seok Jeong's
residency application.

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,367
If you wanna know why
I absolutely can't stand that girl,

40
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,036
just read that and you'll understand.

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,120
[scoffs]

42
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,542
[sighs]

43
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,438
[phone buzzing]

44
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,780
Mr. Min.

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
What?

46
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,331
No, I'm listening. Please go on.

47
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,515
HYPER KNIFE

48
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,191
[horn blowing]

49
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,891
All right, for security reasons, I need
you all to hand over your phones, please.

50
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,270
[sighs]

51
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,084
Hey, come on.
What's with that scowl on your face?

52
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,211
Are you still pissed off or something?

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
Are you kidding?

54
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,966
You couldn't have gotten anyone else?

55
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,092
-Dr. Jeong.
-[sighs] Ms. Seok.

56
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,887
You had to pick him of all people.
Tell me why!

57
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,348
Will you please just calm down a bit?

58
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,976
It's not like I'm the one who asked
for him, it was the patient.

59
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,770
He said he wouldn't have the surgery

60
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,314
-unless I got him the best surgeon.
-What?

61
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,899
[sighs]

62
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,109
That's Dr. Choi.

63
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:41,156
And you? You're not the lead
on this operation, so simmer down.

64
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,657
Okay?

65
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,502
[sighs]

66
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,128
[keys jangle]

67
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,970
[sighs]

68
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,438
[sighs]

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,027
[knocks on door]

70
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,155
[door opens]

71
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,703
[door closes]

72
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,144
Whoa! Incredible.

73
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,900
No way. They even have
a portable CAT scan.

74
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,737
You still don't know
who the patient is, do you?

75
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,282
No idea, but I'm guessing he's loaded.

76
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,784
Why?

77
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,622
No reason.
We should start prepping things.

78
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,471
This is the first time I've ever seen
Ms. Seok not be the lead surgeon.

79
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,430
I'm worried.

80
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,683
There is no reason to worry.
Dr. Choi is excellent.

81
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,937
I know he's really good.
He was Ms. Seok's professor.

82
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,107
I'm not worried about him.
She's the one I'm scared about.

83
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,318
She might flip out on him.

84
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,490
-Dr. Jeong still holds a grudge?
-You have no idea.

85
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,951
She's just… [sighs]

86
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,596
[sighs]

87
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,348
RONDA

88
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,888
Oh.

89
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,685
Let's go.

90
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,895
Yeah.

91
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,973
[Dr. Choi sighs]

92
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,893
Min told you, right?

93
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,187
That I'm the lead surgeon?

94
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,857
You can enter
through the sinus endoscopically.

95
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,864
Why did you come here?

96
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,493
It's not like you need
the money or anything.

97
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,580
Given how full of yourself
you are these days,

98
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
I was a little curious.

99
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,795
I thought I might as well see it
firsthand, your criminal lifestyle.

100
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,924
[scoffs]

101
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,218
What are you talking about?

102
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,638
Are you still angry about the dogs?

103
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,100
I told you the authorities were onto you.

104
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:04,104
That was a careless mistake you made.
That's why I took care of your mess.

105
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,855
So be grateful.

106
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,863
I could've hidden them all away
somewhere, you know.

107
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,618
But you burned them alive.

108
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
It was just a few dogs.

109
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,834
Get over it.

110
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,671

-Dr. Jeong! Please stop!
-[Seok] Let go!

119
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,823

-Let go! [panting]

[shouts, panting]

122
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,498
Dr. Choi.

123
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,916
My goodness.

124
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,422
Are you okay?

125
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,639
[Seo] Ms. Seok.

126
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,766
Ms. Seok!

127
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,643
[exhales deeply]

128
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,730
You can't beat him up. The man has cancer.

129
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,569
Come on. Let's just talk about it, okay?

130
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656

[Seo] Come on,
will you please just open the door?

136
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,797
I'm really worried about you!

137

[knocks on door]

139
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,640
Ms. Seok. Why don't you
just come out here and talk?

140
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,018
What the hell is going on? Huh?
Did she beat up Choi?

141
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,895
No, she didn't really exactly…

142
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,522
-Yeah, she sure did.
-[sighs]

143
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,901
The guy's doing surgery tomorrow.
Why's she beating him up?

144
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,236
How should I know?

145
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,363
-I didn't think she should've.
-[sighs]

-[door knob jiggling]
-[knocking on door]

147

[Min] Jeong.

148
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,117
Jeong, open the door.

149
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,285
Hey, Jeong!

150
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,996
Ah, shit.

151
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,543
Hey. You need to keep her
under control, huh?

152
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,631
If she botches this operation,
then no one's getting off this ship alive.

153
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,591
All of us will be finished.

154
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,011
Who are we operating on? Some criminal?

155
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,056
[scoffs] If only it were that simple.

156
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,225
If not that, then who?

157
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,272
God.

158
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,617
[groans]

159
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,540
I don't get why someone like you
is willing to work with Seok Jeong.

160
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,334
Look at what she did here, huh?

161
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,045
She clearly has severe mental issues.

162
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,298
I've never thought of her
as being unstable.

163
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,924
[chuckles]

164
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,093
That's only because
you don't really know her.

165
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
You could be the grown-up
in this situation.

166
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,139
Stop bullying her and leave her alone.

167
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,850
Hey, I was just assaulted.

168
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,184
But I should stop bullying her?

169
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,769
[Dr. Han sighs]

170
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,857
[inhales sharply]
I showed a friend your CT scans.

171
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,984
Seongtae Kwak at Daeseo Hospital.

172
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
I told him it was my cousin
and needed his help.

173
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,031
I never asked you to do that.

174
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,907
You should let Dr. Kwak operate on you.

175
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,452
He's more than capable of doing the job.

176
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,205
Seongtae Kwak.
I've heard of him. He's not bad.

177
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,499
But the best? That he isn't.

178
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,461
-Is Dr. Jeong truly the best?
-I made her that way.

179
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,589
So, yes. I instructed her. I trained her.

180
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,342
Every skill she displays
in the operating room,

181
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,680
all of it, every bit of knowledge
in her head, came from me.

182
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,350
And I'm bullying her? I'm not, actually.

183
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,353
She owes me everything
and insists on not repaying me.

184
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,564
The people that you teach
don't owe you anything.

185
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,153
[sighs]

186
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,578
You know what?
I'd like to get some rest now.

187
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,538
[smacks lips, sighs]

188
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,499
[Dr. Choi sighs]

189
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,183
[Dr. Song] <i>Look at it.</i>
<i>This thing is a ticking time bomb.</i>

190
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,352
You should page Dr. Choi.

191
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,771
Actually, Dr. Choi's taking time off.

192
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,607
Is he? Who'll do it? Should I?

193
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,862
-I'll do it.
-Very good, then.

194
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,202
Choi is taking time off? What's going on?

195
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,454
It's personal. That's all anyone knows.

196
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,874
Wait, what kind of personal reasons
could he have?

197
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,960
It's not like he has a family
to take care of.

198
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,211
No idea.

199
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,588
-[scoffs] If you don't know, who does?
-Why do you care?

200
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,016
-[passenger] Oh, yes. There you are!
-Hi!

201
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,769
-Good to see you! You're finally here!
-Oh, good to see you too!

202
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,941
Alan Kim, if I'm not mistaken?

203
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,945
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

204
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,708
-For you.
-Oh.

205
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,627
If there's anything you need
or somewhere you want to go,

206
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,047
please reach out to me or Mr. Kim.
He's the butler here and happy to help.

207
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,635
So, uh, can I speak to Dr. Choi directly
or is that not possible?

208
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,097
Unfortunately, he can't answer his phone
where he is right now.

209
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,058
He told me to tell you,
"I'm sorry I can't greet you.

210
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,187
No need to be polite. My home is yours."

211
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,316
[inhales, exhales]

212
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,276
[groans]

213
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,663
Ugh, that little…

214
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,767
Hey there, Dr. Jeong,
did you get something to eat? Huh?

215
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,312
[sighs, scoffs]

216
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,490
[sighs]

217
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,414
Yeah, so, um, he's, uh…

218
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,375
Yeah, yeah. Good luck.

219
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,925
Hello, sir. I'm Deokhee Choi.

220
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,718
Oh, Dr. Choi. [chuckles]

221
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,846
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

222
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,265
Wait. What happened to your face?

223
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,935
It's nothing. A dispute, that's all.

224
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,311
[laughs]

225
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,772
Oh, you're still throwing punches
at your age?

226
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,315
Guess you're young at heart, huh?

227
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,900
Oh, have some.

228
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,653
As you know, the patient can't eat,
but the doctor should.

229
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,737
Right.

230
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,829
Hey, c-can I have one sip? M-m-maybe?

231
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
[chuckles]

232
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,383
[patient sighs]

233
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,221
[sighs]
The surgery is this evening, right?

234
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,931
Yes.

235
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,892
[breathes deeply]
It could be the very last day I get

236
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,894
to spend among the living, I guess.

237
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:29,734
I might die in the OR.
Could be that's how it ends.

238
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,865
[sighs] That view.
I should enjoy it while I can.

239
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,869
Save my life. You have no choice.

240
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
Got it?

241
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,455
You're gonna live forever anyway.

242
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,334
-You've got no reason to worry.
-[chuckles]

243
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,377
Well, that's what
all my followers believe.

244
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,505
That's why I can't even go
to the hospital when I have cancer,

245
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,883
and I'm doing this with you
in the middle of the ocean.

246
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,596
Looking back on it all,

247
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,891
I believe I've had a pretty good life,
doing whatever I wanted.

248
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,519
But now that death has
caught up to me, maybe not.

249
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,649
Do you believe in God?

250
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,359
Not really.

251
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,071
Someone at your age,
you gotta believe in something, you know?

252
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,493
Well, you could always join us.
Never too late. [laughs]

253
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,245
[grunts]

254
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,965
Miss Seok. Hot stuff fresh from the oven.

255
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,595
[sniffs] Mmm! It smells so good.
Wanna split this one?

256
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,013
No, you can have it all.

257
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,725
Have you seen Dr. Choi anywhere?

258
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,435
No, I haven't. Why?

259
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,689
I was just wondering how he was doing.

260
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,858
If he was okay.
Those injuries looked like they hurt.

261
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,156
Well, sorry. I don't really
feel like talking about that.

262
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,621
All right. We can talk about it
at a later time if you want to.

263
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,208
[door opens, closes]

264
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,001
Ah, I'm good, I'm good.

265
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,715
[sighs] You know, you shouldn't
have beaten him up like that.

266
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,342
The man is your teacher after all. Right?

267
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,512
You totally messed up his face.
What are you going to do, huh?

268
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,933
I heard that the surgery starts at night.
Why are we doing it so late?

269
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,185
Because night is when
our patient wants it done.

270
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,772
[sighs] That forces us
to stay up til morning though.

271
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,358
Well, that's what the client
wants us to do, okay?

272
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,944
He wants to feel like he's going to sleep
when you put him under.

273
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,488
He's the one in charge
so take it up with him.

274
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,074
Pretty demanding
for a guy getting black market surgery.

275
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,287
It's not like we have a choice.
We have to honor his wishes. Don't we?

276
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,790
Hey, Han, tell me. Am I wrong here?

277
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,129
Thanks for the assist.

278
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,301
[grunts]
All right, you should all eat something

279
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,471
and rest up while you still can, okay?

280
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,514
I'll call you
when it's time for the surgery.

281
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,684
Enjoy.

282
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,186
-Yongryeol.
-Yes, sir.

283
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,818
[scoffs] Since when has he ever
cared about the patient's wishes?

284
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,738
When Euntae Kim is the patient, he does.

285
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,868
-Euntae Kim?
-The cult leader?

286
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,629
[whispers] Ah, shit.

287
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,888
It's incredible.
How the heck can he afford this?

288
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,307
His cult has over 200,000 followers.

289
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,062
That's a lot of weirdos. Who knew?

290
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,690
[groans] Min really screwed us over.

291
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,110
Okay, look, I'm really worried here.

292
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,987
This is my first time assisting,

293
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,949
and I feel like if I mess up,
they'll literally kill me.

294
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,033
It's all right.

295
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,536
Just remember what you learned
in class, okay? Hmm?

296
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,164
Dr. Han, can we talk for a minute?

297
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,137
It's Dr. Choi.
He's having trouble with his hands.

298
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,139
I thought I should let you know.

299
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,519
Oh, yeah.

300
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,312
I've got the endoscopy to handle.

301
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,275
So I need you to do me a favor.
Keep an eye on him.

302
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,111
It's bound to be an issue
during the surgery.

303
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,655
But if it was that bad,
he would've said something.

304
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,657
He would have stepped away
from doing the procedure.

305
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,075
With an ego like his?

306
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,786
He only ever cares about himself.

307
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,330
[sighs]

308
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,798
[driver]
Why are you headed there at this hour?

309
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,176
It's supposed to be
a great eel restaurant.

310
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm meeting someone for a drink.

311
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,265
I think that place closed down
a while ago.

312
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,975
Did they reopen?

313
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,267
[scoffs] He was right.

314
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,062
[sighs]

315
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,566
-[phone dialing]
-[car approaching]

316
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,119
[police chief] <i>What was he doing</i>
<i>all the way out there?</i>

317
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,123
What we've gathered so far is that he was
gonna meet someone but we don't know who.

318
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,875
[police chief] He's been missing
for two weeks now,

319
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,377
and there's still no sign of him.

320
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,087
What are you going to do, huh?

321
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,215
Are you going to sit around
until his body turns up?

322
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,468
A fellow officer has gone missing
in the middle of a case!

323
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,678
What's your plan here?

324
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,929
Well, we have one theory.

325
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,181
[sighs] Lee had discovered
something important,

326
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:38,227
and the culprit kidnapped him to stop him
and slow the investigation, I think.

327
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,187
-Maybe.
-I agree with that theory.

328
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,563
Then find them already.

329
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,233
It sounds like you don't have
any leads yet.

330
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,235
Are you that incompetent?

331
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,364
-No, sir. I'll find Min.
-You said you lost him.

332
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,493
If you can't handle this, let Seong
take over and get the fuck off the case.

333
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,248
Just give me a week, please.

334
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,379
-[crew member] Thank you, sir.
-[boss] All right.

335
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,881
[crew member] See you later.

336
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:08,966
[boss grunts]

337
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,094
-[crew member 2] See you later, Boss.
-[sighs]

338
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,063
Mr. Pyo,
we're Special Investigations Unit.

339
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,984
[Pyo sighs]

340
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,266
Let's get you in the operating room.

341
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,811
All right.

342
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
This way, please.

343
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,395
[door opens]

344
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:32,818
[Euntae sighs]

345
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,071
[Min clears throat]

346
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,283
This is the anesthesiologist,
Dr. Hyeonho Han.

347
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,996
And this young lady is Dr. Choi's
finest student, Dr. Seok Jeong.

348
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,665
Hey, I knew it was a lady doctor.

349
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,251
What I didn't know was
that she was just a kid.

350
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,711
[chuckles]

351
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,170
Aw.

352
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,506
I knew you had to be old,

353
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,092
-but I didn't know you were this old.
-[sighs]

354
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,387
You look like you're over a hundred.
Are you sure you want to do this?

355
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,764
-[inhales sharply]
-[chuckles] The kid's got some nerve.

356
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,726
-And I'm tired too, Grandpa.
-I don't care.

357
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,771
What are you going to do in my head?
Explain it to me.

358
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,732
-Well, Dr. Jeong and I are going to--
-No.

359
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,233
Choi, not you.

360
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,319
-You.
-[sighs]

361
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,155
[sighs]

362
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,994
-This is your brain here.
-Mmm.

363
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,621
This is your tumor.

364
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,039
-You see it?
-Mm-hmm.

365
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,499
Given its shape,
it's very difficult to remove.

366
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,793
So Dr. Choi will approach it from up here,

367
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,963
and I'll access it endoscopically
through your sinus here.

368
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,007
In other words,
we're removing it from both sides.

369
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,635
-Mm-hmm.
-But based on what we see here,

370
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,095
there's a very strong chance
the tumor has hardened.

371
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,474
So we're gonna remove it
by breaking it up.

372
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,769
Are you getting all that?

373
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,229
-Mmm. Mmm.
-[scoffs]

374
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,025
[sighs]

375
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,360
[sighs]

376
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,244
What?

377
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,542
During surgery,
if you think you can't finish…

378
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,170
I don't think that'll happen.

379
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,255
Your hands are shaky.

380
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,094
We can switch positions
if something happens in there, okay?

381
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,054
So don't be a stubborn old man.

382
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,348
[Dr. Choi inhales sharply]

383
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,808
I'm getting changed.

384
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,685
You gonna watch?

385
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:37,818
[sighs]

386
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,320
[♪ tense music playing]

387
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,406
[apparatus whirring]

388
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,389
That's not enough.
You need to remove more.

389
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,307
Well, that's what you think.

390
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,311
If you've got a problem with
what I'm thinking, then let me rephrase.

391
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,647
Do as you're told. Remove more.

392
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,527
[sighs]

393
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,698
Yes, that's better.

394
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,330
I'll be assisting you today, Dr. Choi.

395
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,041
Okay, let's go.

396
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,920
[♪ tense music playing]

397
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:11,787
[detective] Inguk Pyo, please be advised
that this interview is being recorded.

398
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,625
[papers rustling]

399
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,377
[inhales sharply]

400
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,673
Should I call you Captain or something?
You own at least ten boats.

401
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,469
Money's not an issue for you,

402
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,765
so why'd you get into smuggling instead
of just fishing for squids or something?

403
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,683
[sighs]

404
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,022
[Yang] The organ trafficker Hyeonju Min.

405
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,733
Smuggling him into China.
That's what you were trying to do.

406
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,277
I have no idea who this Min guy is,

407
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,988
-and I've never done that.
-[sighs]

408
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,076
Your navigator told us
it was your idea to call it off.

409
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,745
You learned that day
the coast guard was on patrol.

410
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,082
I thought we had an understanding here.

411
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,292
I'm the one who gave you Min's number.

412
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,670
[coughs, clears throat]

413
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,257
[button clicks]

414
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,261
[inhales sharply] Yes, you did,

415
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,472
-and now he's off the grid again.
-What do you expect me to do?

416
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,185
A detective is missing right now.

417
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,021
Please believe we take this seriously.

418
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,898
Tell me where he is.

419
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,483
[sighs]

420
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,196
[inhales deeply, sighs]

421
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,698
[Min] <i>Oh, hi.</i>

422
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,784
Funny, I've been meaning
to give you a call actually. [chuckles]

423
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,787
How's it going?

424
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,038
Oh, you know.

425
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,750
I have been feeling kinda stuck,
like life was one big fog,

426
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,377
but things turn around, yeah?

427
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,131
Found a few new scores,
new connections too. [chuckles]

430
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,095
Min, it's Yang here.

431
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,643
Ah, Inspector Yang, huh?

432
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,728
[chuckles]

433
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,063
Hey… [clears throat] …sorry,
can't really talk right now.

434
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,440
Got a few things cooking.

435
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,778
If you hang up on me, I'm gonna assume
you killed Detective Wanil Lee.

436
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,906
[sighs]

437
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,826
[vacuum drain sucking]

442
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,559
Do you wanna switch positions?

443
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,107
[inhales sharply]
Just keep doing what you're doing.

444
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,692
[sighs]

445
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,279
[exhales sharply]

00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,450

[suction continues]

448
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,466
[Seok] Through-cut forceps.

449
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,652
Will you focus?

450
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,825
[sighs]

451
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,663
[Dr. Choi] What's on your mind?

452
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,167
[Seok] Nothing's on my mind, Doctor.
Just keep working.

453
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:51,339
[Dr. Choi] As I recall, your
first operation as a lead surgeon was--

454
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,549
Absolutely perfect.

455
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,260
[Dr. Choi]
Oh, is that how you remember it?

456
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,347
You're so self-absorbed.
That's why no one likes you.

457
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,934
Dr. Han, let me ask you.
What do you think her problem is?

458
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,730
I have to say, I've never heard you
talk so much, Dr. Choi.

459
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,402
[Dr. Choi] She's dangerously impulsive,
completely selfish,

460
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,155
and ungrateful as well. [scoffs]

461
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,242
And who exactly
am I supposed to be grateful to?

462
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,661
So, you're not grateful to me at all.

463
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,497
I'm grateful to you.

464
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,004
You didn't know that, did you? Hmm?

465
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,505
[inhales sharply]

466
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,758
Those times when we worked together were

467
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,510
the most exciting and fulfilling
moments of my life.

468
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,180
So of course I'm grateful to you.

469
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,558
Very much so. I hope you believe that.

470
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,563
[inhales sharply] I never realized
that teaching could be so exciting,

471
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,024
until you came along.

472
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,611
I didn't even think it was possible.

473
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,196
[chuckles]

474
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,496
Ah, I see it.

475
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,837
[chuckles] That you?

476
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,964
[sighs, chuckles]

477
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,072
[sighs]

478
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,617
[exhales deeply]

479
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,723
[door closes]

480
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,143
[panting]

481
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,904
[inhales deeply] Why are you here?

482
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,113
You should go rest.

483
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,493
You seem to be in a good mood.

484
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,872
Hmm, first time in a while. [chuckles]

485
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,466
[inhales sharply]
If you have something to say, just say it.

486
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,552
It's no secret you hate me.

487
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,597
I don't hate you.

488
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,266
It's the other way around.

489
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,361
Back then…

490
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,031
working with you at the hospital…

491
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,576
I felt the same way.

492
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,080
It was the happiest time in my life.

493
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,585
I really loved working there.

494
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,254
More than anything.

495
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,884
But thinking back on all those days now…

496
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,221
it feels like torture.

497
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,893
All of it's in the past. It's a bit sad.

498
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,689
[sighs]

499
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,773
I know.

500
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,033
This was it.

501
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,036
Our last surgery together.

502
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,998
I'm right about that, aren't I?

503
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:41,337
If you're saying it's the last one,
then maybe it really is.

504
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:46,843
[sighs]

505
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,896
Thank you for everything.

506
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,732
[door closes]

507
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,489
Good to see you, Dr. Ha.

508
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,657
-Hi.
-Oh.

509
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,117
I thought Dr. Choi might be sick.

510
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,079
Sorry, but he's actually
out of town for a few days.

511
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,331
Oh, really?

512
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,417
While you're here,
why don't you have a cup of tea?

513
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,127
[chuckles] Sure, thank you.

514
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,779
So, you work with Dr. Choi
at Yeonshin University.

515
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,074
How did I not know about this?

516
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,827
Mmm.

517
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,663
So, Dr. Jeong, you know her as well?

518
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,124
Yeah, I do. How do you know Seok?

519
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,378
Well, there's this thing I was planning
on doing, and I wanna do it with her.

520
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,296
Do what with her exactly?

521
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,340
A challenge.

522
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,592
Brainstem glioma case I have.

523
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,971
The tumor has grown.
We can't operate due to that.

524
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,390
Therefore, this whole section…

525
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,814
This whole section, from here to
over here, is the area we're cutting out.

526
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,816
-It's tricky.
-Hmm.

527
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,193
[inhales sharply]

528
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,038
Hold on.

529
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,056
Dr. Han is gonna stick around to observe?

530
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,224
One of us has to stay here.

531
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,476
[sighs]

532
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,772
Yeah, but it doesn't feel right
to leave him behind on this ship.

533
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,257
[car door opens]

534
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,650
[sighs]

535
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,487
[breathes deeply, sighs]

536
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,046
-I feel bad leaving you here all alone.
-It's all right.

537
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,049
You did well. Good work, Doctor.

538
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,552
-See you later, then.
-Okay.

539
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,012
Man, there's so much to do.
I'm all over the place.

540
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,223
Han, I'll see you next week, then. Yeah?

541
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,058
-See you later, Boss.
-Yeah, see ya.

542
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,019
Dr. Choi isn't here?

543
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,272
Oh, he already left.

544
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,857
Yeah, he's long gone.

545
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,108
Let's go, hmm?

546
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,236
Come on! I made a reservation.

547
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,320
Can't be late.

548
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,161
[phone dialing]

549
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,080
[Min] Ah, hi, Dr. Choi.

550
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,457
Well… [chuckles] …sorry
we didn't even get a chance

551
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,960
to say a proper goodbye, yeah? [chuckles]

552
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,588
You know, you really helped me out
a lot back there.

553
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,881
I wanted to thank you.

554
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,799
Yeah, we should.

555
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,385
I'll take you out
for a night on the town then, on me.

556
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,553
[chuckles] Yeah.

557
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,346
[Dr. Choi] <i>All right.</i>

558
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,849
Doctor, do you know Hoirangak
at Sinpo Market?

559
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,350
We're all having dinner there later.

560
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,602
-Why don't you join us?
-No, no.

561
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,395
You must be exhausted. You should rest.

562
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,856
Next time we get together,
I'll be sure to invite you.

563
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,774
-All right, bye.
-[phone disconnects]

564
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,945
[Dr. Choi sighs]

565
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,908
[Dr. Choi sighs]

566
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,619
So, what did Min say?

567
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,538
He's going to use Seok Jeong
as leverage, you know?

568
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,541
He'll force you to perform surgery.

569
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,628
Are you okay with that?

570
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,962
[inhales sharply]

571
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,839
Do you mind a slight detour?

572
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:44,367
[sighs]

573
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,960
[Seok] <i>Dear Dr. Jinu Song.</i>

574
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,297
<i>I hope this is all just</i>
<i>a misunderstanding,</i>

575
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,633
<i>but I've heard that you strongly opposed</i>
<i>my residency</i>

576
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,301
<i>in the neurosurgery department.</i>

577
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,722
<i>You've hated me</i>
<i>for a long time now, haven't you?</i>

578
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,392
<i>I'd like to think</i>
<i>you're not so petty a person</i>

579
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,477
<i>that you can't admit to feeling that way.</i>

580
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,522
<i>You wanna know why I'm bringing this up?</i>

581
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,440
<i>To make it clear to you that I know.</i>

582
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,150
<i>I know you don't like me.</i>

583
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,235

584
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,447
[Seok] <i>Neurosurgery has always been</i>
<i>my only option.</i>

585
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:27,326
<i>I have to become a neurosurgeon,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

586
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,746
<i>You may not understand</i>
<i>how important it is to me,</i>

587
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,748
<i>or why I've dedicated my life to it,</i>

588
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,086
<i>but here's the reason why I'm applying</i>
<i>for a residency in neurosurgery.</i>

589
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,171
Sir, can you wake up?

590
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,340
Sir, are you all right?

591
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,010
Doctor!

592
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,016
-[doctor] All right, ready?
-[all] One, two, three!

593
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,518
-[paramedic] All right.
-[doctor] All right. Okay…

594
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,105
[Seok] <i>Ever since I was little,</i>
<i>my mind would never stop racing.</i>

595
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,524
<i>I was constantly thinking,</i>

596
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,776
<i>and that kept me from doing</i>
<i>anything at all.</i>

597
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,323
<i>I couldn't eat or sleep,</i>
<i>all because of my mind.</i>

598
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,283
<i>It just wouldn't stop.</i>

599
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,495
<i>No matter what I did or how hard I tried,</i>

600
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,498
<i>I couldn't get away</i>
<i>from all the thoughts in my head.</i>

601
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,251
<i>Every minute of every hour was like that,</i>

602
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,588
<i>and before I knew it,</i>
<i>the days would be over.</i>

603
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,509
<i>It felt like there were</i>
<i>these tiny explosions.</i>

604
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,596
<i>They were going off</i>
<i>in my brain every moment.</i>

605
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,349
<i>I enjoyed the feeling,</i>

606
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,226
<i>but it was actually painful.</i>

607
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,315
<i>My teachers would say I was very bright,</i>
<i>but also overly distracted.</i>

608
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,652
<i>I thought that was unfair,</i>
<i>because it wasn't my fault.</i>

609
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,573
<i>I was convinced there was</i>
<i>a tiny worm living inside my brain.</i>

610
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,034
<i>This worm was very busy,</i>

611
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,454
<i>crawling through all the wrinkles</i>
<i>and folds of my brain,</i>

612
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,373
<i>poking around,</i>

613
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,624
<i>making me think.</i>

614
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,877
<i>That's why I had headaches,</i>

615
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,130
<i>why I couldn't sleep at night,</i>
<i>why I couldn't focus on anything.</i>

616
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,387
<i>I wished I could slice open my head</i>
<i>and catch that worm in my brain.</i>

617
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,850
<i>But that was impossible.</i>

618
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,020
<i>Of course, there was nothing I could do.</i>

619
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,190

623
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,968
<i>As you know yourself,</i>

624

-[apparatus whirring]

<i>But when I walked into the operating room</i>
<i>for the very first time,</i>

627
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,859
<i>I finally saw a live human brain.</i>

628
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,112
<i>When they removed the dura mater</i>

629
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,323
<i>and revealed everything</i>
<i>that was hidden underneath it,</i>

630
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,745
<i>I felt the artistry of whoever it was</i>
<i>who had designed that maze.</i>

631
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:22,877
<i>It was an intricately woven maze</i>
<i>of winding paths,</i>

632
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,714
<i>so delicate, yet at the same time,</i>
<i>incredibly detailed.</i>

00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,888
<i>Right then,</i>
<i>my mind finally stopped racing,</i>

634
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,558

<i>I wasn't distracted.</i>

635
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,522
<i>In the operating room,</i>
<i>I was stepping into uncharted territory,</i>

<i>areas that no other human</i>
<i>had ever explored.</i>

637

We're in the same boat now, so we gotta
stick together till the end, okay?

648

We even got Dr. Choi on board.

Hey, I was looking for you just now.
Where were you?

Before we sit down,
I wanted to have a little talk.

Wait, uh, can't…
Can't we just talk over dinner?
