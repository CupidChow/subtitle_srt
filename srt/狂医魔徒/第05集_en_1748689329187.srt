Listen, all right?
Now pay attention to what I'm saying.

3
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,656
You see, I want to be on my own
without any burdens.

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,700
I wanna be free.

5
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,205
So don't worry about me, okay?

6
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,041

00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,716
I believe I'm owed an explanation here.

[sighs]

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,561
It was a while back.
You asked me for a pretty unusual favor.

12
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,813
Do you recall?

13
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,066
You wanted to buy some land
in the mountains. That's what you said.

14
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,404
Mmm. I do recall.

15
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,326
[Ms. Ra] <i>So I found you a few options,</i>

16
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,580
<i>but for some reason, you chose one</i>
<i>that was packed with wild dogs.</i>

17
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>There were so many of them, in fact,</i>

18
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,087
<i>that even the seller was at his wit's end.</i>

19
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,798
<i>He didn't know what to do.</i>

20
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,154
[sighs]

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
So then,

22
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,534
you followed me there?

23
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,623
[Ms. Ra] <i>Well, it was so strange,</i>
<i>I got curious.</i>

24
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,834
<i>I'll admit that I was torn.</i>

25
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,838
<i>But even then, I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to call the police.</i>

26
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,968
<i>So the first thing I did</i>
<i>was save his life.</i>

27
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,846
<i>Because I'm not a murderer.</i>

28
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,975
And what if he woke up
and reported it to the authorities?

29
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,019
Things didn't work out that way, did they?

30
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,982
He'd suffered so much brain damage
that he didn't even know his own name.

31
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>So I had him admitted to the hospital</i>
<i>under the name of a homeless man I knew.</i>

<i>Nothing to get upset about,</i>
<i>wouldn't you agree?</i>

36
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,599
<i>Don't worry.</i>

37
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,895

Do you think anything is gonna change?

70
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,467
I told you, this is what happened.

I'm sorry for making
you come all this way,

72
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,390
but a man died last night.

73
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,852

in a coma so he can't give his statement.

Could you tolerate someone who tried
to use your missing father to exploit you?

77
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,320
It's despicable.

78
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,700
That guy, he was stringing Kiyoung along
and lying to his face to get the reward.

How many times do I have to say it?

Stop calling. It's getting annoying.

Yeah.

If he dies, the blood will be

He ended up like that 'cause you were

You haven't learned.

That's how I understand it.

Slower by the day.

We're in the same boat, aren't we?

To not get caught by the police…

101
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,793
I would have to operate on you.

No one else knows the truth.

You don't have to worry about

-I got his call log.
-[Dr. Choi sighs]

176
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,448
You were the last person he called.

177
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,788
Really?

178
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,125
<i>We were supposed to meet up,</i>
<i>but I couldn't make it.</i>

179
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,459
<i>I wasn't feeling so well.</i>

180
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,920
[Yang] <i>Why didn't you mention it to me?</i>

181
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,631
[Dr. Choi]
<i>He said he had something to tell me.</i>

182
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,383
<i>And it needed to be private.</i>

183
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm a suspect now, is that it?

184
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,972
No, that's not it.

185
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,349
We just gotta investigate it.

186
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,020
Actually, we were getting together
because of you.

187
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,690
He said that you were taking bribes.

188
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,026
[laughs]

189
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,487
Wanil, that crazy bastard.

190
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,535
-Why would he talk to you though?
-I don't know.

191
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,539
I was going to tell you about it
after listening to what he had to say.

192
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,921
So then, if I may… [chuckles]

193
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,175
You never met Wanil that night.
Is that right?

194
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:08,968
You mind if I check?

195
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,221
Even if I said I minded,
you would still do it.

196
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,727
[phone ringing]

197
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,939
One minute.

198
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,034
[groans]

199
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Yeah.

[detective]
<i>I'm at Dr. Choi's residence right now.</i>

201
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,749
I've checked the security camera footage

202
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,001
and also just talked to his butler here.

203
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,130
It looks like he went to bed early
immediately after he came home from work.

204
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,924
Yes.

205
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,482
So you're here alone today?

206
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,192
[chuckles] Yeah.

207
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,950
Look at you.
You look like you're on top of the world.

208
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,743
Did your brother leave for good?

209
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,123
Yeah. He was always telling everyone he
wanted to go to Seoul, and then he left.

210
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,708
I'm glad to hear he's gone.

211
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,088
By the way,
when will the pharmacy open again?

212
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,383
Oh, next month.

213
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,136
I haven't seen Ms. Jeong for a while.
She hasn't even been here to eat.

214
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,680
Is she under the weather?

215
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,516
Yeah, I guess she's been feeling sick.

216
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,769
She doesn't seem to want to eat anything.

217
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,902
[Dr. Choi] <i>The police found some dog hair</i>
<i>on the nurse's clothes.</i>

218
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,821
They found dog hair, you guys.

219
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,910
What are we gonna do? What do you think?

220
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,291
My hands… They're getting
slower and slower by the day.

221
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,212
[sighs]

222
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,173
[vehicle approaches]

223
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,934
You aren't out hunting boars tonight?

224
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,479
What are you doing here so late?

225
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,398
Wow, the air's so nice here.

226
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,657
Seo's really worried so that's why
I came over here to check up on you.

227
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,952
[chuckles] Oh, for the love of…

228
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,830
[sighs] What's his deal? He's so annoying.

229
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,374
What has he been babbling about?

230
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,753
He's worried that you're feeling down.

231
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,674
We haven't had any surgeries lately.
You can't deny that.

232
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,891
Things aren't looking good.
So what should we do?

233
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,695
Honestly, at times like this,

234
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,866
I wanna run away and go be locked up.

235
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,327
Locked up? Really?

236
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,080
Yeah, like in a jail.

237
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,459
A jail with only surgery.

238
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,339
I'd wake up every morning
and spend the day in the OR.

239
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,426
And after I was done, I'd have dinner.

240
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,888
Then go to sleep.

241
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,852
Day in, day out, day in.

242
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,106
Nothing but operating.

243
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,858
[chuckles]

244
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,237
I'd give anything for that kind of life.

245
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,241
I wouldn't have to do anything else ever.

246
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,996
No worries. I'd have everything I'd need.

247
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,585
[sighs]

248
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,131
A life sentence hopefully.

249
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,135
You have to know that Seo and I both
would follow you.

250
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,804
Willingly. Life sentence and all.

251
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,227
However, our reasons for going
would be different.

252
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,063
I would agree to go as a doctor.

253
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,442
That's the road
that I have chosen to follow.

254
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,945
And ultimately, you and I
are heading in the same direction.

255
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,908
But Seo, he would go there
just to follow you.

256
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,704
He'd be loyal to the very end.
No questions asked.

257
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,417
Do you see the difference?

258
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,211
That's Seo.

259
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,089
That young man has a kind heart.

260
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,842
He cares for you.

261
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,980
[sighs]

262
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,319
I brought some painkillers,
but I'm not sure if this will be enough.

263
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,071
Did you eat today?

264
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,366
[sighs]

265
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,458
[sighs]
Your clothes are drenched in sweat.

266
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,876
You'd better go change now.

267
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,671
Dr. Jeong, could you hand me
his pajamas back there?

268
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,516
Thanks.

269
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
Oh, right. Sorry.

270
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,815
That's Dr. Seok Jeong.
She'll be coming by from time to time.

271
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,117
[Seok] You ever had a job before?

272
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:14,208
Associate, chief, manager…
Which one do you like?

273
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,296
I think I like manager actually.

274
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,799
Yeah, let's go with that.

275
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,345
You know what I like most about you?

276
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,473
I heard you don't have any parents.

277
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,767
[giggles]

278
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,438
I used to work at a hospital
but now I'm in pharmacy school.

279
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,692
I'll get my own soon.

280
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,360
Some adorable dogs too.

281
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,531
So this big boy, this tumor here…

282
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,743
It's growing from your skull,
and when it gets bigger like yours did,

283
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,162
it gives you a huge lump like that.

284
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,917
The one inside your head right now,
that one's malignant.

285
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,211
It's a messed-up one.

286
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,964
I don't want surgery. I told you.

287
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,843
Why? Is it money?

288
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,679
We already said we'd do it for free.

289
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,933
Geez.

290
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,274
[panting]

291
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,656
Hey.

292
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,369
You're actually tired of living.
Is that it?

293
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,706
You just want to die peacefully
in your bed.

294
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,376
Did I nail it?

295
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,962
[chuckles]

296
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,050
But it isn't gonna be all that peaceful.

297
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,887
You haven't felt anything bad yet.

298
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,890
Soon, no amount of painkillers will help.

299
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,643
The lump will only get bigger,

300
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,228
and you'll have all these
splitting headaches every day.

301
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,855
[chuckles]

302
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,024
Not to mention the vomiting.

303
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,734
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

304
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,653
So what should I do then?

305
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,077
If you go out like this,

306
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,413
it'll be a slow death,
so you'll be in pain for a long while.

307
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,337
Now, if you die during surgery,
it's all over in a second.

308
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:29,134
We put you to sleep,
and then you just don't wake up.

309
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,095
That's it.

310
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,639
Could you imagine?

311
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,641
How easy is that?

312
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:40,104
I mean, you wanted to die peacefully.
It's better this way.

313
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,900
[chuckles]

314
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,610
I'll take care of it, okay?

315

318
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,330
Of course.

-Okay.

I want my thanks.

323

Why don't you sing me something?

324
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,631
Where's my song?

325
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,346
-Let's hear it.
-[Seok chuckles]

326
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,807

Hey, it looks like all the classes
are letting out.

351
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,072
Why aren't you coming down?

352
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,867
<i>You're at the academy? Why?</i>

353
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,119
Thought we could get dinner together.

354
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,919
I'm going to the movies
with some friends from class.

355
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,587
<i>Movies?</i>

356
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,632
Yeah, that's right.
We're about to go in now.

357
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,966
[metal clangs]

358
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,721
I can't talk anymore, okay?

359
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,806
[line clicks]

360
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,186
Knowing her, she'll keep calling.

361
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:54,066
You should probably just turn it off.
She can be pretty obsessive about things.

362
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,570
Hey, let's get this over with.

363
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,614
You killed her, right?

364
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,660
-No, I didn't.
-Then who did?

365
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,956
-Was it your boss?
-Ms. Seok is a doctor.

366
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,250
Why would a doctor kill someone? [gasps]

367
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,836
She's not just a doctor though, is she?

368
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,421
[whimpering]

369
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,590
Why are you doing this? It wasn't me.

370
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,552
Hey. There were only three of you
there that day,

371
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,721
and my guy said he didn't do it.

372
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,556
So it's got to be one of you two.

373
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,309
You wanna keep stringing me along
like this…

374
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,396
or should I just call your boss myself?

375
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,481
[breathing heavily]

376
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,281
-Hello. How are you?
-Can I get a combo, please?

377
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,158
Here you go.

378
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,758
[line ringing]

379
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,316
She's here to watch a movie.

380
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,193
[sighs]

381
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,364
When's the last time you've gone out?

382
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,593
We'll need meat, won't we?

383
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,677
I guess so.

384
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,846
Get a good cut.

385
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,770
BEEF, 50% OFF

386
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,315
This should be good enough, right?
It's not for people.

387
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,443
-[butcher] We have more of that.
-No thanks. Not this one.

388
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,279
Korean sirloin, please.

389
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,115
Your best cut.

390
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,617
ULSAN, GEOCHANG, POHANG

391
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,589
This info stays between us.

392
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,259
No one can find out I told you.

393
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,886
If it gets back to Min, he'll kill me.

394
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,597
Don't worry, you're safe with me.

395
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,310
Just give me his number.

396
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,487
Keep your word.

397
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,532
Appreciate it. Go.

398
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,201
[sighs]

399
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,331
[line ringing]

400
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,668
Hi. It's Inspector Yang.

401
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,129
Special Investigations Unit.

402
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,715
I'd like to chat for a bit.

403
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,925
Oh, yeah.

404
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,552
I know who you are.

405
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,471
How did you get my number?

406
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,351
Now, why would he do that?

407
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,190
He would never. Absolutely not.

408
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,525
[sighs]

409
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,236
Actually, you can ask yourself.
He's right here.

410
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,322
One moment, please.

411
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,995
This is Deokhee Choi.

412
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,538
[Min] <i>Hey, Dr. Choi.</i>

413
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,251
Oh, I had heard you left for China.
I guess I was mistaken.

414
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,464
Well, to be honest,
that's not really any of your concern.

415
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,635
I just got off the phone
with Dongyeong Yang

416
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,095
from the Special Investigations Unit.

417
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,932
[chuckling]
I'm pretty pissed about it, actually.

418
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,769
Why did he call? What did he say exactly?

419
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,897
Did you leak my number, Doctor?

420
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,981
<i>No.</i>

421
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,233
I don't have it.

422
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,109
I never asked for it.

423
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,115
I can't help you unless
you tell me what's going on here.

424
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,368
Why don't you start
with what Yang said to you?

425
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,452
[chuckles]

426
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,329
[slaps]

427
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,166
[Min grunts]

428
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,296
That jackass is basically writing a novel
at this point.

429
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,673
Hmm.

430
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:14,219
Spouting some BS about a huge
black market surgery ring causing trouble.

431
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,472
Now he's saying they murdered a nurse

432
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,350
and kidnapped one of the detectives
or whatever.

433
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,354
[inhales sharply]

434
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,399
He'll let me off the hook
if I tell him everything I know.

435
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,488
Mr. Min,
you don't know a thing about it anyway.

436
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,575
You're really doubting me?
[scoffs] I know quite a lot.

437
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,161
Like that Ms. Jeong.

438
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,832
Yeah, I know about your precious student.

439
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,334
<i>You're still looking for that crazy girl.</i>

440
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:52,424
<i>I've agreed to meet with Yang later.</i>
<i>I bet you're a little interested now, huh?</i>

441
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,843
We should meet first.

442
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,178
[chuckles] I'll think about it.

443
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,106
[Ms. Ra] What's going on?

444
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,275
Dr. Choi!

445
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,780
[line ringing]

446
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,075
Yang. It's me.

447
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,578
Where are you? Can you meet with me?

448
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,997
I didn't expect you
to call first like this.

449
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,458
No, I can't today, because I'm booked.

450
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,794
<i>Come on, I'll go to you. Where are you?</i>

451
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,590
I really can't. You'd be a third wheel.

452
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,176
<i>Who are you gonna see?</i>
<i>I said I can come to you.</i>

453
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,263
We'll talk later. Bye.

454
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,603
I'm a suspect now, is that it?

455
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,396
Is it?

456
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,029
-Kim, hold on.
-Yes?

457
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,156
Besides the three of us here,

458
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,409
does anyone know we're seeing Min today?

459
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,703
No one else knows, sir.

460
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:06,998
Right.

461
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,923
[chuckles] Yeah, sorry I'm late.

462
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,550
I didn't want to show up here
empty-handed, that's all.

463
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,304
It's okay, I just got here myself.

464
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,476
[door closes]

465
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,610
Damn, look at this place. [laughs]

466
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,446
No one ever comes here besides me anyway.

467
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,324
Kick up your feet. Make yourself at home.

468
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,661
I was already getting tired
of bouncing around motels.

469
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,372
[chuckles] Now I get to live in luxury,
thanks to you.

470
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,667
So when were you planning
on going to China?

471
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,087
Well, I need to find
a ship again and stuff.

472
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,880
So we'll see.

473
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,509
[sighs]

474
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,303
Hey. [grunts]

475
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,183
[groans, sighs] Hmm.

476
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,609
To get into med school
with the highest score at 17 years old,

477
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,571
-just how high must your IQ be?
-[door closes]

478
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,655
[chuckles]

479
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,333
Star neurosurgeon at Yeonshin University,
Seok Jeong.

480
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,418
[chuckles]

481
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,797
I was shocked
when I found out who she was.

482
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,258
Man, chick's got some real balls on her,

483
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,178
doing black market brain surgery,
you know? Huh?

484
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,893
Hyeonho Han. Know the guy?

485
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:56,733
He's probably busting his ass right now,
trying to clean up after her, huh?

486
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,985
Ah, it's a shame
that he partnered with her.

487
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,988
Guy should have just
worked for me instead.

488
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,579
So what's the plan?

489
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,332
What are you going to do if you meet Yang?

490
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,293
Well, that depends.

491
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,921
I have to see what kind of deal
they're offering, you know?

492
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,882
Nothing about it is set in stone yet.

493
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,135
He says they'll drop
all the charges against me and whatnot,

494
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,721
which sounds nice,
but I can't trust those bastards.

495
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,890
I know the guy pretty well.

496
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,059
His word is worthless.

497
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,102
That's the kind of guy he is.

498
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,188
So what kind are you?

499
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,398
You a man of your word then?

500
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
More often than not.

501
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,535
Way things are now, all I gotta do is
point out who did the surgeries,

502
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,788
and that'd be enough to put
a stupid little smile on their faces.

503
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,289
[laughs]

504
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,385
Did you do her? That Jeong chick.

505
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,470
Ah, you totally did!

506
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,984
[spluttering]

507
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,242
Just kidding. I'm messing with you.

508
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,660
Take a joke.

509
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,078
[chuckles]

510
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,498
[sighs]

511
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,877
But seriously, I just don't understand it.

512
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,631
Well, if it's not about that,
then what the hell is it, huh?

513
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,176
Why would you do all this
for a girl who tried to kill you?

514
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,805
[phone ringing]

515
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,602
Oh, here he is.

516
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,106
-Hey, Inspector. You've arrived?
-Yeah. Where are you?

517
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,150
I'm here at the spot.

518
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,278
<i>Ah, geez.</i>
<i>And it must have been a long trip too.</i>

519
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,114
<i>I'm sorry, but something</i>
<i>really urgent just came up.</i>

520
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
[Yang] <i>Stop messing with me.</i>

521
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,577
<i>I know you're around here somewhere.</i>

522
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,120
<i>I really didn't bring anyone.</i>

523
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,710
<i>Well, to be honest,</i>
<i>I brought the rookie on my team with me.</i>

524
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,712
<i>Come on, let's talk in person.</i>

525
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,509
And I do have a lot of info for you,
but I haven't made up my mind yet.

526
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,761
[chuckles]

527
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:34,182
I think I'll just piss you off
if I keep talking, so I'm hanging up now.

528
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,767
[Yang] <i>No, wa-wait, Min. Hold on.</i>

529
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,062
Let me think on it for a while
and then I'll call you back.

530
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,897
-All right, bye.
-<i>No, wa-wait, hold on--</i>

531
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,106
[phone beeps]

532
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,109
That son of a bitch.

533
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,362
You gotta be kidding me.

534
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,953
Well, I hope… [clears throat]

535
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,914
…that you don't think about it
for too long.

536
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,291
I know, I know.

537
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,878
I gotta make a decision soon, don't I?
[laughs]

538
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,422
So, yeah. I'll be in touch.

539
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,007
[sighs]

540
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,134
If that's what you want…

541
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,053
[sighs]

542
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,347
…that's what we'll do.

543
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,569
But seriously, what's your deal
with her, huh?

544
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,740
Is it something that someone like me
just wouldn't get? [chuckles]

545
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,493
[coughs]

546
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,581
[door opens]

547
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,166
I'll just say goodbye here.

548
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,301
[line ringing]

549
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,803
Hey, yeah, it's me.

550
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,347
Just wanted to share
the good news with you.

551
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,350
I think we can go ahead
and schedule the surgery now.

552
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,980
Of course he's a big shot.
He's at Yeonshin University Hospital.

553
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,941
Yeah, you have nothing to worry about.

554
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,944
Top surgeon in the country. That's right.

555
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,626
[phone buzzing]

556
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,133
Hey! What the hell?

557
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,767
Yes?

558
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,394
So what?

559
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,648
Where do I need to go?

560
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,923
[breathing shakily]

561
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,009
[chuckles]

562
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,530
Please have a seat.

563
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,287
You heard about the nurse
that was killed, right?

564
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,040
You see, it's putting me in a tough spot.

565
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,876
If the authorities start digging around,

566
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,339
soon enough they'll be able to trace it
all back to me and my men.

567
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,675
And we'll take the rap for it.

568
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,220
We needed to know what went down so we
could figure out what we're dealing with.

569
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,222
Luckily your friend confessed
to everything

570
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,015
so we got the whole picture from him.

571
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,767
-He said that he killed her?
-So he claims.

572
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,561
But we all know he doesn't have the guts.

573
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,771
So he's gotta be lying through his teeth.

574
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,357
-[chuckles]
-Oh? You clearly have some thoughts.

575
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
I think I'm tired of dancing around this.

576
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,363
Just say what you've gotta say.

577
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,616
So it was you. I knew it.

578
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,499
The thing is, I can take care of myself.

579
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,004
This won't cause problems for you,
because I already have it all handled.

580
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,173
So stop being dramatic, will you?

581
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,344
You know, I've always been
a great judge of character.

582
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,972
Even at first glance, I could tell…

583
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,641
You're something else. [chuckles]

584
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,768
Sanggi, the picture.

585
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,530
Okay. So?

586
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,240
What do you want me to do?

587
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,826
You said you won't cause me
any problems, right?

588
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,038
So make sure this guy doesn't say
another word to the cops.

589
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,831
Ever.

590
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,001
Are we clear?

591
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:36,275
[Dr. Choi] <i>Well, sometimes, the things you</i>
<i>have to do aren't exactly what you want.</i>

592
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,578
Wanna move to the Philippines together?

593
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,208
The Philippines? Just like that?

594
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,712
-So, listen. I've been thinking--
-No, stop it. Stop.

595
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,715
I don't want to hear about
what you were thinking.

596
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,470
Hey! Hey, listen to me!

597
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:06,973
Hey!

598
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,892
[groans] Just hear me out!

599
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,812
I don't wanna hear any of your nonsense.
The Philippines, really?

600
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,314
I mean, why not, huh?
We could open a clinic there.

601
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,025
Oh, it's that easy?
Where would we get the funds?

602
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:22,154
The deposit on the house.
And also money from the pharmacy.

603
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:25,533
-I hear it's affordable there.
-Oh, what is going on with you?

604
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,576
Can you come to your senses, please?

605
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,208
I'm just sick of it here.
I can't stand it.

606
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,669
So, what? You wanna run away?

607
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,838
It's not running away.

608
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,674
Let's just pack up and get outta here!

609
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,427
"My house, my dogs, my work, my diner."

610
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,721
You went on and on
about it all being yours.

611
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,890
You even killed someone for that diner,
and now you just wanna go?

612
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,185
You said it! You said
that you'd follow me anywhere I went.

613
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,478
Did I now?

614
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,314
I can't just follow you anywhere.

615
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,275
I thought you would. You wouldn't?

616
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,111
What are you talking about?
I can't just go!

617

Ms. Jeong. Finally, you're here.

623
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,406
-Hey, where were you?
-What happened?

624
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,658
What happened here? What? Wh…

625
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,702
I was patrolling the area
and saw the fire.

626
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,413
I called it in, but luckily
only your shed was burning.

627
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,248
The rest of the house seems fine.

628
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,795
It's not a shed.

629
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,422
It's where I keep my dogs. [gasps]

630
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,424

Yes, Doctor.

638
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,213
The fire department just came
to put out the fire.

639
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,424
Everything is handled, but…

640
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,345
[sighs] …I do worry how she'll take it.

[Dr. Choi] <i>I know.</i>

Shit.

665
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,662
It doesn't really look like it
was caused by a short circuit, does it?

666
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,047
How did the fire only burn this part here?

667
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:43,387
Ms. Seok said it was the short circuit.
And then she sent the police away.

668
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,598
They could have looked into it.

669
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,560
That's what I said. [sighs]

670
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,689
I think we might move abroad.

Ah.

Perhaps you should drink your coffee
and be on your way.

684

Dr. Jeong and I have absolutely
nothing at all to say to you, okay?

685
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,216
I'm the victim here. So who do you think
you are speaking to me like that?

686
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,010
Well, we never did anything to you,
so how can that be the case?

687
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,264
Ah, it seems you've forgotten.
Though that's not really a surprise.

688
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,434
Do you know how much I had to pay because
you two bailed out on me back then?

689
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,646
We didn't know
it involved organ trafficking.

690

If we did, you can be sure neither
one of us would've agreed to do it.

You were med school hotshots
who ended up underground.

for that kind of stuff from the get-go,

00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,742
so spare me the sob story.

695
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,789
If I had known you were just a couple
of snobs who didn't know their place,

696
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,833
I wouldn't have hired you.

697
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,713
Glad you're here, Mr. Min.

698
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,966
I was thinking of calling you actually.

699
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,217
This works out.

700
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,889
Are you sick or something?

701
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,809
You look like shit, you know.

702
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,603
I recommend you go get a checkup.

703
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,021
[chuckles]

704
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,649
I could say the same thing to you,
Dr. Jeong.

705
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,445
Here.

706
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,697
MRI FINDINGS REPORT

707
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,242
It's not organ trafficking.

708
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,327
It's what you like.

709
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,620
Surgery.

710
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:55,829
[sighs]

711
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,958
Dr. Han and I? We agreed
we're not gonna work with you again.

712
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,296
-Just open it first, yeah?
-Are you hard of hearing, or what?

713
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,798
Come on, Dr. Jeong. Are you kidding?

714
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,134
I said we're not touching
your filthy work!

715
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,434
Dr. Han, how do you even work
with someone like her? Huh?

716
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,953
You might have forgotten this.

717
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,789
You still owe me, you know.

718
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,710
Oh.

719
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:45,879
That's right.

720
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,799
How much was it?

721
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,552
120 million.
And that's with interest. Total.

722
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,137
That's my debt.

723
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,724
-We can talk about it later.
-Come on, Doctor, get real.

724
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,893
You think I fronted the money
because of you?

725
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,604
I don't really care who used it where.

726
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,941
I lent that money to Dr. Jeong.

727
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,568
Didn't I?

728
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,844
[Seo] Ugh, I get seasick.

729
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,889
On this large ship you'll be just fine.

730
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,560
They wouldn't get a ship that rocks
so hard when they need surgery.

731
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,272
So who's the patient anyway?

732
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,023
Did he tell you anything else?

733
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,401
I don't know. He didn't tell me a thing.

734
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,946
Well, I heard
that you can't do this surgery alone.

735
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,823
No, you need two surgeons.

736
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,658
Did they find someone else then?

737
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,744
Min said that he had someone ready to go.

738
00:58:58,827 --> 00:58:59,953
They'll be here soon.

739
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,037
[Min] Ah.

740
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,832
When's the other surgeon getting here?

741
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,751
I think any second now.

742
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,422
Oh, there he is right there. Yeah.

743
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,929
So you already know each other, right?

744
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,098
What's that look?

745
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,601
You're upset, aren't you?

746
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:09,940
Yeah.

747
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,192
Maybe I am.
