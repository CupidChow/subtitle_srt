00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,560
[horn honks]

2
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,941
[driver] Excuse me,
which way is the hospital?

3
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,452
Ah, thank you.

4
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,144
[Dr. Song] Oh, Myeongjin!

5
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,563
[Myeongjin] It's been so long.
It's good to see you.

6
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,648
YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,233
-How have you been?
-How are you?

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,736
-You've been doing all right?
-Of course.

9
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,197
Look at you. You haven't changed at all.

10
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,740
[Dr. Choi chuckles] What do you mean?

11
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,909
-I'm an old man now.
-[Myeongjin] Oh, please.

12
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,536
-[chuckling]
-[Uyeong] Hmm.

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,954
-[Myeongjin] Kiyoung, come here.
-Yeah.

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,998
I think that's his friend
that was coming from LA.

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,708
-From LA?
-[sighs]

16
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,796
He and Dr. Choi were both Class of '84.
Dr. Myeongjin Kim. Meningioma, I hear.

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,548
Meningioma?

18
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,633
[Dr. Song, Myeongjin, Dr. Choi laughing]

19
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,927
So, he came to our hospital
for Dr. Choi, then?

20
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,012
I guess so.

21
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,763
Hurry up, come here. Come on over.

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,099
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

23
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,436
-My son Kiyoung.
-Oh, nice to meet you.

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,605
-I've heard so much about you from my dad.
-Nothing flattering, I'm sure.

25
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,234
Uh, actually,
he said you're the best surgeon he knows.

26
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,111
Just look at him laughing like that.

27
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,821
-Bye.
-Don't worry, you're gonna be just fine.

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,490
I know, right?
I guess he really missed Dr. Kim.

29
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,076
You ever seen him laugh so much?

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,828
[Dr. Choi]
It'll be like taking a nice nap.

31
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,996
Exactly.

32
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,122
[Myeongjin] Sounds good.

33
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,999
-It's a bit much.
-[Myeongjin] I feel reassured.

34
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,009
[sighs] Why don't you find an apartment
near the hospital?

35
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,094
I can help you look.

36
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,180
I'm leaving for Boston,
so what's the point?

37
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,432
Isn't the candidate being announced
next week?

38
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,312
Right. It's already a done deal
pretty much.

39
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,065
[gasps]

40
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,285
-Hey, this is Dr. Choi's lamp, isn't it?
-Yeah.

41
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,706
I asked for it, and he gave it to me.
Why? Is it expensive?

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,376
-You said you asked for it?
-Yeah.

43
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,256
Why do you keep asking him
to give you all his stuff?

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,841
You should give it a try.

45
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,178
-I doubt it'll work for you though.
-[scoffs]

46
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,389
What? Are you jealous?

47
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,769
No. Not at all.
I got one just like this in my room.

48
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,106
Be as jealous as you want. [groans]

49
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,399
Man, I'm fried.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,986
Hey, can you close the curtains?

51
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,367
Is that good?

52
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,578
Yeah. Now get out and shut the door.
I'm going to sleep.

53
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,831
Right.

54
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
Get some sleep. Please.

55
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,004
[door closes]

56
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,637
What do I have to worry about?

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,140
-I've got the best surgeon. [laughs]
-Come on.

58
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,899
51 WARD

59
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,403
-Hello.
-Hi.

60
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,613
-[Seok] Oh, hi there, Ms. Na.
-Oh, hi there, Dr. Jeong.

61
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,031
Dr. Choi come by here?

62
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,326
He's been busy, you know.
Ever since Dr. Kim was admitted.

63
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,078
Oh, there he is.

64
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,415
The summer training, wasn't it?
You had a terrible stomach flu.

65
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,501
[Ms. Na] He seems really nervous
about operating on him.

66
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,672
You're telling me he's nervous about it?
There's no way.

67
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
But you understand, mistakes can happen.

68
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,678
He's never made a mistake in surgery,
not even once.

69
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,432
[Ms. Na] I think it might be different.
It's his friend, after all.

70
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,851
[doctors chuckling]

71
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,565
-It even leaked out a little, didn't it?
-[laughing]

72
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:38,195
Come on, I was squatting the whole time.
That's why my posture's like this.

73
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,238
-When's the surgery?
-Tomorrow.

74
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,366
-[doctors laughing]
-[Myeongjin] No, I'm being serious.

75
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,535
I wasn't scheduled for tomorrow though.

76
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,745
RESTRICTED AREA

77
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,499
[Ms. Na] <i>Dr. Choi wanted Dr. Ha</i>
<i>to scrub in on this one.</i>

78
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,881
[Uyeong] Hmm? What?

79
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,633
[sprightly music ends]

80
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,177
[machine beeping]

81
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,484
What's taking him so long?

82
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,903
[Ms. Na] I'm not sure.

83
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,656
Go find Dr. Ha. Quickly.

84
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,283
Sorry I'm late.

85
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,871
What are you doing here? Where's Uyeong?

86
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,208
He suddenly got an upset stomach,
so I'm filling in.

87
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,585
Ready when you are, Doctor.

88
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,131
[Dr. Choi inhales sharply]

89
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,679
Uhâ€¦

90
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,058
[device beeping]

91
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,685
-Battery.
-Sorry, Doctor.

92
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,230
Knife.

93
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,566
Knife.

94
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,530
-[inhales sharply, grunts]
-[Ms. Na] Are you all right?

95
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,535
I'm sorry, Doctor.
That shouldn't have happened. My mistake.

96
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,665
[sighs]

97
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,584
[Ms. Na] You need to be more careful!

98
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,086
It's not like you to make a mistake
like this. [gasps]

99
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,256
Oh, my goodness.

100
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,216
Nurse Kim.

101
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,260
Dr. Choi.

102
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,554
This way, Doctor.

103
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,182
[Seok] Don't worry, Doctor.

104
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,728
I'll take over from here.

105
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,940
[sighs]

106
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,327
All right. Let's get started, shall we?

107
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,912
Knife.

108
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,170
[sighs]

109
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,315
The surgery was a success.

110
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,193
Why did you do that?

111
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,825
Because a surgical error on your record,
it wouldn't look good, Doctor.

112
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,120
What?

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,081
Surgical error?

114
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

115
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,169
[chuckles]

116
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,382
You said it yourself, Dr. Choi.

117
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,842
We're the same, you and I.

118
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,011
Two sides of the same coin.

119
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,013
We can see through each other.

120
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,057
[inhales sharply]

121
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,481
I figured out what you were going to do.

122
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,817
No one else had any idea.

123
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,361
But I could tell
what you were planning all along.

124
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,239
-That's bad, Dr. Choi.
-[sighs]

125
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,951
And what was I going to do?

126
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,666
Mess up the surgery
without anyone noticing.

127
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,878
That's why you wanted Uyeong
to scrub in instead of me, isn't it?

128
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,506
You knew I'd be the one to notice it all.

129
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,718
[sighs]

130
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,972
What are you saying?
There was nothing to notice.

131
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,144
He's not actually your friend, is he?

132
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,895
You hate him.

133
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,525
If he was your friend,
then why were you so tense?

134
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,776
[chuckles]

135
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,445
You really were, Doctor.

136
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,072
You looked so uncomfortable.

137
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,162
It was obvious. You couldn't stand him.

138
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,122
[chuckles]

139
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,957
[grunts]

140
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,625
Are you leaving?

141
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,676
[door opens, closes]

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,770
HYPER KNIFE

143
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,483
[Dr. Choi sighs]

144
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,992
[scoffs]

145
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,878
What the hell?

146
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423
[sighs]

147
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,027
[grunts]

148
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,490
What the hell is this?
What's your problem?

149
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,575
Why would you do this?

150
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,245
[Seok grunts]
Everything about me is a problem.

151
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,539
I thought you'd know this by now.

152
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,542
-[panting] Shit.
-[sighs]

153
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,963
Could be deeper, don't you think?

154
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,299
It's deep enough as it is, actually.

155
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,843
[clears throat]

156
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,638
What if somebody finds it?

157
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,014
Will you run?

158
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,852
-Where would you even go?
-None of your business.

159
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,770
What if you get caught?

160
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,024
They'll put you away in prison
for the rest of your life. You know that.

161
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,361
[sighs]

162
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,365
My life is different from yours, Doctor.

163
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,993
It's already been ruined
for a long time now,

164
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,537
so I don't care if I live or die.

165
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,583
If it comes to it, I'll kill myself.
You got that?

166
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,376
Why bother with prison?

167
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,046
Your life isn't ruined, Seok.

168
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,549
I'm telling you to go Boston.

169
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,260
I can make that happen,
just like you wanted.

170
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,637
[sighs]

171
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,099
Don't wanna? Too bad.

172
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,810
Go there and start fresh.

173
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,314
Yeah, but there's a catch, isn't there?
Your little operation.

174
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,357
[scoffs] I won't do it.

175
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,401
You're pathetic.

176
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,153
[scoffs]

177
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,531
[sighs]

178
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,036
If I'm really that pathetic, then just
call the cops right now and finish this!

179
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,163
You littleâ€¦

180
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,834
Oh, yeah, you need me to operate.

181
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,880
[sighs]
So you have to keep following me around

182
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,758
and begging me till I agree to it.

183
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,469
Did I get that right?

184
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,388
Huh? [chuckles]

185
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,143
You were a penniless kid
when I took you under my wing.

186
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,730
You should know that everything you had
was because of me.

187
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,106
Otherwise, you'd have had nothing.

188
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,279
Why do you think I helped you?

189
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,990
It's 'cause I felt sorry for you,
that's why.

190
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,910
You showed up with nothing but a backpack,

191
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,746
foolishly strutting around,
thinking you were smarter than everyone.

192
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,959
It was so pathetic,
I couldn't help but step in.

193
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,211
Got that? [huffs]

194
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,384
[Ms. Ra] Dr. Choi!

195
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,971
Where are you?

196
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,348
-Shit.
-[Ms. Ra] Dr. Choi!

197
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
[phone ringing]

198
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,522

199
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,357
[ringing continues]

200
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,197
MS. RA

201
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,575
Deal with it. And stop giving me problems.

202
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,660

203
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,959

205
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,132
-Oh, finally.
-<i>Where are you?</i>

206
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,010
Really? [sighs]

207
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,930
I was waiting for you,
but you were taking so long.

208
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,807
Where are you now?

209
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,225
I went down already.

210
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,769
I came downâ€¦

211
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,565
But-But the other side.

212
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,944
<i>You said the other side?</i>
<i>Uh, you mean, the way back to town?</i>

213
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,656
Uh, yes. Yes, that sounds right.

214
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,701
I'll come to where you are, then.
I'll bring the car around.

215
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,912
-Okay, I'll wait here.
-<i>Sounds good.</i>

216
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,041
<i>Oh, right, did you find her?</i>

217
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,878
Yeah, why?

218
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,672
Well then, what was she doing over there?

219
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,801
She was up to something
when I was tailing her earlier.

220
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,436
Uh, she was burying her dog.
I guess her dog died.

221
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,148
Yeah.

222
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,275
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,116
No, everything's fine, yeah.

224
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,743
Yeah.

225
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,549
MARI'S DINER

226
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,384
[officer] Where's Mr. Singyu Kwon today?

227
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,303
[Mari] Oh, he didn't come home last night.

228
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,181
So, he's not here then? Where'd he go?

229
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,059
I have no idea. He didn't tell me.

230
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,478
[officer sighs]

231
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,279
Miss, did you hear?
The cops don't know he's dead yet.

232
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,990
You talk too much.

233
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,700
You sure he's buried deep enough?

234
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,828
You didn't half-ass it again, did you?

235
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,959
-[officer] Ms. Jeong.
-[Seok] Oh!

236
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,753
Oh, hey. Have you had lunch?

237
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:25,550
Yeah. I actually have some concerns
about Singyu Kwon.

238
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,470
-Singyu Kwon? Who is that?
-With the ankle monitor.

239
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,268
Just a couple days ago,
he got his ankle monitor removed

240
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,312
which means we can no longer
track his location or keep tabs on him.

241
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,358
-Really?
-Yes, so please be careful.

242
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,069
That creep could show up
and bother you again.

243
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,991
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him at all today.

244
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,201
[officer] He didn't come home last night.

245
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,870
He wouldn't stop yapping about Seoul,

246
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,329
so, maybe he went there.

247
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,666
Anyway, please be careful, Ms. Jeong.

248
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,501
Oh, yeah, thanks.

249
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,261
He has no idea
who should be careful of whom.

250
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,722
[sighs]

251
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,807
I'm happy.

252
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,311
[Seo] I'm sorry? Happy?

253
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,062
Yeah.

254
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,233
His sister doesn't have to sell the place
anymore,

255
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,320
and I can keep coming here to eat
every day if I want to.

256
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,614
[exhales deeply] Oh, man.

257
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,117
A perfect happy ending, don't you agree?

258
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,039
Hey. I don't think
I've ever been more happy.

259
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,917
[scoffs]

260
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,669
You really might be a demon.

261
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,380
You're gonna go to hell.

262
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,465

Are you Ms. Seok Jeong?

269
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,197
Yeah, what is this?

270
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,575
We're from
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

271

-I'm so sorry. Please wait. Sorry.
-Wait. What's going on here?

272
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,458
-Sorry. I apologise for the inconvenience.
-Geez.

Sorry about this, everyone. I'm sorry.

They're here about substitute medication.

283

If this was really an issue,

284
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,504
half of the pharmacies in the country
would have to shut down.

285
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,173
It seems like Dr. Choi is pretty upset
by all this.

286
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,095
Well, what about tomorrow's surgery then?

287
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,888
Huh? Still on?

Seriously? For how long?

290
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,898
Not sure. I think we should feel it out.

291
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,444
Dr. Jeong, apologies,
I'll contact you later, okay?

A 10-YEAR WINNING STREAK?

351
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,277
Any comments on potentially winning
at the Ichida Awards for the tenth year?

352
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,821
What's the reason for canceling your visit
to Busan University Hospital?

353
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,365
The Ichida Awards are being hosted
in Busan, many say you're the reasonâ€¦

354
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,117
-Could you tell us about your scheduleâ€¦
-Doctor?

355
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,662
Wow, Dr. Choi must be really famous.

356
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,332
Why is everyone making such a fuss?
I want to puke.

357
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,586
I really hope that one day
you'll be as famous as he is.

358
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,131
-And get the recognition you deserve.
-I'm already done for.

359
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,174
Why do you say depressing things
all the time?

360
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,847
Why exactly does it bother you so much?

361
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,473
Do you like me?

362
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,392
I thought we liked each other.

363
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,399
Of course we like each other. You're mine.
[scoffs]

364
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:26,030
Right. So, it's the same
as liking your phone. 'Cause you own it?

365
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,581
-[reporter 1, sighs] No answers?
-[reporter 2] Yeah, I hear you.

366
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,000
-It's been a really tough day.
-I'm going to the bathroom.

367
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,418
-I'll go with you.
-Let's go together.

368
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,920
-Good night, guys.
-Good work. Thank you.

369
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,046
-Good night.
-Bye.

370
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,596
That Ichida lady decided to stay
in her suite, didn't she?

371
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,349
She'll only come out
for her official interview and that's it.

372
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,352
Well, I don't think that's okay
for the main sponsor to do.

373
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,687
If she's just gonna hide from the press,

374
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,023
why even bother putting together
this kind of event?

375
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,275
Yeah, well, she's in no shape
to deal with the press.

376
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,110
Her son is gonna die any day now.

377
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,030
Wait a minute. How do you know that?

378
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,116
It's old news.
I'm surprised you haven't heard about it

379
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,701
[scoffs]

380
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,745
If only someone performed the surgery
on her son.

381
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,413
Then we'd really have a story
worth printing.

382
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,082
Yeah. But who's gonna risk that?

383
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,376
I mean, doctors today know better.

384
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,045
It's not that it's a risk.

385
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,798
It's an impossible surgery
in the first place. That's all.

386
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,884
Well, what if Dr. Deokhee Choi
did it himself?

387
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,803
Oh, that'd be amazing.

388
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,012
-Wouldn't it?
-For sure.

389
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,597
-All done, girls?
-Yeah, let's go.

390
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,099
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,074
ICHIDA AWARD: FOR CONTRIBUTING
TO THE MEDICAL FIELD

392
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,709
How come we're always broke
no matter what we do?

393
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,836
[Seok] I'm sad about it too.

394
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,464
I'm out there killing people but
that still doesn't put food on the table.

395
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,425
All that work for nothing.

396
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,807
So,

397
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,561
I know that Dr. Choi
might have influence and all

398
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,856
but can he really overturn
the suspension on the pharmacy?

399
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,942
He might be able to,
but it'll take some time.

400
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,193
It's just annoying for us.

401
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,573
You're gonna go see him tomorrow, right?

402
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,076
[inhales sharply] I was going to.

403
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,413
-I changed my mind though.
-Huh?

404
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,667
Seeing him earlier,
it made me really pissed off.

405
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,297
He still seems to think
he's the best there is.

406
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,011
He needs to be humiliatedâ€¦ [sighs]
â€¦so he'll come to his senses.

407
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,723
[sighs] Whatever.

408
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,350
Just don't kill him, okay?

409
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,271
Yeah, yeah. I won't, don't worry.

410
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,691
Hurry up and go to bed!

411
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,820
Geez.

412
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,114
DAEHO MOTEL

413
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,491
[horns honking]

414
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,081
[sighs]

415
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,423
[phone chimes]

416
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,144
HARU ONLY TOOK A FEW SIPS
OF PORRIDGE FOR DINNER AS USUAL

417
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,109
[doorbell rings]

418
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,955
[in Japanese] Good evening.

419
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,667
You remember me, right?

420
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:57,593
We met once in Tokyo
when Dr. Choi Deokhee introduced us.

421
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,304
Oh, I remember now.

422
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,309
Life hasn't been kind to you.

423
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,855
-You have aged a lot.
-[sighs]

424
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:14,902
Operations should be seen
on the big screen.

425
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,154
What on earth are you up to?

426
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,033
[TV powers up]

427
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,121
[rhythmic beeping]

428
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,540
Na Seokjin, age 16.

429
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,962
In June 2022,
he was diagnosed with brainstem glioma.

430
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:39,927
A large 4-centimeter tumor was found
in the center of his brainstem,

431
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:44,181
but nine university hospitals refused
to perform the surgery.

432
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:50,312
This footage is evidence
of how this boy was saved.

433
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,233
Why are you showing me this?

434
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,612
If it were a simple brainstem glioma,

435
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:03,075
why do you think
so many doctors refused to operate on him?

436
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,369
The truth is,

437
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:13,210
this boy has hemophilia, which is
also what your son Haru Ichida has.

438
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,682
To remove a tumor so deeply embedded
in the brainstem,

439
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:31,478
you need to make a large incision
to get a clear view.

440
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,899
But for patients
with hemophilia whose bleeding won't stop,

441
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,529
this kind of extensive surgery
is a risky gamble.

442
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:46,368
That's why all those surgeons
refused to operate on him.

443
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,542
My plan? To approach the occipital area
from a sitting position,

444
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:58,130
making an incision at the upper tentorium
to access the tumor.

445
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:04,386
I gave him FFP and Botropase
while controlling the blood vessels

446
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,388
and started removing the tumor.

447
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,227
If there's any bleeding at this point,

448
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:17,357
it becomes a race against the clock
from that moment.

449
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,402
But even with blood-clotting agents,

450
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,781
there must have been clear limitations
in an extensive procedure like this.

451
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,287
Just watch and see what I did.

452
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,674
[Seok hums]

453
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,217
Five hours and 23 minutes.

454
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,428
The kid pulled through and survived.

455
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:36,144
If you had nicked even one blood vessel
while removing the tumorâ€¦

456
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,479
He would've died.

457
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,023
Because he would have bled out.

458
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:45,195
But I didn't mess
with a single one of them.

459
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:55,413
Let me save your son, Haru Ichida.

460
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,835
[scoffs] Haru is younger than that boy.

461
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,170
He won't survive a five-hour surgery.

462
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,219
Four hours, tops.

463
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,806
What if I can finish it in that time?

464
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,978
What do you want from me?

465
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,197
INTERVIEW WITH DR. CHOI DEOKHEE

466
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,993
I want to make him miserable.

467
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,697
-A lot of people are predictingâ€¦
-A non-Japanese doctor winning this award

468
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,742
-consecutively has raised controversy.
-Could you share a few words on that?

469
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,203
[Seok] Have you decided?

470
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,040
My answer is no. Please leave.

471
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:24,920
You know my offer only stands
until the ceremony begins, right?

472
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,672
The moment you hand over that trophy
to Dr. Choi,

473
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,175
you can no longer expect me
to operate on your son.

474
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,722
I won't accept such an arrangement.

475
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,140
[scoffs]

476
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:43,813
Ms. Ichida, is your pride
more important than your son's life?

477
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:48,151
Dr. Choi was selected as the winner
through a fair assessment.

478
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,988
The fact that you're trying to sabotage it

479
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,408
means you're a despicable human being.

480
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,373
Why would I entrust my son's life
to someone like you?

481
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,975
-How are you?
-I'm good.

482
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,479
[no audible dialogue]

483
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,501
[in English] Hey! What are you doing here?

484
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,296
Are you here to make a scene
at the ceremony?

485
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,760
Hey, Seok!

486
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,930
-[engine starts]
-Hey, hey!

487
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,103
[sighs] Are you serious?

488
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,355
[birdsong]

489
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,784
-[phone buzzing]
-[knock on door]

490
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,373
[buzzing continues]

491
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,379
Oh, thanks.

492
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,886
Dr. Choi, how are you?

493
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,221
I was actually thinking of calling you
just now.

494
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,517
Oh, and congrats in advance, huh?
The awards are tomorrow, aren't they?

495
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,520
<i>Yeah, thank you. So when are you coming?</i>

496
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,564
Uhâ€¦

497
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,652
[inhales deeply]
Maybe the week after next?

498
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,656
Okay, so, two weeks from now?

499
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,865
[Alan] <i>That's right.</i>

500
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,077
<i>Oh, how are you managing</i>
<i>without medication? Any issues?</i>

501
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,871
Well, I've been feeling fine
for the last few days.

502
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,040
Anyway, did you see the video I sent?

503
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>Yeah, I'm watching it right now.</i>

504
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,755
Actually, I haven't stopped watching it
all morning.

505
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,384
[sighs] This is amazing work.

506
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,636
It is, isn't it?

507
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,305
So, let's hear it. What's your answer?

508
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,849
Uhâ€¦ [sighs]

509
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,976
When were you thinking
of scheduling the surgery?

510
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,395
Do you have a date locked in?

511
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,855
If you're in, I can start preparing.

512
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,607
So, what will it be, huh?

513
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,319
[clicks tongue] If she's gonna be with me,
I'm okay with it.

514
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,657
[scoffs] Okay, huh? No, you're honored.

515
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,035
[Alan chuckles] <i>Right, I'm honored.</i>

516
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,120
[knock on door]

517
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,996
All right, I'll talk to you later.

-Doctor, we should go.
-Let me get my jacket.

520
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,890
Earlier, I ran into Seok.
I was really surprised to see her.

521
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,518
Okay, what about it then?

522
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,231
Well, it's an important night.
Will you be okay?

523
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,361
Well, if she wants to watch the ceremony,
you should get her a good seat.

524
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,323
She needs to see
how the world really works.

525
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,117
Sure.

526
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,163

00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,471
You're right. [chuckles]

-Here he comes.

-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

534
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,564
Enjoy.

535
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,698
[Seok] Doctor.

536
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,424
-It's good to see you.
-Yeah, it's been a while.

537
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,675
How's everything going?

This is Dr. John and Dr. George.

[in English] Oh. Hello.

545
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,921
Hello.

00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,893
[sighs]

547
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,571
[in Japanese] You should go easy on
the drinks, or you'll pay for it tomorrow.

548
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,614
[chuckles] What?

549
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,784
You think I'll deliver
a drunken speech tomorrow?

550
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,287
[laughing]

551
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:37,250
By the way, I noticed
you didn't bring your friend this year.

552
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,378
Your female student that you introduced
to me before.

553
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,965
The one you couldn't stop
singing praises for.

554
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,303
Ah. Jeong Seok?

555
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,471
Is she well?

556
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,223
Yes, of course she is.

557
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,727
How is she doing these days?

558
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,521
[chuckles] Is she still perfect?

559
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,232
[scoffs] Perfect?

560
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,823
She was never less than perfect.

561
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,159
She's always been perfect.

562
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,830
Look at those fools over there.

563
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,875
Those idiots think they're so great.

564
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,544
She's better than tenâ€¦

565
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:26,966
Noâ€¦ She's better than a hundred
of them combined.

566
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,054
Do you know why?

567
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,768
Because Seok never hesitates
in the operating room.

568
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,730
The concept of failure never
even enters her mind, ever.

569
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,233
And she's never failedâ€¦

570
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,029
-[chuckles] Not even once?
-Not even once.

Four hours, max.

If you fail, I will make you pay for it.

-Yes, Doctor!
-Get as many lap pads ready as possible.

-Yes, sir.
-We can't control the bleeding.

617
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:57,124
[host] Dr. Sergio Pessina
is a neurosurgeon at Sapienza University.

618
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,378
He's been doing clinical trials since 2022

619
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,964
to treat brain tumors
by using CAR T-cell therapy

620
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:07,510
and has successfully completed
the trials earlier this year.

621
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:11,931
The CAR T-cell therapy enhances
the anti-cancer effects

622
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:16,977
by genetically modifying T cells
to specifically bind to cancer cells.

I just got a text from Dr. Han.

He said Haru Ichida is doing well,
so there's no need to worry.

629
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,689
Of course he is.
You know who his surgeon was.

630
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,023
[hums]

631
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,108
You're really thrilled.

632
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,361
Yeah, it's great. Everything's great.
So exciting.

Uh, I'm just out with some friends.

Mmm.

Did Dr. Choi say that?

No.

00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,650
That's what the police are saying though.

00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,206
Sure. Go ahead.

693
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,875
-Please, eat.
-No, noâ€¦

694
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,959
-Excuse me.
-After you.

695
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,086
Hi.

696
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,089
[Yang] <i>I saw the news.</i>
<i>Have you had a lot to drink?</i>

697
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,635
[sighs] Of course not. What's going on?

698
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,846
Hello, Dr. Choi.
It's me, Detective Wanil Lee.

699
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,307
Yes, Detective. How are you?

700
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,935
Hi. I'm calling about the video
I showed you before in your office.

701
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:30,439
The illegal surgery.
We actually got a tip about it recently.

702
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,151
Oh, that's good.

703
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,820
<i>Yeah, we're both on our way</i>
<i>to the scene right now.</i>

704
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,532
And I was wondering that maybe
you could come for a bit and look.

705
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,660
<i>It's not that far from Busan.</i>

706
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,037
I can do that. Sure.

707
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,747
Text me the address.

708
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:10,938
[Dr. Choi] <i>Seok did that?</i>

709
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,150
[in Japanese] Yes. But on one condition.

710
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:21,573
One that's unfair to me, I suppose.

711
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,955
To be honest,
I want to take her up on her offer,

712
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,748
butâ€¦

713
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,876
But what?

714
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,381
I'm not sure if I can trust her
to operate on my son.

715
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,925
[sighs] I can't decide.

716
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,680
I can vouch for her.

717
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,185
I think you should give her a chance.

718
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,240
[in English] What?

719
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,325
Come to see me humiliated?

720
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,453
Are you satisfied?

721
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,249
Did Ms. Ichida tell you everything?

722
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,834
Yeah, I heard.

723
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,045
You somehow finished in four hours.

724
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,173
Actually, it was three hours, 49.

725
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,257
Not bad.

726
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,261
I would've done it faster at your age.

727
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,598
-But anyway, you did good work.
-[scoffs]

728
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,686
Guess who I ran into earlier?

729
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,689
Myeongjin Kim's son was outside the venue.

730
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,693
Oh, Kiyoung.

731
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:41,862
He came here too?

732
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,657
Apparently, his dad went missing.
Did you hear?

733
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,035
Just a month after his discharge.

734
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,037
Yeah, I heard he ran off somewhere.

735
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,498
So tell me, what did you do?

736
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,542
[sighs] You know that some people
have mental health issues

737
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,503
after a major surgery like that.

738
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,134
What? What?

739
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,472
You killed him.

740
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,724
[scoffs]

741
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,352
What reason would I have
for killing my own friend?

742
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,773
[snickers] Yeah,
he's your friend, isn't he?

743
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:22,361
You know, I thought about it.
And guess what I realized?

744
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:26,823
The reason you decided to send Uyeong
to Boston instead of me all of a sudden.

745
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,536
It wasn't because his family bribed you,
was it?

746
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,205
It was all because I saved him.

747
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,334
I saved the patient
you were trying to kill.

748
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,420
So I had to suffer, right?

749
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,675
From that moment on,
you couldn't stand the sight of me, huh?

750
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,471
[Seok scoffs]

751
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,266
[Dr. Choi scoffs]

752
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,600
[vehicle approaches]

753
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,185
Pathetic.

754
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,772
[shouting] Did you murder Myeongjin Kim?

755
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,150
[door opens, closes]

756
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,249
[scoffs]

757
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,470
DELUXE

758
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,849
Thank you so much for coming. This way.

759
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,551
[barking]

760
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,435
[Yang] Kind of spooky, isn't it?

761
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,771
[Dr. Choi] So how did you find this place?

762
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,232
Min, the broker.
I'm sure you've heard of him, right?

763
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:30,447
'Cause brain operations
are one thing we don't touch.

764
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,158
[Yang] He got scared and ran to China.

765
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,744
But he called me out of the blue
before he left.

766
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,954
He said he only deals
with livers and kidneys

767
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,373
but never any brains though.

768
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:43,585
[scoffs] Something had that asshole
shaken to the core.

769
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,839
Anyway, he claimed there'd be a ton
of evidence here, so here we are.

770
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,257
Did he say more?

771
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,552
-What do you mean?
-No, nothing.

772
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:56,223
[sighs] Just thinking out loud.

773
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,521
[Yang] They must've
cleared this place out already.

774
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,981
It's clean, unlike the other spots.

775
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,900
Something definitely happened here.

776
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,737
[Dr. Choi] This doesn't look
like the place from the video.

777
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,365
It was an office, wasn't it?

778
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,742
Well, according to Min,

779
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,287
there are all sorts of guys who are
willing to do black market brain surgery.

780
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,417
Those bastards.
Any one of them could've been here.

781
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,391
So what do you need me to do?

782
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,687
I need evidence that this place
was used for brain surgery.

783
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,315
Help me find something. Anything.

784
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,902
You're the expert, so I figured
you'd notice things that I might miss.

785
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,113
There's no electricity here.

786
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,574
In this darkness,

787
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,660
even if Hua Tuo
couldn't perform brain surgery.

788
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:02,456
[officer] Inspector!

789
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:13,049
-[shovels scraping]
-[officers panting]

790
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,434
Here it is.

791
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:28,857
Sir.

792
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,276
Here.

793
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,360
[grunts]

794
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,535
[sighs]

795
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,345
[gasps]

796
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,270
Go on, then.

797
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,120
[gasps]

798
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,846
[Yang sighs] This just got complicated.
