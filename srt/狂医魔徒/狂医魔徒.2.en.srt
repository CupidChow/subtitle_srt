<i>Early entrance to college? At what age?</i>

00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,599
[doctor] <i>Seventeen.</i>
<i>Top score on the entrance exam.</i>

21
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,686
-[Dr. Choi] <i>She must be smart.</i>
-[doctor] <i>Yeah, she's smart.</i>

22
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,439
<i>But so what? She's a loose cannon.</i>

23
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,691
<i>My advice? Watch out for her.</i>

24
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,152
[Dr. Choi]
<i>So this Seok Jeong is that bad, huh?</i>

25
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,072
I just got back and this is
the very first thing you had to tell me.

26
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,033
Believe me,
that's how much trouble she is.

27
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,743
Something's wrong with her.

28
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
And she talks way too much.

29
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,873
She talks too much?

30
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,082
I'm serious.

31
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,335
Once she gets going… [chuckles]
…she'll talk for an hour.

32
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,881
She's got so much to talk about
and complain about.

33
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,757
And she's a know-it-all.

34
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,301
Sounds like a handful.

35
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,637
Yeah, she definitely is.
But she's also good at what she does.

36
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,097
She pushes herself hard.

37
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,642
You're acting like all hell's broken loose
'cause of this kid.

38
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,062
I had a bad feeling when I read her essay.

39
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,482
What did it say?

40
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,276
[chuckles] Read it when you get a chance.

41
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
-Oh! Dr. Choi!
-Ah… Ms. Na.

42
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,370
Oh, it's been so long.

43
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,997
[gasps]

44
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,125
Wait. I heard you were still in Boston.

45
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,085
[gasps] Are you back for good now?

46
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,129
-Yes. I'm back for good.
-[gasps]

47
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,422
How have you been?

48
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,341
[gasps] Oh my goodness.

49
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,426
I'm so happy to see you, I'm crying.

50
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,473
-Oh…
-So, how are your knees? They holding up?

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,100
Oh, you know,
I'm just trying to go easy on them.

52
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,275
[doctor] Come on, eat first.
I'll help you out after.

53
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,485
Don't worry about me.

54
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,694
Hmm…

55
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,404
[knocks on door]

56
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,114
Come in.

57
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,616
[knocks louder]

58
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,535
Uh… It's open. Come in.

59
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,619
[clears throat]

60
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,330
[knocking]

61
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
Huh?

62
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,667
Seok Jeong.

63
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,635
-Dr. Choi.
-Huh?

64
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,145
[laughs]

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,528
Residents must have a lot of free time
these days,

66
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,238
seeing as how you're not in the ward.

67
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,825
-Today is my day off.
-If you're off, you should rest.

68
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,244
Your eyes are even red.

69
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,746
That doesn't matter.

70
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,832
Who cares about sleep?

71
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,558
There has to be a reason
you've barged into a professor's office

72
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,685
without any kind of formal introduction.

73
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,022
I heard that you were back in Korea.

74
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,691
I ran all the way here
because I wanted to show you this.

75
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,111
It's this week's neuro quiz.

76
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,450
If you look along the neuraxis
here and here,

77
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,951
three-millimeter tumors.

78
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,995
Two of them.

79
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,830
They're Chordomas, right?

80
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,855
When Dr. Song was with you,

81
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,774
he'd talk smack about me, huh?

82
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,443
Did he tell you I'm a weirdo?

83
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,736
'Cause it's not true.

84
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,532
Honestly, I don't like him
that much either.

85
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,035
He yawns in the operating room.

86
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,037
Not to mention his research papers.

87
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,005
I've read them all, ya know.
And not one was worth reading.

88
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,175
He pieces together other people's work.

89
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,721
So you dare talk about Dr. Song like that
in front of me?

90
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,309
Dr. Song, he used
to be your student, right?

91
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,019
Like me.

92
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,189
Like you?

93
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
Yeah.

94
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,152
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for you.

95
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,739
I've been waiting for you
to come back from Boston.

96
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,157
Every day.

97
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,952
Since before I even graduated
from med school.

98
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,914
Every one of your papers, all,
all of your research,

99
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,084
I've read all of it.
Hmm. I even memorized a few.

100
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,545
That's a waste of your time though.

101
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,130
Why do that?

102
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,551
Every single word is perfection.

103
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,052
So it's not a waste.

104
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,809
[Dr. Choi clears throat]

105
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,418

YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

108
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,263
Dr. Choi!

109
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,353
Seok Jeong?

110
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,438
What is it?

111
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,525
Please teach me, doctor.

112
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,777
You're the only one I want to learn from.

113
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,573
-Really?
-I want you to teach me everything please.

114
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,992
Everything you've ever learned!

115
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,161
Every surgical skill in your head!

116
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,996
If you know it, I want it.

117
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,668
Don't keep anything to yourself.
Don't hold anything back from me.

118
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,753
Please teach me everything.

119
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,007
And why would I do that?

120
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
Doctor.

121
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,638
I have staked

122
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,100
my entire life on this.

123
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,689
[Dr. Choi] <i>I should've seen it</i>
<i>right then and there.</i>

124
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,109
<i>She had absolutely no self-control.</i>

125
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,069
<i>She was all over the place.</i>

126
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,906
<i>In the end, she said</i>
<i>her dream was to die while operating.</i>

127
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,617
<i>I know exactly what that feels like.</i>

128
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,995
[Ms. Ra] <i>What?</i>

129
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,333
-It's love.
-Oh, my. [chuckles]

130
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,835
She was in love with you?

131
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,504
[laughs] Yeah, right.

132
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,883
No, not with me.

133
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,677
With this right here.

134
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,638
I was just like her at that age.

135
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,644
While my classmates were busy
obsessing over girls, I was in the OR.

136
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,147
I was falling in love

137
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
with brain surgery.

138
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,194
I was captivated by the brain.

139
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,073
That's amazing actually.
You and she are so similar.

140
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,745
You have never seen a brain, have you?

141
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,913
Only in pictures.

142
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,832
You can't understand what I mean
unless you see it.

143
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,213
The human brain, it pulsates,
just like the heart.

144
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,174
You've gotta see it for yourself.

145
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,811
<i>You see, the brain's not an organ</i>
<i>you're meant to cut open.</i>

146
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,397
<i>It doesn't have a lid.</i>

147
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,690
[chuckles]

148
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>That's how it was designed,</i>

149
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,654
<i>for no one to open it.</i>

150
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,324
<i>But I was lucky enough to look inside.</i>

151
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,871
<i>It was so delicate and fragile,</i>

152
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,499
<i>yet at the same time,</i>

153
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,085
<i>incredibly beautiful and elegant.</i>

154
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,420
[sighs]

155
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,090
You can't help but fall in love with it.

156
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,802
Once it's gone, you miss it
and want to touch it again.

157
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,596
So to die in the OR, that's what you want?

158
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,474
Yeah. I'd be happy to.

159
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,809
Wow.

160
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,688
So that girl, you seem to like her a lot.

161
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,482
What? Like her?

162
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,568
[clicks tongue] Disgraceful.

163
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,113
-[chuckles]
-[phone ringing]

164
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,910
Hello, Dr. Kang.

HAN HYEONHO'S
ANESTHESIOLOGY & PAIN MEDICINE

166
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,171
Thank you.

167
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,534
From what I hear, you only treat patients
everyone else has given up on.

168
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,913
[Dr. Han sighs] Yes, those are usually
the kinds of patients who come to us.

169
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,043
Since what you're doing is illegal,

170
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,879
why not charge them more money then?

171
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,799
I charge them what's fair,
given their situations.

172
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,011
MEDICAL VOLUNTEER SERVICE

173
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,806
You charge them a fair amount,
and your clinic looks like this?

174
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,099
[chuckles]

175
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,226
That's a bit of a mystery.

176
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,025
[sighs]

177
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,654
Oh.

178
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,283
Dr. Baul Yoon was your professor, huh?

179
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,620
I heard he hit some rough patches
towards the end,

180
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,998
living off one of his students
because he had nowhere else to go.

181
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,000
Tragic, really.

182
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,127
You're mistaken, Doctor.

183
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,839
Dr. Yoon was more dignified
and more at peace than anyone.

184
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,383
Even in his remaining days.

185
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,932
You're headed for a sad ending.
Just like your professor, I guess. Hmm?

186
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,894
Looking after the rejects
in this tiny little clinic.

187
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,647
It's a waste of your time and talent.

188
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,822
So you're one of those
who look down on the less fortunate.

189
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,325
Now that
I've gotten a little older, Doctor,

190
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,703
it's harder to tolerate people
who think my work here is worthless.

191
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,582
I'm really sick of hearing
that kind of talk.

192
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,253
Couldn't agree more.

193
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,131
No job is fun all the time.

194
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,134
That's rare, you know. Hmm?

195
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,017
This is not the kind of case
you should bring to us.

196
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,229
You should do the operation yourself.

197
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,940
It would be ideal
if I could do it, of course.

198
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,901
Yet, I can't operate on myself, can I?

199
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,786
Dr. Han.

200
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,122
Oh, thank you.

201
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,833
How are your studies by the way?

202
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,794
Maybe I'm stupid.

203
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,255
All of the English, it's really hard,
you know?

204
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,798
[slams]

205
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,885
I won't do it. Just let him die.

206
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,597
-[Dr. Han] Dr. Jeong.
-I already said I won't.

207
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,183
Why the hell are you pushing this on me?

208
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,977
Maybe I just hate to see you
wasting your talent like this.

209
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,396
Yeah. This is a waste of my talent.

210
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,649
I'd be happy to just keep being
the only one who gets to see your work.

211
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,443
But it wouldn't be fair.

212
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,655
You have to do it.
That's the right thing to do.

213
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,412
You need everyone to see what you can do.

214
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,583
You can't keep sneaking around different
hospitals for the rest of your life,

215
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,210
like some thief in the night.

216
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,921
Dr. Choi said if you do this,

217
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,132
he'll talk to the medical board
and get your license reinstated, so--

218
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,800
So I get my license back, and what?

219
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,345
Open up a local clinic or something?

220
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,765
What the hell do you think
I could possibly do there?

221
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,517
All I would be telling my patients is

222
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,936
"Go to the hospital."

223
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,274
I'm fine where I am right now.
I like things the way they are.

224
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,318
You understand?

Ms. Seok, wait.
What are you doing with all that stuff?

228
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,087
I'm going to burn this shit.

229
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,880
All of it!

230
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,344
-[exclaims]
-What is all this?

231
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,305
There's another box in the storage room.

232
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,266
-Go get it.
-But Ms. Seok.

233
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,642
Go get it now!

00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,234

'Cause you look like something's wrong.

You need more alcohol swabs?

247
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,407
What happened the other day?

248
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,286
That guy who was with you,
he ended up in an ambulance.

249
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,081
I mean,
he collapsed right in front of you,

250
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,958
but you didn't even look at him.

251
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,670
[chuckles] And what the hell
were you stomping on so hard?

252
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,881
You know, something tells me

253
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,966
you're not like other women.

254
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,973
So what?

255
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,728
Oh, nothing.

I don't know what that was all about

258
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,610
but I figure you must be pissed
about something.

259
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,575
I could take you to Seoul.

260
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,494
How about a drink, huh?

261
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,037
Just the two of us.

262
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,083
And why would I get a drink with you?

263
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,046
Oh, what, is it 'cause of this?

264
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,090
But they'll be taking this off
in a couple days.

265
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,468

I can't even imagine having a brother
who hits you.

00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,484
I'm gonna take my lunch break now, okay?

283
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,444
Lunch break? Where?

284
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,197
-Where else? Mari's Diner.
-[Mari shouts]

285
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,244
[coworker] Wait a sec. He's beating her
out front, are you serious?

286
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,706
He's more likely to stop
if I go over there. I'm a customer.

287
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,541
[Mari whimpering] Please stop.

288
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,959
[stammers] Wait for me!

289
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,355
That creep, he's showing us
his ankle on purpose, right?

290
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,984
He's just trying to get us to look at him,
you know. That's all.

291
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,832
Thank you, Ms. Mari.

292
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,504
Did you get a good look at her face?
We should go ahead and call the police.

293
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,007
What will calling them even do?

294
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,344
She'll just tell them she fell again.
Just ignore it.

[footsteps approaching]

296
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,770

297
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,188
It's not for you.

298
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,272
It's for her.

299
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,233
-Have a taste.
-I don't really eat mackerel.

300
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,818
Oh, come on.

301
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,195
It's on the house.

302
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,910
Why's he acting like this all of a sudden?

303
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,498
He's completely fearless, that's why.

304
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,500

[Dr. Han] <i>Dr. Jeong,</i>
<i>can you operate tonight?</i>

00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,264
[whispering] Yes. Absolutely.

<i>Dr. Kang brought in the case.</i>

310
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,727
The patient has a diffuse midline glioma.

311
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,522
He was discharged from Daeseo Hospital
after six months.

312
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,817
Send over the chart. See you there.

I am that you're doing this,

[Ms. Na] <i>Of course I remember.</i>

330
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,183
That day Dr. Jeong,
for the first time ever,

331
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,602
took the lead on a surgery.

332
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,107
I was so nervous assisting her
during the procedure.

333
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,692
But

334
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,027
she was perfect.

335
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,863
[chuckles]

336
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,032
I guess she was a genius already.

337
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,201
She was a genius for sure…

338
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,413
but also a fool.

339
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,874
I wish…

340
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:47,958
Hello.

341
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,253
-<i>…Dr. Choi had chosen to send Dr. Jeong…</i>
-Is Dr. Choi's schedule posted yet?

342
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,505
-<i>…to Boston back then.</i>
-Wait. What?

343
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,090
<i>Things wouldn't have turned out this way.</i>

344
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,426
[Uyeong] Weren't you off today?
What were you doing in the OR?

345
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,553

for an emergency.

346
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,764
-[Uyeong sighs] Dr. Song drunk again?
-Yeah.

347
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,393
Stop agreeing to cover for him whenever
he calls you, before it ruins your health.

348
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,728
[clicks tongue] No, it's fine.

349
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,606
I'll gladly cover for him if that means
I get to be in the OR again.

350

Don't do that to yourself.

351

-Wow.

00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,425
If it's for two years,
it must cost quite a bit.

361

-[resident 4] Exactly.
-Is it for a year?

Can't you see I have company?

369

You said you were gonna send
the one most qualified though.

370
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,698
-Maybe you've forgotten already.
-We'll talk about this later. Now get out!

that complete idiot to Boston right now!

Apologize to Uyeong's mother.

374
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,632
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were his mother.

375
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,511
Nevertheless, you're also at fault here.

376
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,680
This is all thanks to you buying my spot
for your son.

377
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,099
You're so educated but you have
no problem stooping that low.

378
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,059
-Seok Jeong, get a hold of yourself!
-Why?

379
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,936
-What is wrong with you?
-What the hell do you expect

380
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,188

390

She was treated like she was invisible

391
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,247
until the incident.

392
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,126
While Dr. Choi was away
at some conference,

393
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,589
the department head gave Dr. Jeong
permission to operate on a patient.

394
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,009
That was a bad idea, wasn't it?

395
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,901
Seok Jeong, stop it.

396
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,153
Stop what you're doing!

397
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,833
Damn it, I said stop now!

398
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,635
Hey, you heard him.

399
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,303
Don't make a scene. Just walk away.

400
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,559
[sighs]

401
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,023
I got paged to the ER.
Car accident victim.

402
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,150
We did a full-body scan
and found multiple trauma,

403
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,069
including fractures and bleeding all over.

404
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,115
CT and MRI scans were ordered
and they showed an acute SDH.

405
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,367
The patient clearly needed
emergency surgery,

406
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,119
but there was no one else available.

407
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,788
So I did it myself.

408
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,624
I performed a transfusion,
removed any hematomas,

409
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,835
found the source of the bleeding
and stopped the hemorrhage.

410
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,295
I've been operating for two hours
and 20 minutes.

411
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,422
The patient's vitals are stable.

412
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,883
And all that's left to do now is suction
and close them up.

413
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,387
I haven't made a single mistake
throughout the procedure.

414
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,724
So why should I get out of my own OR

415
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,352
when my patient's still lying here
on the table?

416
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,479
So you did nothing wrong?
You refuse to leave?

417
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,398
-Yeah.
-Get her out.

418
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,317
I said out!

419
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,531
Get off.

420
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,657
-No!
-That's enough!

421
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,242
-This is my surgery!
-Hey, Seok!

422
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,451
-Mine!
-Seok!

423
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,995

Dr. Kang is gone, isn't he?

427
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,349
He's nowhere to be found
and he's not answering his phone either.

428
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,644
This is strange. It isn't like him.

429
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,856
I bet there was never any patient
to begin with.

430
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,858
We should go now.

from performing surgeries, huh?

433
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,338
I did it for you.

434
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,383
I got you a spot at Boston University.

435
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,387
Apparently, getting your license back
just wasn't enough for you.

436
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,432
Go to Boston.

437
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,517
Just go.

438
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,478
And perform all the surgeries you want.

439

-And in exchange I have to operate on you?
-Why not?

440

It wouldn't even be that hard for you.

441

Let's say I agree to do it.

442
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,699
If I nick even one little nerve, you know,

443
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,827

I hate you.

448
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,431
I'd make that mistake 'cause I hate you.

Wasting away.

Reminiscing about your glory days

460
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,919
thinking "Wow, I used to be someone."

461
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,380
Listen to you rattle on and on.

462
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,507
You really have no self-control.

00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,426
Do you?

464
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,262
You are going to save my life

465
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,056
and go to Boston after.

466
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,727
I'm gonna make sure of it.

467
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,400
Let's go.

After all that drama,

472
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,680
I feel sick.

You still want her to do it?

She really didn't seem
on board with it all.

I mean, you heard what she said.

476
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,406
What if she opens you up and

477
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,075
-you know?
-What? Just kills me?

478
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,536
Well, she's not exactly normal, is she?

479
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,871

480
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,332

00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,991
I saved your life. So show some gratitude.

521
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,493
-[groaning]
-[door opens]

522
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,087
He's doing that in front of me
on purpose, right?

523
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,550
What's he up to?
I'm starting to get really worried.

524
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,596
I've got enough to stress over as it is.
This guy…

525
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,350
Hey, listen. Listen.

526
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,104
Why don't we just go get jjajangmyeon
right about now instead?

527
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,816
No way.

528
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,318
It's stir-fried pork day, after all.

529
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,796
[phone buzzing]

530
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,467
Daddy!

531
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,595
Daddy!

532
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,186
[buzzing continues]

533
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,109
Dr. Choi.

534
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,320
<i>Alan. Is this a bad time?</i>

535
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,863
No, don't worry about it.

536
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,823
<i>When will you be here?</i>

537
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,659
<i>Will I see you at the Ichida Awards?</i>

538
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,997
Ah… Unfortunately I don't think I can go.
I actually have a surgery scheduled.

539
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,081
<i>You do?</i>

540
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,669
I only have one vial left
of the Ceralib-A.

541
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,922
[Alan sighs]

542
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,050
-<i>What will you do?</i>
-Well, I'll have to stretch it out.

543
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,927
<i>How bad are your symptoms?</i>

544
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,679
They're all right.

545
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,141
I can manage with the patches for now.

546
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,312
It's just a bit worrying.

547
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,858
<i>Okay, I'll let you know</i>
<i>as soon as I'm able to book a flight.</i>

548
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,568
I appreciate it.

549
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,154
[line clicks]

550
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,706
[coughs]

551
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,714
You watching a drama?

552
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,008
Yeah.

553
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,010
Is it any good?

554
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,178
[sharply inhales]

555
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,263
[groans]

556
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,557
Hey, look at this.

557
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,601
[grunts] I don't want to.

558
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,894
Just look!

559
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,355
[sighs] That's gross!

560
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
What?

561
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,535
Dr. Choi's surgery,

562
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,620
is it that hard?

563
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,330
Yeah, it's in an awful spot.

564
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,374
But you love that kind of stuff.

565
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,670
[sighs] I feel for him.
He's not exactly young.

566
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,547
Poor guy.

567
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,134
Everyone dies when they get old.

568
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,011
Why do you care?

569
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,263
Ms. Seok, don't--

570
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,961
[dogs barking]

571
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,357
[scoffs]

572
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,237
All right, I see.

573
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,407
[gunshot]

574
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,993
[hunter sighs]

575
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,087
Oh, Mr. Kang, good evening.
Mr. Pak, you're out and about too.

576
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,963
-Yeah.
-Coming back from your hunt?

577
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:15,176
[sighs] We struck out. A big one ran off
this way. Did you see it?

578
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,887
No. If it came around here,
my dogs would've let you know.

579
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,223
[sighs] That was a big one.

580
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,225
So are you busy these days?

581
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,977
-Why?
-You should hunt wild boars.

582
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,355
The reward 300,000 won per head now.

583
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,190
-Come show off a bit.
-[door opens]

584
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,275
Yeah. I've been thinking about
getting out there soon.

585
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,820
I heard one of them wrecked
Grandma Jinju's ginseng farm.

586
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,655
That's not the only placed they trashed.

587
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,033
My family gravesite too.
We might have to move the graves.

588
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,910
-Oh, jeez.
-Good evening.

589
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,705
Hey! Long time no see! [chuckles]

590
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,792
Oh, right. You said
you wanted to expand your pharmacy.

591
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,753
-Thought about relocating?
-Do you know of a good location?

592
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,672
Right across the street. Mari's Diner.

593
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,551
Her brother won't stop beating her
for money, so she has no choice.

594
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,595
She's selling her restaurant to get him
some cash and be done with it.

595
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,722
Oh, man. That's too bad.

596
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,476
I see you going into Mari's Diner
every day. So now what?

597
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,894
[chuckles]

598
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,105
It's not the only restaurant, silly.

599
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,735
FOR LEASE

600
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,447
[Seo] Ms. Seok, calm down. There are
plenty of other places we can go to eat.

601
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,200
MARI'S DINER

602
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,245
It's not like you're gonna starve to death
just 'cause the diner's closing.

603
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,498
Why is everyone doing this to me?

604
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,960
That restaurant is mine.

605
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,629
I don't deserve this.
I mean, it's my restaurant!

606
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,756
Stop it already. It's not yours!

607
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,927
I'm gonna murder this guy.

608
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,139
Oh, come on. Not again!

609
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,809
No way. I can't let you do it.

610
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,604
Why do you keep trying to kill people?

611
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,440
Why can't I kill him?
Give me one good reason.

612
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,609
-Well, obviously--
-You know me.

613
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,987
Telling me "Because you're not
supposed to" won't stop me.

614
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,785
You know I actually have exams
this whole week.

615
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,996
-You're done tomorrow.
-Just with Intro to Nursing.

616
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,957
I still have Basic Anatomy
and IV Injection Skills.

617
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,709
So what?

618
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,253
You're busy?

619
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,838
Is that it?

620
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,632
Yes.

621
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,803
Okay.

622
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,639
Prioritize your studies.

623
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,808
I'll have to make peace with it.

624
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:29,894
Wait, really?

625
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,112
[engine starts]

626
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,897
[Mari] Welcome.

627
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,778
What can I get you?

628
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,406
-[patron] Ah… Two specials, please.
-Coming right up.

629
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,160
-[patron] Can we have some more water?
-Of course.

630
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,664
Here you are.

631
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,596

[clears throat]

633
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,941
Have you thought about it?

634
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,028
About what?

635
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,947
Ah… You know.
Getting drinks with me in Seoul.

636
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,493
I don't know.

637
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,120
Hey.

638
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:57,708
A tough girl like yourself
gotta be going out with a guy like me.

639
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,044
You see it too.

640
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,962
You and me,

641
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,715
we're meant to be.

642
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,762
Ah… But you're a high class pharmacist,
I get it.

643
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,225
So people are gonna have a lot to say
about the two of us dating, aren't they?

644
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,937
[sighs] I've already thought
all this through, you know.

645
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,482
No more ankle monitor.

646
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,902
That makes things a little easier for us.
Don't you agree?

647
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,908
The monitor's finally off.

648
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,246
I should buy you a drink to celebrate.

649
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,497
How's tomorrow?

650
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,417
Um…

651
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,505
Well, then.

652
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,424
I hope it's not raining tomorrow.

653
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,759
I know, right?

[sighs] It's so hot out.

656
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,089
You want a drink?

657
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Hmm?

658
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,345
Aw… You didn't have to. [chuckles]

659
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:19,808
[sighs] So good.

660
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,895
Well, I made it just for you.

661
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,989
-[Seok] Come on in.
-Hmm? Yeah.

662
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,175
-[Seok] Bring it in here.
-[grunts] Okay.

663

Okay.

Man, this is…

665
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,018
What were you gonna do
if I wasn't here to help you?

666

[grunts]

667
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,233
Aw. You're looking kinda tired.

668
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,235
Sit down for a minute.

669
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:14,697
Here.

00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,160
Hey, take off your jacket. It's dirty.

Be back in a sec.

What the heck
are you still doing up so late?

692
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,115
[Seok] Good question.

693
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,910
What am I still doing up so late?

Yeah. It just happened.

697
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,756
