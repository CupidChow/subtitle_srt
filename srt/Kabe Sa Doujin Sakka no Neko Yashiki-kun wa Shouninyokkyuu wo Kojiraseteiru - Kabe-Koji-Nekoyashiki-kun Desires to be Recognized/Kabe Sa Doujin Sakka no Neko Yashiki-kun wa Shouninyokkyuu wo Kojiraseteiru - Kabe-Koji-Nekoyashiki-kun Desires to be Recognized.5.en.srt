- There isn't any.

- It's got nothing to do with you--
- You know it isn't true.

51
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,160
That article is rubbish.

52
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,110
A groundless accusation?

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,500
He wasn't a violent troublemaker. It's a lie.

- Shut up!

61

If you're so free to bother about outsiders, go brush up on singing and dancing--

You're not an outsider!

63

We all want to help you out.

67
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,560
But we can't help you if we don't know anything.

68

There's nothing we can do.

what actually happened.

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,820
Why should I tell you guys?

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,050
The reason is obvious.

73
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,840
We belong to the same group, that's why.

74
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,620
We boarded the same ship, we'll be together whether it sails or sinks.

75
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,970
We're bound by the same fate.

91
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,050

<i>Nah, I'm just keeping you company.</i>

104
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,660
- <i>I'm not the idol type of guy, anyway. 
 - Yes, yes.</i>

105
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,900
<i>What do you mean by "yes, yes"?</i>

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,620

<i>I don't know what's going on, but I'm glad.</i>

<i>Aiming to be an idol is embarrassing.</i>

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,570
<i>It's such a lame dream,</i>

131
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,340
<i>and so uncool, it's better to give up the idea.</i>

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,550
<i>You can't be one, anyway.</i>

<i>In our futures...</i>

139
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,600
<i>it should have become a reality.</i>

140
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,110
<i>Huh?</i>

141
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,150
<i>What're you talking about? It's gross.</i>

142
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,570
<i>What the hell do you know?!</i>

143
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,610

144
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,480

145
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,330

<i>You're lying.</i>

148
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,740
<i>You're definitely lying!</i>

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,230
<i>You actually enjoyed it.</i>

150
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,310
<i>You were seriously thinking of becoming one.</i>

151
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,340
<i>But...</i>

152
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,230
<i>You'll just feel more terrible if I dance.</i>

153
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,620
<i>Of course it feels terrible.</i>

154
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,250
<i>If I see you dance and sing,</i>

155
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,330
<i>I'd certainly feel really terrible.</i>

156
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,230
<i>That's why.</i>

157
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,470
<i>But if you quit now,</i>

158
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,880
<i>whenever I see you, I'll feel that I was the one who made you quit, and I hate that!</i>

159
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,330
<i>Then...</i>

160
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,610
<i>Then what do you want me to do?!</i>

161
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,240
<i>Make me give up.</i>

162
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,730
<i>Become a top idol, to the point that I'll think, "Even if I become one,"</i>

163
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,500
<i>"I can never get to where you are".</i>

164
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,440
<i>And when that time comes,</i>

165
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,800
<i>I'll become the Number One fan of the Number One idol in Japan.</i>

166
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,680
<i>You just want your way, don't you?</i>

167
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,010
<i>You're always like that.</i>

168
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,950
You're a super nice guy!

169
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,510
Even with that bad attitude of yours, you're such a nice guy!

170
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,790
I'm sorry for thinking you're a piece of shit.

171
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,670
You thought I was a piece of shit?

172
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,100
But... you were acting all high and mighty.

173
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,810
But so what if I've told you all this?

174
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,910
The situation hasn't changed.

175
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,370
What?

176
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,620
We like you even more now.

177
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,670
After knowing what happened, we like you even more.

178
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,180
- So what are you getting at?
- It's a big deal.

179
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,930
We know what to do, moving forward.

180
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,130
Huh? What are you talking about--

181
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,440
You did all this for your brother, didn't you?

182
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,060
That's why... you planned to shoulder all this burden yourself.

183
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,960
If that's the case, we're going to shoulder it too.

184
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,720
Let us shoulder it with you together.

185
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,660
What?

186
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,540
Let us shoulder it!

187
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,030
- Let us shoulder it! Let us shoulder it!
- Ouch, that hurts!

188
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,070
- Let us shoulder it!
- It hurts!

189
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,170
This is called hammering!

190
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,130
Hey, wait! Help me!

191
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,510
You called me a piece of shit.

192
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,370
I'll teach you a lesson.

193
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,390
Help me! Wait!

194
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,820
Alright, alright...

195
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,580
Once again... sorry for causing you all this trouble.

196
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,700
Don't worry about such things.

197
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm happy to see you after so long.

198
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,720
Besides, now I know you have a group of such good friends.

199
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,380
They're no big deal when compared to me.

200
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,660
What an insolent brat.

201
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,460
- Agreed.
- That's how he is.

202
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,490
Anyway, thank you for taking the trouble to come down here.

203
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,980
If there's something I can do to express my gratitude...

204
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,340
Oh...

205
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,670
Well... erm...

206
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,860
Alright, say "cheese".

207
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,030
I'm happy to take a photo with you.

208
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,340
So... happy...

209
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,270
I'm so...

210
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,660
Gosh!

211
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,320
<i>[Chuo Television]</i>

212
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,840
None of them posted on their blogs yesterday, right?

213
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,420
This is worrying.

214
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,380
I thought Tsubasa would have stepped forward to say something.

215
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,540
It's great that most of the dust seems to have settled.

216
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,720
After we posted the written apology, your classmate stepped forward.
<i>[He didn't beat me up.]</i>

217
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,560
That was a huge turning point.
<i>[I couldn't accept the fact that he had a dream.]</i>

218
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,290
<i>[That article is not true.]</i>

219
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,180
It's harder to spread good news than bad news,

220
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,980
but we somehow did it.

221
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,740
But it's my fault that we had to apologize.

222
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,310
Hey...

223
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,020
Can I address them on my own first?

224
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,780
No, you can't.

225
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,370
Let's go. Together.

226
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,910
Thanks.

227
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,540
For making all of you worry lately,

228
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,080
we are very sorry about it.

229
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,690
To regain your trust in us,

230
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,100
we'll start all over again and do even better.

231
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,990
I believe the recent incident has hurt the hearts of many Tsubacchi fans.

232
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,600
Tsubacchi, too, was actually very depressed about it,

233
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,560
and almost had a mental breakdown.

234
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,900
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

235
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,430
- This wasn't part of the script... 
 - Not part of it.

236
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,430
That's why, to all our fans, please look on the bright side.

237
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,060
Tsubacchi has realized how terrible it feels to face public criticism.

238
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,980
Moving forward, he will DEFINITELY try not to get involved in any scandals.

239
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,130
I did it!

240
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,610
You--

241
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,900

242

Thank you.

258

Manager Katagiri, where's the wrap-up party held at?

259
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,720
Don't take off your clothes here!

260
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,010
You were having fun on stage.

261

Really? I looked cool.

262

As expected of a top idol.

263
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,780
I'm still not at the top yet.

264
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,000
- Good work.
- Good work!

265
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,500
- Ready, and "Shiny". 
 - "Shiny"!

266
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,570
- Hey you!
- One more time, please.

267
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,440
"Shiny"!

268

270
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,200
You were there throughout the whole filming, right?

271
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,060
There's a wrap-up party after this. Care to join us?

272
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,400
Huh?

273
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,670
Nah. I don't have a reason to be there.

274
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,320
Everyone will wonder who the heck I am.

275
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,160
What? Don't say that.

276

Besides, you were the one who helped us solve the problem.

277
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,740
What? I didn't do anything.

278
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,240
If you hadn't given me a push,

279
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,420
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

We all know that drawing manga is a pain.

318
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,510
Well... Forget that I asked. Just do your best.

319
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,410
Yeah.

320
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,040
<i>Nekoyashiki, you really did your best, didn't you?</i>

321
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,120
<i>I'm sure many people will want to get their hands on it.</i>

322
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,010
<i>In the next episode, a long queue shows up at ComiKing! See you ther--!</i>

323
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,900
<i>See you ther--!</i>

324
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>[Email Notice: List of participants for the 82nd Comic Kingdom]</i>

325
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,320
Yamada...

326
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
Can you be my salesperson again?

327
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,570
You've received the participants list for ComiKing?

328
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,970
Okay, leave it to me.

329
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,070
This time...

330
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,590
I'm not on the wall.

331
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,310
<i>No way...</i>

332
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,800
The wall feels so far away.

333
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,830
Morning, Mamocchi.

334
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,640
Nothing new is coming at all!

335
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,740
Who's this guy?

336
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,750
You're making a mistake by drawing with that state of mind.

337
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,780
I'm doing it.

338
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,190
Just push on

339
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,140
and do what you feel like doing.
