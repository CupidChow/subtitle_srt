What?

149
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,510
I looked at the ComiKing layout map,

150
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,260
and you weren't along the Wall anymore.

151

It's prestigious to be along the Wall, right?

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,180
That's why I was worried you'd be feeling down,

Of course I feel frustrated. I feel frustrated to no end.

159
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,700
Thought so.

160
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,820
Doujin isn't suppose to be created

161
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,750

162
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,780
I know that already.

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,150
It's a place to create what you want, how you want.

164
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,210
I know that well and clear.

165
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,810
The goal isn't to be included in the Wall Circle, or to gather a crowd.

166
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,380
I know people will say my motives are wrong.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,260
- I know they will -
- I won't.

168
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,310
After all, I know you've been working hard

169
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,150
because you want your drawings to be seen.

170
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,700
What's wrong with working hard and hoping for a result?

171
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,770
It's totally okay to do what you feel is right.

172
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,900
All you need to do, is stick true to your convictions, Mamocchi.

173
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,550
That's exactly what I love about you.

174
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,140
W-Woah.

175
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,010
Here's some food.

176
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,380
Anyways, I'll be heading out.

177
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,600
You came only to cheer him up?

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,270
"Cheer him up"? How presumptuous.

179
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,340
That's just "a-rro-and-gance".

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,770
Well, see you later.

181
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,030
Thanks for having me.

182
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,290
No, I still haven't caught up.

183
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,850
What's with that creature? That mood?

184
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,450
- Am I the background character in a BL?
- You fool.

185
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,620
His "love" isn't like that.

186
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,310
Even so...

187
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,260
there's no doubt he gave me a push on the back.

188
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,150
I'll get back to the Wall with this new art style,

189
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,470
no matter what.

190
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,640
You must've used my "a-rro-and-gance", didn't you?

191
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,260
What do you mean "yours"?

192
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,970
Well then, bon appétit!

193
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,330
Red bean is so sweet and delicious.
<i>[Taiyaki]</i>

194
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,590
This is stuffed with it from head to tail.

195
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,170
Apparently this Taiyaki is all natural.

196
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,800
Are things going well?

197
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,590
I don't know how that works, but...

198
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,090
I've been tailing him this entire time,

199
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,580
and it's been a nightmare.

200
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,120
A nightmare?

201
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,470
Meaning you came up with nothing?

202
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,310
No, not that...

203
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,770
Good work.

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,010
Damn it...

205
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,090
He lost me.

206
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,010
Good work today sir.

207
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,700
Gonna ask me to stop and plead your privacy, eh?

208
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,620
If I did, I'd have no meals on the table!

209
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560
Sounds difficult.

210
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,540
Thanks for your hard work!

211
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,270
Here, a drink for you.

212
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,310
This heat isn't doing anyone favors.

213
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,650
Please, take it.

214
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,470
Your petty ploys won't make me stop.

215
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,330
They won't!

216
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,450
He only sent me more food, time and time again.

217
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,360
<i>[Thanks for all your hard work. Sweet things always brings me a smile. Please, have some!]</i>

218
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,310
Yes?

219
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,320
I've brought your dinner.

220
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,470
Huh?

221
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,030
Your dinner.

222
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,400
What?

223
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,960
W-Wait - !

224
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,860
Thanks a bunch.

225
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,630
<i>[Thanks for all your hard work! Here's a small snack. Good luck with the rest of work☆]</i>

226
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,540
Even I started to feel bad when sent me delivery for every meal.

227
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,180
No, that's just scary.

228
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,980
Huh? I asked to take off that specific day...

229
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,230
My apologies!

230
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,260
That was the only day they could book a shoot...

231
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,780
The crew begged me to make it work out.

232
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,530
Issei, you're all the rage nowadays.

233
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,670
How unusual.

234
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,790
You're normally eager to help out.

235
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,530
Well, that day is...

236
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,710
Who do you think you are?

237
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,790
Trying to say you're no longer a variety idol?

238
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,750
I love appearing on variety shows!

239
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,000
Then prioritize the shoot.

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600
You've been given the opportunity of solo jobs.

241
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,220
Those who let opportunity escape them, aren't pros.

242
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,320
Can't you encourage him more mildly?

243
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,510
I don't remember "encouraging" him.

244
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,240
- What'll you do? 
 - Your attitude's starting to feel cute.

245
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,630
What!?

246
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,030
I'll do it.

247
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,070
Tell them I'll be free.

248
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,140
Really!?

249
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,340
Thank you so much!

250
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,530
<i>Just the other day, I was over there...</i>

251
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,360
<i>The Wall feels so far away now...</i>

252
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,620
Oh.

253
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,320
Mr. Honeniku!

254
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,010
Squeeze!

255
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,040
- Good morning. 
 - I'm in pain.

256
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,000
Did you overwork yourself?

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,420
No, I'm physically in pain, right now.

258
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,320
Goodness me.

259
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,400
Here are some snacks, since you always look unwell.

260
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,090
It's an... assortment of dry fruits.

261
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,190
A garnish.

262
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,100
A medley.

263
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,970
Munch on them while working on your manuscript.

264
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,510
Thanks.

265
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,620
My oh my, you look extra gloomy today!

266
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,590
The gloomiest of gloom.

267
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,080
That's because...

268
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,090
I see.

269
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,870
Is this because you're not along the Wall this time?

270
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,070
Goodness gracious!

271
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,630
Sure, being along the Wall may be prestigious.

272
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,100
But that's all the Circle's organizational side of things.

273
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,000
No matter where you are, your fans will come running,

274
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,820
if you have a new book.

275
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,460
Don't be hung up on the location.

276
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,440
Just enjoy this day!

277
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,270
Seeing you has already brightened mine.

278
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
Thanks.

279
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,130
You've...

280
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,750
lifted my spirits a bit.

281
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,750
- <i>Ba-thump!</i> 
 - He's fallen for him again.

282
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,480
Goodness me, stop toying with my maidenly heart!

283
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,120
For a second I thought he'd keel over again.

284
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,660
Time's running short. Let's set up.

285
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,900
Sounds good.

286
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,780
Oh, Mr. Honeniku! Good morning!

287
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,250
As I recall, you're...

288
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,870
So you remembered again?

289
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm Takkun! One of your biggest fans!

290
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,400
General admission hasn't begun yet...

291
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,770
Ah, right.

292
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,020
To tell you the truth,

293
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,650
today commemorates my debut day!

294
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,770
Not only that, but I'm right next to you!

295
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,480
I look forwards to being neighbors today!

296

As I thought. I like you, Mamocchi.

326
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,130
Being with you is agonizing.

327
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,910
It's stressful.

328
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,200
Your "like", and my "like" are different.
