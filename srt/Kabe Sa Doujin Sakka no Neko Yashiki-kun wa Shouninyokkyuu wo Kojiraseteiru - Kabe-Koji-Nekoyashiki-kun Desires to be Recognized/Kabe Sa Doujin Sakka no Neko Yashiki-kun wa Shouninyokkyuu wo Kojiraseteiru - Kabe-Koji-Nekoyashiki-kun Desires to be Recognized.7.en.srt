What does that mean?

161
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,920
It means

162
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,950
I like you.

163
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,030
Do you understand what that implies?

164
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,940
What about your fellow Shiny Smile members?

165
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,310
- Don't you like them? 
 - Yeah, I like them.

166
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,410
You also like that journalist, this keychain, and me too.

167
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,090
You like them all, huh?

168
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,180
Your "like"

169
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,380
and my "like" are different.

170
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,180
What's so different about them?

171
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,400
Is there a difference in the way people "like"?

172
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,200
"To like" means... "to like". Right?

173
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,120
So...

174
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,530
I like you.

175
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,220
Right...

176
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,220
I guess that's how it is.

177
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,160
Yeah.

178
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,120
Mamocchi, I like you lots.

179
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,400
Thanks for always...

180
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,070
telling me...

181
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,160
you "like" me.

182
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,240
But...

183
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,970
I can't do this anymore.

184
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,390
Being with you is agonizing.

185
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,430
It hurts.

186
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,740
All this time, I never knew why it hurt so bad.

187
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,060
I thought it was because I compared us,

188
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,270
or because we were childhood friends.

189
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,610
But they were all wrong.

190
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,440
It's because you and I are different.

191
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,580
That's why it's agonizing.

192
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,480
That's why I get hurt.

193
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,610
Above anyone else, being with you...

194
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,280
Seeing your smile hurts most. It pains me,

195
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,750
It pains me, tears me apart, and scars me.

196
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,970
Is being with me...

197
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,660
that painful?

198
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,370
That's what I've...

199
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,890
been telling you.

200
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,170
I see.

201
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,610
If it hurts you that badly...

202
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,590
then...

203
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,760
we should...

204
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,700
never see each other...

205
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,320
again.

206
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,190
Good bye.

207
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,960
Yeah.

208
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,640
Good bye.

209
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,670
Hello?

210
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,800
He's... on the line.

211
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
<i>You know...</i>

212
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,460
Yeah?

213
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,230
<i>I wonder why I called you just now, Yamada.</i>

214
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,490
What?

215
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,860
<i>Erm..</i>

216
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,800
<i>what did I..</i>

217
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,730
want to tell you again?

218
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,910
I wouldn't know.

219
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,350
For starters, why don't you start talking?

220
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,220
About?

221
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,130
I guess... whatever's on your mind.

222
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,130
Even though it's late at night...

223
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,300
I'm not hungry.

224
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,830
Then don't eat.

225
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,210
<i>I want to grow taller.</i>

226
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,920
Let's leave that for your next life.

227
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,980
<i>I want to visit the South Pole.</i>

228
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,710
Win the lottery to make that one come true.

229
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,640
<i>How out of reach...</i>

230
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,160
That's seriously...

231
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,260
out of my reach.

232
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,420
Fair point.

233
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,110
Winning the lottery's no easy task.

234
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,050
<i>I was way too ambitious.</i>

235
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,100
Me, coming into contact with his life?

236
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,870
You were right.

237
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,060
He <i>was</i> beyond me to begin with.

238
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,390
I knew that from the get-go.

239
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,170
<i>Even so...</i>

240
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,980
whenever...

241
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,410
he treated me kindly...

242
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,870
I felt pain.

243
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,470
But it wasn't all pain.

244
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,290
He also made me happy.

245
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,670
Yeah.

246
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,150
I got jealous...

247
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,750
<i>Yeah.</i>

248
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,020
I longed to see him...

249
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,360
and I wanted to run.

250
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,370
Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,030
I wanted him...

252
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,120
to recog -

253
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,970
to recognize me most.

254
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,010
But I...

255
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,200
I hate myself...

256
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,220
for being like this.

257
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm sorry.

258
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,300
<i>Will we never...</i>

259
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,760
<i>This is... what I...</i>

260
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,600
<i>decided... for myself.</i>

261
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,450
<i>That's why... I must accept...</i>

262
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,020
<i>everything that comes with it.</i>
