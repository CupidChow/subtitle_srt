I'm planning to drastically change my art style.

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,520
If I don't make drastic changes,

136
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,480
I'll no longer be on the wall.

Aah! Tsubasa!

145
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,840

- Don't you crush them!

146
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,490

What do you want?

161
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,170
Stop it.

162
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,190
It's your fault that this happened.

163
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,540
So what's your problem?

164
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,560
Should I apologize and beg for forgiveness?

165
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Or maybe you guys should apologize!

166
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,110
What did we do wrong?

167
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,050
Did you even do anything?

168
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,660
If so, then show some results.

169
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,090
Wait a minute.

170
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,760

Your job!

174

If you simply want to frolic around then just quit!

175

You're crossing the line there, Tsubasa!

176

You're amazing, Kyou.

We can't be just contented with our present situation.

182
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,680
In the first place, if Tsubacchi hadn't been in our group, we wouldn't have become popular.

183
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,860
If Tsubacchi hadn't been in our group, we certainly wouldn't be able to appear on TV.

184
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,780
Kyou, Ryu, don't you agree?

185

Thank you... for always supporting us.

186

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,800
- How many times did I say to be punc--
- I'll butt into your business even if you tell me not to.

322
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,130
What?

323
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,460
I want to do something for the person I really like but I don't know anything about him.

324
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,010
A-RRO-and-GANT.

325
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,090
A-... rro-...?

326
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,730
And so, I've brought someone here.

327
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,380
What's "a-rro-and-gant"?

328
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,640
What the hell are you up to?

329
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,230
Please come in.

330
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:34,030

331
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,090
Issei's... mom?

332
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,230
<i>Nah, nah, it can't possibly be Issei's mom!</i>

333
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,850
<i>Who is this woman?</i>

334
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Seems like everyone has no idea.</i>

335
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,990
<i>Nekoyashiki... thanks to you giving Issei a push,</i>

336
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,410
<i>can Issei go "Poof!"</i>

337
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,340
<i>and cast a magic spell on everyone?</i>

338

<i>We'll know in the next episode!</i>

339
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,120
We're not outsiders, but your friends, Tsubacchi.

340
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,570
Being an idol isn't only my dream.

341
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,220
I did that because I wanted to hurt him.

342
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,730
Mamocchi is a member of "Shiny Smile".

343
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,370
Do you really enjoy drawing it?

344
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm obviously having a hard time drawing manga.
