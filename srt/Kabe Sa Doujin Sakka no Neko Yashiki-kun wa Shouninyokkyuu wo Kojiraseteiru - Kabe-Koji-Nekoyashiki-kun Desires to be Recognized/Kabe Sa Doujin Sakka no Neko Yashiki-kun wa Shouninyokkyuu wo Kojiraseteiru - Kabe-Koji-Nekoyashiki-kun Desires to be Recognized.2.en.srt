00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,900
Apologize.

164
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,190
- That's enough.
- APOLOGIZE!

165
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,010
That's enough!

166
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,980
I'll just tell you one thing.

167
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm not like you guys.

168
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,170
Me...

169
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,570
I'm going to the top, where I can shine the brightest.

170
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,930
Mr. Honeniku!

171
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,270
You were so mad and cool...

172
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,310
so what do you mean the manuscript is blank?!

173
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,110
That's why I invited you, because I wanted your advice.

174
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,440
What should I do so you can draw?!

175
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
I can't live without reading your manga!

176
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,940
What should I do?! I'll die at this rate!

177
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,920
You're too fired up!

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,020
That's why I said I wanted your advice.

179
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,390
Right! Sorry.

180
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,950
Go on.

181
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,980
This is bad.

182
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,820
The more I try to come up with characters for my new book...

183
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,790
What kind of characters are you thinking of, for example?

184
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,340
Someone with droopy boobs...

185
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,060
that look great to grope.

186
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,470
Sounds good.

187
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,350
With an idiotic smile that's contagious.

188
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,600
Yes, yes, I'd like that.

189
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,020
When he's in a good mood, he's a natural bitch who easily falls for you.

190
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,680
Oh ho!

191
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,580
<i>This feels so good!</i>

192
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,420
Augh! I can't...!

193
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,470
The more I try to think, the more he resembles the one in the previous issue!

194
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,330
It doesn't matter, does it?

195
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,090
A manga similar to the previous one...

196
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,200
Hyper welcomed!

197
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,410
Is that so?

198
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,910
Of course!

199
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,730
We, fans of Mr. Honeniku,

200
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,390
love all of Mr. Honeniku's manga that are bursting with "love"!

201
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,100
It's overflowing!

202
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,870
So as long as you draw it with all your heart,

203
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,730
that will be enough.

204
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,330
Is that what it is?

205
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,440
That's what it is.

206
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,290
So I'm saying, just draw to your heart's content.

207
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,790
That natural puppy bitch with manly titties gay manga!

208
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,420
I said it! How embarrassing!

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,230
I'm so vulgar!

210
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,370
Unconsciously, that thing in my heart

211
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,710
couldn't help but throb out of control.

212
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,910
That thing in your heart?

213
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,710
What, you don't know?

214
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,990
All female fans of BL...

215
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,110
have a p*nis growing in our hearts.

216
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,220
Hup.

217
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,550
From the bottom of my heart, I hope you will finally get the inspiration to draw.

218
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,290
See you.

219
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,090
Oh...

220
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,080
Yes?

221
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,030
Thanks... for today.

222
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,510
I really didn't do much consulting.

223
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,740
No, not that.

224
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,920
For defending me today.

225
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,130
Oh the slap?

226
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,040
That was just me getting seriously pissed off.

227
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,990
Afterwards, I was like:

228
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,930
"Who do you think he is?

229
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,990
He is <i>THE</i> legendary doujin author,

230
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,460
Mr. Honeniku!"

231
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,280
Or so, I wanted to say, but didn't.

232
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,510
Yeah, cause if you did, I'd be busted,

233
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,480
everyone would search the genre, and...

234
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,000
They'd find out you draw buff gay erotica.

235
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,170
It's not like I wanted you to find out either.

236
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,350
My condolences!

237
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,430
But...

238
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,520
knowing even one person gets me is...

239
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,430
heartening.

240
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,100
Someone's being unusually honest.

241
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,600
- Good boy!
- Shut it...

242
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,130
- Keep it up! 
 - You're loud...

243
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,860
Hey -

<i>[21:30 Radio Show : Shiny Smile's Miracle Smile]</i>

245
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,460
Crap! I almost forgot...

246
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,330
<i>Welcome again to Shiny Smile's Miracle Smile!</i>

247
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,310
<i>We're here again, to deliver wonderful smiles!</i>

248
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,870
Here's our first letter: "I really respect Issei,

249
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,280
- <i>who's always smiling."</i>
- <i>Thanks.</i>

250
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,500
<i>"Issei, who is someone you respect?"</i>

251
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,760
<i>How about it, Issei?</i>

252
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,040
I respect those who are earnest about their passions.

253
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,780
In other words?

254
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,460
Confronting your passions isn't as easy as it seems.

255
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,340
<i>You may come to hate it,</i>

256
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,090
<i>while pursuing it in earnest.</i>

257
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,280
<i>That's really scary to think about, right?</i>

258
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,050
<i>Even so, </i>people who don't run,

259
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,840
and confront their likes,

260
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,840
are both amazing and wonderful.

261
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,060
- <i>Yeah, I love people like that too! They're super cool.</i>

262
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,960
<i>Right?</i> <i>And there you have it folks!</i>

<i>Up next...</i>

265
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,120
Let's draw what I like to draw.

266
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,620
I'll draw... a sequel to my previous work.

267
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,800
Gross.

268
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,730
Look who's drawing men, <i>again</i>.

269
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,580
Now <i>that's</i> a nice expression.

270
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,540
We'll be appearing on the Japanese Music Festival (JMF)?!

271
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,290
W-Wait, isn't that the really long show that runs live?!

272
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,400
Shiny Smile's never been better!

273
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,890
Here!

274
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,390
Don't let it get to your head!

275
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,240
We can't perform something crude.

276
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,560
If we get off-pitch live, you know what happens.

277
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,010
Kou's as harsh as ever.

278
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,530
Did Tsubasa nit-pick you too, Issei?

279
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,780
The JMF... is the same as Mamocchi's big day.

280
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,060
I really wanted to go...

281
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,230
Ah, the childhood friend?

282
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,710
Yeah.

283
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm amazed you still get along with a childhood friend.

284
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,480
You two meet often?

285
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,800
Nope.

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,340
Actually, that was the first I saw him since graduating high school.

287
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,050
Even so, I'd never forgotten him.

288
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,830
Not for a day, or a second.

289
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,770
You're being superfluous.

290
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,570
Not at all!

291
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,420
After all, Mamocchi's the reason

292
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,970
why I'm an idol.

293
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,950
Sure, maybe I don't have the resolution Tsubacchi does.

294
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,980
But, so long as Mamocchi's acknowledges me...

295
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,800
If it's to gain his acknowledgment, I'd...

296
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,910
I'd stand atop all idols, like my life depends on it.

297
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,130
