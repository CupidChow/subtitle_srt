Waddle-waddle, waddle-waddle.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,840
Would you like my help with that poster?

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,200
No. No thank you.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,930
But this is a fun event for all!

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,660
Helping out leads to world peace, you know?

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,940
I said, no thank you.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,710
And I'm sayin' let's get along, you dumbass.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,500
- Ever heard of the phrase "one-for-all"?
- Nope.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,970
- Then pull out your dictionary  and don't you forget it! 
- Wow, they're already arguing.

That's because of the number of performers.

I wouldn't.

25
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,690

Yes, I'm Takkun.

48

Oh, I'd be troubling the other customers - or not.

49

What's inside?

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,620
Wow, I wanted some eye masks!

57
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,260
Are these DIY? I didn't know you could DIY them!

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,540
Wow, I'll give it a go!

59

 - Here you are.

Even volume two of commercial books, sell less than the first.

- I haven't said anything yet.

133
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,100
I didn't even say the first syllable.

Wow, that's rude.

135

- My manga -
- You better come home.

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,880
- Ma -
- Come home.

192
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,740
I'm home.

- Welcome back, Mamocchi! 
 - Welcome back, Mamocchi!

194

I bought all of Shiny Smile's CDs.

- Of course!

196
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,680
Let me see that.

197
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,740
To "Tae", and with a heart.

198
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,420
No fair! Me too!

199
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,780
Stand down, he'll only sign mine.

200
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,770
- Why!? 
 - Because I'm your mom.

201
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,200
- Your mother.
- That's crazy logic!

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,820
- Wait, wait, wait.
- WHY!?

203
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,410
- Do you support her logic - !?
- Not that!

204
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,320
Yes, I don't get her logic, but wait!

205
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,410
- Why are you here?
- Huh? I got Obon off.

206
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,150
But why are you <i>here</i>?

207
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,400
When I told your mom that I'd consider returning if you also came back,

208
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,780
she said she'd drag you home.

209
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,220
So, here I am. Wait, why call someone <i>else's</i> family?

210
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,760
Cause <i>you</i> wouldn't.

211
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,110
I gave you my contact information, didn't I?

212
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,810
<i>Come home for Obon this year.</i>

215
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,420
<i>Everything will crash and burn.</i>

216
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,310
Issei should've stayed for dinner.

217
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,030
Aren't you glad to be back for a homemade meal?

218
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,140
Here, have some seconds.

219
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,610
Yeah, you were after <i>Issei</i>.

220
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,450
Drop that expression.

221
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,590
Anyhow, every mother wants their son eat good food.

222
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,190
I know you're working hard in Tokyo.

223
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,160
But you're always welcome home whenever you want a good meal.

224
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,750
You scarfed down your meal, didn't you?

225
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,060
You even had seconds.

226
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,480
Fork up information about Issei.

227
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,040
Give me us contact info, ID, all of it.

229
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,010
Huh? But your sentimental spiel...

230
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,190
What?

231
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,010
- Give us Issei's information! 
 -  You're playing dirty!

232
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,050
Finally... I can text Issei!

233
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,820
Hell no, I'm not telling you two!

234
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,800

I'm so happy to see Issei making it big.

238
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,930
At long last, smiles come naturally to him.

239
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,780
Huh?

240
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,540
He's always been aloof. Hasn't changed a bit.

241
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,070
So you never knew.

242
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,440
I shouldn't gossip too much about other people's families.

243
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,290
You see, Issei's family... is a little complicated.

244
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,190
is a little complicated.

245
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,490
They were quite famous in the neighborhood.

246
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,740
What the hell are you <i>doing</i>!?

247
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,590
Remember how we use to talk at night like this, in high school?

248
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,940
Yeah, you one-sidedly did.

249
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,740
Even so, you always kept me company.

250
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,840
That made me a happy guy.

251
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,310
Besides, I was at my happiest

252
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,460
when talking with you, Mamocchi.

253
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,710
Mamocchi?

254
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,710
I promised myself...

255
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,700
I'd never meet you again...

256
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,900
<i>I won't... no, can't believe it.</i>

257
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,700
<i>Your smile was...</i>

258
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,870
What's got you all clammed up?

259
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,310
I only just heard...

260
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,870
all about it... from my mom.

261
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,870
About your...

262
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,680
parents... and whatnot.

263
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,570
Did that get you worried about me?

264
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,380
No, not really.

265
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,560
Yup, you're as kind as ever, Mamocchi.

266
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,940
What?

267
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,450
Yeah...

268
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,000
I think... we were different from a "normal" household.

269
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:39,510
Mom always loved someone other than my Dad.

270
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,130
Our house was always

271
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,060
dead silent because of it.

272
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,640
Whenever being in my own home was suffocating,

273
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,100
I'd unconsciously go to your place.

274
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,560
And from within,

275
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,820
I always heard cheerful laughs.

276
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,870
I envied your home's atmosphere.

277
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,780
That's why I decided I'd smile, even if no one else in my family would.

278
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,170
But...

279
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,010
<i>Issei.</i>

280
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,750
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

281
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,600
<i>It's sickening.</i>

282
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,240
I thought my smile

283
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,960
made people uncomfortable.

284
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,650
<i>I... knew nothing about him, yet...</i>

285
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,380
<i>When I'm with you, the more I realize I'm so insignificant!</i>

286
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,520
<i>Someone who's always happily walking in a bright place, saying he looks up to me?</i>

287
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,510
<i>Stop kidding me!</i>

288
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,550
<i>How horrible could I be?</i>

289
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,160
But you know what?

290
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,230
You gave meaning to my smile, Mamocchi.

291
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,170
<i>If you can always smile like that all the time,</i>

292
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,630
<i>why don't you become an idol or something?</i>

293
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,820
Thanks to you,

294
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,710
I came to like my smile I started to hate.

295
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,910
That's why I decided

296
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,670
I'd become a top-tier idol.

297
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,370
<i>Why hadn't I noticed it before?</i>

298
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,740
<i>This guy's smile is so sorrowful...</i>

299
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,760
<i>yet so strong.</i>

300
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,340
Aw, my manager says to return to Tokyo, ASAP.

301
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,800
Bummer.

302
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,740
She interrupted my nice talk with you.

303
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,830
Sorry, I've gotta go.

304
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,030
Mamocchi!

305
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,710
I think I'll continue to visit you often.

306
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,430
After all, my feelings haven't changed one bit.

307
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,560
Let me repeat what I said the day you told me

308
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,310
we'd never meet again.

309
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,100
I...

310
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,840
<i>don't really understand much</i>

311
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,830
<i>about how liking guys isn't "normal".</i>

312

Even so, I like you lots, Mamocchi!

<i>Did they make</i> slight <i>progress?</i>

320
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,600
<i>Maybe the teasing will ease up...</i>

321
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,330
<i>Not!</i>

322
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,690
<i>Hopefully, they'll become happy together...</i>

323
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,280
<i>Anyways, see you all next episode!</i>

324
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,940
I'll no longer be on the wall...

325
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,060
Let's overcome this, together.

326
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,010
This situation is all <i>your</i> fault.

327
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,340
Results are everything in this world.

328
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,630
What did we ever do!?

329
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,930
I <i>KNEW</i> it!

330
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,360
Aren't you... forcing a smile?

331
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,060
Mind if I crumble my facade for a bit?
