Where's your home?

If it's money, I'll pay for it.

159

Huh?

160
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,960
Trying to appeal to someone from another world?

161
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,710
What? No, I'm not.

162
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,610
It's a pain to go home by train.

163
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,140
Shall we go home by taxi, then?

164
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,600
What, really?! That's great!

165
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,100
- Let's quickly go home and play Street Fighter.
- Okay!

At home, we can get good meat at cheap prices and eat large amounts of it.

So, how were the sales figures at Comic Kingdom this time?

184
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,830
My senses tell me that it performed much better than the previous round.

185
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,540
Well... to be honest, sales for the the new book increased by only around 30 copies.

186
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,130
What? Seriously?!

187
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,800
I thought we sold more than that.

188
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,180
But... sales for the old issues were unexpectedly good.

189
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,530
Isn't that proof that there are people who came for the first time?

190
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,320
There are so many people who want my book.

191
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,540
It made me happy

192
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,280

But then, Tsubasa is really manly!

- What?! There's a post saying that Shiny Smile is nearby!
- Huh?

200
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,400
- I didn't know that! Where?!
- Tsubasa's over there!

Over there. My childhood friend is over there!

If Mamocchi hadn't given me a push,

I wouldn't have dreamed of becoming an idol.

- Social media is fine, too!

Wow! Of course!

- Hey, what was that just now?
- Tsubasa...

239
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,420
Can you stop calling out to some random guy in front of our fans?

240
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,810
Stop it. He just wants to talk to his childhood friend.

241
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,670
I don't care whether they know each other!

242
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,830
We're all professionals here.

243
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,610
Well, if my friend was among them, I'd probably call out to him too.

244
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,980
Sorry.

245
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,480
I don't need that!

246
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,040
If you want to behave like a complete amateur, just quit this industry right away!

247
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,140
You're hindering us from becoming top idols.

248
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,130
You hear that? Disappear from our sight right away.

249
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,740
Enough already.

250
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,000
You're right.

Ah, I'm glad to be in the same group as you, Tsubacchi.

254
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,250
Jeez, he's super positive about it.

255
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,950
I'll become better in front of our fans!

256
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,780
I'm reflecting.

257
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,680
I'll work hard to be one of the best!

258
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,390

Gosh, I'm full of respect for Tsubacchi all over again.

260
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,090
Huh?

261
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,510
But he was rather furious, saying things like...

262
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,440
"Disappear from my sight" and all.

263
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,670

264
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,240
Gratitude for one piece of advice (ichigon), huh?

Strawberry...

268
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,670
Have you ever tried adding strawberries to miso soup?

269
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,850
Those lovesick geeks were scary.

270

our worth, or the dimension we're in, everything's different!

326
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,290
Looking at you is good enough... watching you is good enough!

327
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,810
I really can't meet you face to face!

328
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,400
Peep...

329
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,770
<i>Which one is it, Nekoyashiki?</i>

330
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,080
Just a little peep! Ah-nn!

331
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,940
<i>Do you love Issei?</i>

332

<i>Which one is it?!</i>

333

<i>Well then, let's meet again!</i>

336
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,750
As long as Mamocchi can recognize me,

337
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,900
I'll do whatever it takes to be the top idol.

338
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,210
I have to make a decision.

339
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,640
Get dropped from the wall?!

340
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm different from you guys.

341
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,130
I'll rise to the top where I can shine the brightest.

342
