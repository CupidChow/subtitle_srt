3
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,880
The year a plague struck the village,

4
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
my sister was the only physician there.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,560
Lian,

6
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm so uncomfortable.

7
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
He, it's all right.

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
We'll be fine.

9
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,480
Even though she was sick, she went
into the mountains to gather herbs

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,400
to search for a cure.

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
She miraculously recovered

12
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,440
after returning from the mountain.

13
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,320
To save me,

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,480
my sister decided to use
her own blood as a remedy.

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
Surprisingly, my condition improved.

16
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
Everyone said

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
my sister encountered
the mountain spirit in the mountains,

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,840
and her blood could cure diseases.

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
Hence, they began demanding her blood,

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,600
like leeches.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
Thank you.

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
One bowl after another.

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,480
Endlessly.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,640
Blood!

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
My brother is still young.

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,520
Physician Mu.

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,240
I must stop doing this.

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
Please give us a bit more, Physician Mu.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,560
We're begging you, Physician Mu.

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,840
Please, Physician Mu.

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,800
Please help me, Physician Mu.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
I beg of you, Physician Mu.

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Physician Mu.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
My sister had no more
blood left to give.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
But he,

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,360
as the village head,

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,880
led a mob

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,200
to storm into my house

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
and took my sister away.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
Hurry!

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
Take her away!

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
Let's go.

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,560
- Let's go.
- He.

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,880
Go.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,680
He!

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,400
He!

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,040
Lian!

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,840
To justify their actions,

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
they actually accused my sister
of being a cursed thing.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,240
Just how selfish can one be?

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
You drained my sister's blood

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,400
for your benefit.

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,720
You're murderers!

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,760
But Lan...

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
She truly loved you!

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
I didn't love her!

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
I've been hiding my identity for years

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,000
just for this revenge.

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,520
She was nothing
but a tool for my vengeance.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
As for you,

61
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
I'll drain every single drop of blood

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,120
from you.

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,800
An eye

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,240
for an eye.

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
And you too.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
I told you to leave,

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,000
but you didn't.

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,080
You helped these murderers.

69
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,320
Now

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,280
you can't blame me.

71
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,800
Chen He,

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,040
mend your ways.

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,320
I have no way back.

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Protect the villagers!

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,600
All right!

76
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
The sun rises!

77
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,640
Sir.

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,520
Corpse Feng.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Chen He, you...

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Sir,

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
do you think I was wrong?

82
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,720
Don't you think they should be punished?

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,960
If I'm wrong,

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
will my sister blame me?

85
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Chen He,

86
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
you're not wrong.

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
It's the world.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
It's the people.

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
Thank you.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,360
Thank you.

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
Chen He.

92
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,920
I deceived you.

94
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,240
I came to Lianhua Abode for my revenge.

95
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
If only Corpse Feng

96
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,960
could bring you back to life.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Lian,

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm coming for you.

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
Can love

100
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
be a tool for vengeance?

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,920
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Love is love.

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,520
Hate is hate.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,880
The moment he used Chen Lan's love,

105
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,440
there was no love in him.

106
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
Chen, I feel so sorry for them.

107
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
If times could rewind,

108
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,960
would they have lived a happy life?

109
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Fate brings people together

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,680
and separates them when it ends.

111
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,960
But there's no ifs.

112
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,400
Hold on.

113
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,280
Hold out your hands.

114
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,720
Keep it safe.

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,440
I'll get it back.

116
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
Sir,

117
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
did you really search for it?

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,520
That's very important.

119
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,120
Miss,

120
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,200
I almost turned the place

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,480
upside down,

122
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,080
but I couldn't see the Phoenix Gall
you talked about.

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,360
I only found Mu Lian's body

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,880
in the cave.

125
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
It shouldn't be.

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,080
The Phoenix Gall and the Corpse Feng
share a symbiotic relationship.

127
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
How could it not be in Mu Lian's body?

128
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,680
I remember now.

129
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,840
I saw a cripple in the mountains.

130
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,240
He lives somewhere near the mass grave.

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,160
A cripple?

132
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,320
Again?

133
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,400
What's wrong with that?

134
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,520
I'm not sure yet,

135
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,720
but I have a feeling
this person has been around us.

136
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
I suspect

137
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,400
there's a connection
between Chen He's Corpse Feng

138
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
and that person.

139
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,560
What should we do now?

140
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,640
Without the Phoenix Gall,

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,040
your grandfather's condition
can't be cured.

142
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,000
Young chap,

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,160
there's something
I've been meaning to ask.

144
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,480
What has happened to your grandfather?

145
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,200
Why does he need the Phoenix Gall?

146
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,720
The Phoenix Gall belonged
to his grandfather in the first place.

147
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,320
As far as I'm concerned,

148
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
only Zhang Tianzheng

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
ever owned it.

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,760
You knew my grandfather?

151
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,720
How much do you know

152
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,800
about the Jinwu Incident?

153
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Hold on.

154
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
I knew him,

155
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
but we weren't close.

156
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Back then,

157
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,800
he asked me to go somewhere with him.

158
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,400
On that day,

159
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,480
I was too drunk

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,400
to go,

161
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
so I sent my junior brother.

162
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
However, that was the last

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
I saw of him.

164
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,800
Afterward,

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,280
I quit drinking

166
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
and came here

167
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
to look after his mother.

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,760
Where were you planning to go

169
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,800
and what for?

170
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,840
What for?

171
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
I don't know.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
But I heard

173
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
the place was called

174
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,680
Tang Valley.

175
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
Tang Valley?

176
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,720
Sir,

177
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
can you take us there?

178
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
Forget it.

179
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm not young anymore.

180
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,480
Besides,

181
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,280
I have to look after my mother.

182
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,360
In that case,

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,400
let's leave.

184
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,440
Wait.

185
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,680
Maybe

186
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
Ma of the North

187
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,280
could help you.

188
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Ma of the North?
