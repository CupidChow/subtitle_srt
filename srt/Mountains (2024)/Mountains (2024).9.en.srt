00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,260
Lan,

4
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,340
the Zi hour is over.

5
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,820
It's the seventh day since your death.

6
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,940
I'll definitely avenge you.

7
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,100
I'm sorry for your loss.

8
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,380
She wouldn't want to

9
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,220
see you sad.

10
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,220
Is this from her?

11
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm to blame.

12
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,500
I didn't protect her.

13
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,860
Where were you doing?

14
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,980
Oh, please.

15
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,100
Do you really have to
watch me so closely?

16
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,820
What if you run away?

17
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,620
Why?

18
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,460
Are you following me to the bathroom?

19
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,700
I will if you dare.

20
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,420
Impressive, Ms. Duan.

21
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm warning you,

22
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,980
don't try to pull any silly tricks.

23
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,180
Don't forget why we're here.

24
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,220
I know.

25
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,380
We'll leave once I get the Phoenix Gall,

26
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,740
then cure my grandfather

27
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,020
and uncover the truth from back then.

28
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,780
Chief!

29
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,180
Chief! This is bad, chief!

30
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,580
Chief!

31
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,820
Another child went missing, chief!

32
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,220
He's sick.

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,940
What has happened?

34
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Yong...

35
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,180
Yong is missing.

36
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,780
I don't know how he went out.

37
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Right. He's taken by the zombie.

38
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,940
That's right.

39
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,900
Please don't worry.

40
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,260
I'll catch the zombie

41
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,420
and bring Yong back.

42
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,980
You must save him.

43
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,100
You have to save him.

44
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,980
I will.

45
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,540
Please rest assured.

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,860
What is this?

47
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,060
What has happened?

48
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,700
A zombie caught another villager
last night.

49
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,380
It's the boy you met before.

50
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,180
Lun,

51
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,620
take her back to rest.

52
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,100
Hold on.

53
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
I believe this is Yong's thing.

54
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,100
Yong.

55
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,620
Yong.

56
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,220
Yong.

57
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,660
Sir,

58
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,180
you should leave now.

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,340
Don't risk your lives.

60
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,140
Thank you,

61
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,740
but we can't leave yet.

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,060
There's something we still need to do.

63
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,460
But

64
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,140
the zombies...

65
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,460
Thanks.

66
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,140
This is a nice knife,

67
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,660
but you've got to know how to use it.

68
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,420
Is there a Taoist

69
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,540
in the village?

70
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,100
(Yudexiang Store)

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,260
No one knows

72
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,220
when he started living in this village.

73
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,820
He keeps to himself.

74
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,740
Anyway, he's a strange man.

75
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
Is this how Mount Mao

76
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,660
treats its guests?

77
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,460
Young chap,

78
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,060
I'm afraid you came here uninvited.

79
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,860
Let go.

80
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,460
Well, well.

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,620
Times have changed.

82
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,180
You shouldn't use this

83
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,100
against me, should you?

84
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,500
Young chap,

85
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,500
you young people

86
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,460
have the wrong etiquette.

87
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,340
Who's there?

88
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,900
Mother.

89
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,660
Two of my friends came.
Are you all right?

90
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,180
I'll leave you to it, then.

91
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,820
You can go back. Be careful.

92
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,420
Suit yourself.

93
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,300
I'm Yang Jiusi.

94
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,660
What brings you here?

95
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,780
I came here

96
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
to ask you something.

97
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,540
What do you know

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,060
about those zombies?

99
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,580
Zombies

100
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,820
come in purple zombies,

101
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,420
white zombies, and wandering zombies.

102
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,740
That's not what I'm asking.

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
I want to know

104
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,540
if you have anything

105
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,220
to do with the zombies.

106
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,140
I do.

107
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,500
Mount Mao

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,060
and zombies

109
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,020
are enemies.

110
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,020
You see.

111
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,900
You're being impulsive again.

112
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,780
Do you really believe
in the existence of zombies, sir?

113
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,140
If you don't,

114
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,460
why came here?

115
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,260
If that's the case,

116
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,700
what about the zombies

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,340
in this village?

118
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,700
Zombies

119
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,940
are the product

120
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,620
of negative energies in the world.

121
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,220
They turn into zombies after a century

122
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,460
and into a Ba after a millennium.

123
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,220
All of this

124
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,740
started

125
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,020
with the corpse dug out

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,660
in the village.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
The corpse?

128
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,940
Of course.

129
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,460
It's just rumors.

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,260
I went into the mountains last night
to investigate.

131
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,940
However...

132
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,260
Oh no!

133
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,140
It's the solar eclipse!

134
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,100
Run!

135
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,620
The solar eclipse appears.

136
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,140
It turns all villagers into
wandering zombies.

137
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,260
That corpse will turn into a Ba as well.

138
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,540
Yong!

139
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,100
Yong!

140
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,140
Where are you?

141
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,500
Yong!

142
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,940
Yong!

143
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,900
Yong!

144
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,940
Yong.

145
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,740
Yong?

146
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Yong?

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,980
But the corpse

148
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,340
only died over a decade.

149
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,220
Why would it turn into a zombie?

150
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,900
Let me tell you this.

151
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,460
If that person

152
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,540
consumed some precious tonic
before dying,

153
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,980
the body would remain intact

154
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,580
and mutate into a zombie.

155
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,220
Phoenix Gall.

156
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,700
By the way, sir,

157
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,700
the village head called the corpse

158
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,100
a cursed thing.

159
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,340
Mother.

160
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,420
Mother.

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,700
Are you all right?

162
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,940
I'm good.

163
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,500
Though she brought a curse,

164
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,740
she raised her brother all by herself.

165
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,340
She was pitiful.

166
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,540
Why did you tell them that?

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,620
I'll help you upstairs.

168
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,660
Ms. Duan,

169
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,380
do you trust them?

170
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,020
You saw it yourself yesterday.

171
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,180
Well,

172
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,620
looks can be deceiving.

173
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,900
This is bad!

174
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,420
Yong's mother is dead!

175
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,620
Sir,

176
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,860
you should leave this place.

177
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,900
Another death.

178
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,940
That thing killed again.

179
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,420
It must be the cursed thing.

180
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,980
Wait for me.

181
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,500
We should go now. Yong's mom

182
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820
will turn into a zombie soon.

183
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,060
Seems like

184
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,900
it was the zombie again.

185
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,100
Young chap,

186
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,580
do you still

187
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,220
want to meddle in this?

188
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,060
Zhang Beichen,

189
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
don't forget what we're here for.

190
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,180
It seems

191
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,020
someone doesn't want me to meddle.

192
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,500
What a coincidence.

193
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,500
The thing we're after

194
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,980
happens to be related to them.

195
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,420
Sir,

196
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,740
we need your help.

197
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,900
Since you're asking for my help,

198
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,220
I'll reluctantly take you along.

199
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,380
On the day of the solar eclipse,

200
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,860
the Yin energy reaches its peak.

201
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,980
Tonight,

202
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,620
the corpse

203
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,500
will turn into a Ba.

204
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
Sir,

205
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,300
everything is prepared

206
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,580
as you requested.

207
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,820
The villagers have been
escorted to the yard.

208
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,620
Very well.

209
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,700
We should get going,

210
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,660
young chap.

211
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,860
I'm coming with you.

212
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,340
You stay here.

213
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,900
I have a more important task for you.

214
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,060
Zhang Beichen,

215
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,340
who gives you the right to order me?

216
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
Ms. Duan,

217
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,580
look around here.

218
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,020
Is there anyone more skilled than you?

219
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,660
Only you can keep them safe.

220
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,300
You must stay here

221
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,460
to watch over Ling'er and the rest.

222
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,580
You better come back.

223
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,820
I'll say it again.

224
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,540
Don't try to pull silly tricks on me.

225
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,820
Ling'er is still here.

226
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,740
Don't worry.

227
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,180
Let's go.

228
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,620
Sir,

229
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,340
will this work?

230
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,540
Humans have three obstacles,

231
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
and so do zombies.

232
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,420
One, the Life-claiming bell.

233
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,140
Two, the Soul-locking Talisman.

234
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,820
Three, the Sound-scattering Soul.

235
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,220
These three can completely

236
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,580
keep zombies under control.

237
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,420
Young chap,

238
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,260
stop overreacting.

239
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,180
It's not cool.

240
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,060
Chen.

241
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,900
Chen.

242
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,780
Who are you?

243
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,060
Zhang Beichen asked me
to look after you.

244
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,180
No, I need to find him.

245
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,980
Lie still.

246
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,580
He went to capture the zombie.

247
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
You should rest here.

248
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,020
There's no zombie.

249
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,740
No zombie?

250
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,220
What's that, then?

251
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,660
The village head is behind all this.

252
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,700
