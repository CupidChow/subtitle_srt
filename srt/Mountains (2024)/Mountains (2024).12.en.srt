00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,000
The car broke down.

4
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,400
You're Duan Siyan?

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,160
Well,

6
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,200
I'll call you

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,080
Duan.

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,320
We fought side by side yesterday.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,520
Why are you so cold today?

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,440
That's his request.

11
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,400
Don't flatter yourself.

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,320
What did Chen owe you?

13
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are you pulling a long face?

14
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,040
It's not cute at all.

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,440
Duan,

16
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,640
did Chen fail you?

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,880
You know what?

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,200
Guys have many bad intentions.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,440
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

20
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,880
Is the car fixed yet?

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,560
His grandfather owed me this.

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Not even his life can repay it.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,880
Old man?

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Chen.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't be absurd.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,080
Once we reach Mihe Town

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,800
and find the Ma family of the Northeast
Taoist Yang mentioned,

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
we'll find new answers.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
Who are you?

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
How dare you block the Zhu family's way!

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Get out of the way.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
You're rude.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,440
We didn't block the way on purpose.

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,560
Didn't you see our car broke down?

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,480
Besides,

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,920
you didn't make a noise

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,120
while having a funeral procession
in the middle of the night.

38
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,840
Who could even see you?

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
You little brat, I...

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,080
At the Yin hour
before the Beginning of Winter,

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,800
withered woods encounter frosty show,

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,480
a small boat encounters strong winds.

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
Shock is inevitable.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,400
Everything falls through.

45
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
This is a great misfortune!

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,320
You can't use this road.

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,840
What's wrong with you?

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
Who are you trying to scare?

49
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,960
A great misfortune, indeed.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,440
I told you you can't use this road.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
What are you waiting for?

52
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
Get the body back.

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
A bunch of cowards.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,320
You're bold.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Man,

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,800
are you all right?

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,320
Who do you think you are to possess me?

58
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,200
What's that?

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,360
I've never seen that before.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Know your place.

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,240
Mr. Ma,

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
what are you doing here?

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,720
What has happened?

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,760
You're under a calamity curse.

65
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,640
Calamity curse?

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
It's one's last resentment
before one's last breath.

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
If the calamity curse enters the body,

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
there must be an unresolved injustice.

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,000
What unresolved injustice?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
She hung herself.

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,240
Calamity curse?

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,640
That's what we call

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,200
misfortune.

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,120
Folktales are all lies.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
There's no such curse.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
He's just like you,

77
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,960
pulling spooky tricks.

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
I punish the evil for goodness' sake.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
Today's not suitable for burial.

80
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
Here's my advice.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
Take her back

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,880
and hold a ritual to pacify her spirit.

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,280
All right.

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,520
Hurry.

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,440
Take her away.

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,520
Hold on.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
This will keep you safe.

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,160
Ten silver coins.

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes?

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Uh...

92
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,320
Ten silver coins. No bargaining.

93
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,360
That's too much.

94
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,840
It's only a red thread.

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,480
You think it's expensive?

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Forget it.

97
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,200
Take her away.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,320
Let's go.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,720
What's

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,040
that thread?

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
It's way too expensive.

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,560
I can tell this is a scam.

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,120
Let's go.

104
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,180
(Zhu's Residence)

105
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,920
(In house construction, tilers lay tile,
stonemasons build shaft walls, and five shades)

106
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,900
(of paint invite the Nightmare Town Curse.
From Exorcism Ritual in Divination Records)

107
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
Where is he?

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,760
Do you need exorcist services?

109
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Mister,

110
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,920
aren't you afraid people might get hurt

111
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,280
by your spooky tricks?

112
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm only punishing the evil
for goodness' sake.

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,760
Is that the go-to phrase

114
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,320
for people in your line?

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
Ms. Duan,

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm not like him.

117
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,240
No, you're not.

118
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
You're charging fees.

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,080
Looks like we have the same occupation.

120
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,160
Sure.

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,600
Identify yourself.

122
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Amidst the mystic universe,

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
a troop travels west to east.

124
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,600
Ma? Dong?

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
The Ma family from the Northeast.

126
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Maybe

127
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
Ma of the North

128
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,080
could help you.

129
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
Ma of the North?

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,400
Are you Ma Tianhong?

131
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,080
Come.

132
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
What's this?

133
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,520
It smells great.

134
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
Western tea.

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,760
Try it.

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,520
This is very expensive.

137
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,200
Isn't this indigo wood root?

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Mr. Ma,

139
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,400
let's cut right to the chase.

140
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Take us to Tang Valley.

141
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,120
Uh...

142
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,480
Ms. Duan,

143
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,520
that's too straightforward.

144
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
Well,

145
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
how much do you know

146
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,920
about the Jinwu Incident?

147
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,960
Asking for a favor from a deity

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
isn't free of charge.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,480
Take a good rest.

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,580
(Memorial Tablet
of Spirit Closing Deity)

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,160
Master,

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,520
Zhang Tianzheng's grandson
has finally come.

153
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,720
However...

154
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,680
Mr. Ma,

155
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,840
Master Zhu sends for you
for an urgent matter.

156
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Master,

157
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
Mr. Ma is here.

158
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,640
Mr. Ma, please check around

159
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
my house.

160
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,480
Is there something evil in it?

161
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
Why would I encounter a ghost?

162
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,520
You didn't take the body back, did you?

163
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,880
Body?

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
What body?

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Master,

166
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,120
I ran into Mr. Ma on the road.

167
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
He said that the brat
had an unresolved injustice,

168
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
so he told me to bring the body back.

169
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
The thing is,

170
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,720
she hung herself.

171
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,040
That's why I... I...

172
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
Mr. Ma,

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
the body

174
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,320
may bring bad luck.

175
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,360
Where did you bury her?

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
The... The mass grave.

177
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,080
This is bad.

178
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
The resentment
turns into a malicious force.

179
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Where did she die?

180
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,400
The wood...

181
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,160
The woodshed.

182
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,960
Take me there.

183
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
This way, Mr. Ma.

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Please come this way.

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,280
Here it is.

186
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,600
This is mine.

187
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,640
Old geezer, you were at it again.

188
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,080
Hush! We'll talk about it later.

189
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,840
Something is here.

190
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
What is this?

191
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
It's Nightmare Town.

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,840
Nightmare Town?

193
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,800
What's that?

194
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,360
Nightmare Town

195
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,640
is a kind of curse.

196
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
It's said the curse caster
arranges objects

197
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,640
to achieve their purpose.

198
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
At best, one's luck will be affected.

199
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,640
Well, at worst.

200
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,360
What will happen?

201
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,960
At worst,

202
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,640
one's family will be destroyed.

203
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,600
Mr. Ma,

204
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,920
what should I do?

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,720
Well.

206
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
I'll hold a ritual

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,440
to pacify the resentful spirit.

208
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,440
If I can manage that,

209
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,600
the karma could end in a good way.

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

211
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,960
Thank you so much.

212
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,560
500 silver coins.

213
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,440
That's expensive.

214
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,080
Five hundred silver coins
for the entire Zhu family's lives.

215
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,360
Is it expensive?

216
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,640
No, not at all.

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,280
Prepare the money.

218
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,680
I'll be there later.

219
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,560

220
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
