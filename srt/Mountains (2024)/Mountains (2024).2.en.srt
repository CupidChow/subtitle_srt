3
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,040
Here, old man.

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,040
Take this medicinal concoction.

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,040
No.

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,360
It's bitter.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
I should be scolding you
for loitering around.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,960
So be good and take the concoction now.

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,560
Old man.

10
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,560
Well,

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
what were you doing
in the mountain last night?

12
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,480
I was having the roasted chicken.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
Roasted chicken?

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,160
Why were you having it
at the Mountain Spirit Temple?

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,640
Roasted chickens from Guangde Inn

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,520
smell so nice.

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,320
They're delicious.

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,240
Fine,

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,760
I'll get you one on my way home.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,360
Guangde Inn, huh?

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
You're quite a glutton.

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,680
Roasted chickens from Guangde Inn

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
are tasty.

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
They smell good.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,720
What's this?

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
It's the Thirteen Ghost Gate
Needle Technique.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
Heal the living,

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,600
let the dead speak.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
Isn't that
Little Ghost Doctor's unique skill?

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,600
How did you know that?

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
I know a thing or two about it.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
I've had no problem
examining the other two bodies.

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,760
Their necks were broken.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,600
And the scratches on their bodies
were man-made.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,600
As for Cao Hai's body,

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,840
even the the Thirteen Ghost Gate
Needle Technique doesn't work.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,320
We have three days.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,080
The mayor's daughter

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,440
is getting married soon.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,720
We must

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
solve this case.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,960
One month.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
Zhang Beichen.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
I said, we have only three days.

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,720
Now you're asking for one month?

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
I meant one month of salary.

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,280
Another month of salary?

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
Do I look like a money tree to you?

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
You might as well be a robber.

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
Why do you keep asking me for money?

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
Where's the stuff in his hand?

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,800
What's it?

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,280
I haven't seen it.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,640
Who else was here?

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
Well,

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,680
a man named Sun Buyi was here
to claim the body.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Money Rat.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,840
That mafia?

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,360
(I happen to have something
to talk to him about.)

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,480
(I'll go find him.)

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,660
(Jinbao Court)

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,920
Mr. Sun.

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Your business is doing good.

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,200
Stop messing around.

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,440
(Money Rat)
Well, I...

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,560
Ah.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,960
How did it go with the matter
I asked you to look into?

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,000
Any news?

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,440
I'm telling you.

70
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,440
Your grandfather suffers
from some unusual disease.

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
That stuff might not work.

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
Besides,

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,480
it costs a lot

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
to find out about it.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
Whether it works or not,
it's none of your business.

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Let me know once you've found it.

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,160
I will definitely give you the money
once I've gathered it.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,960
Stop boasting already.

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
Let's see when you will get the money.

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,960
You've even pawned
your grandfather's sword here.

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
So cut the crap.

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Where's it?

83
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,640
What do you mean?

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,000
The one in Cao Hai's hand.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,320
What Hai?

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,360
What are you referring to?

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,360
Yes, it's the Blood Spirit Grass.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,880
Well, I was entrusted with it.

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,360
By whom?

90
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,920
It's the rule in our field.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
I can't disclose his identity.

92
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,040
Li Juntao.

93
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,280
Li Juntao?

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Whoever catches this rooster

95
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,640
before the rest

96
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
will receive 100 silver coins from me.

97
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go!

98
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,040
You're pretty strong, huh?

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,960
You should've just fessed up sooner.

100
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,040
If it weren't for your grandfather's sake,
I wouldn't have done so.

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,600
Sir!

102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,280
That beast is out!

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,920
What?

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Not the herbs!

105
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Get her!

106
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
Net. Get the net!

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,960
Catch her!

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,560
Yes, with the net!

109
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,720
The net!

110
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,440
(It's her.)

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,880
Careful, she's one of my treasures.

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,000
Careful!

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,200
You little lass,

114
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,080
I must teach you a lesson today.

115
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,920
Sun.

116
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,840
Since when did you

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,240
involve in human trafficking?

118
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,960
Is she a human?

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,840
Of course she is.

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,520
Can't you see it?

121
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,360
Look at how she acts.

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,560
I thought she was

123
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,760
a celestial being.

124
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
I even got myself a buyer.

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,040
Trust me.

126
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,840
Sun.

127
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,280
Well, let me tell you

128
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,920
about the punishment

129
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
of human trafficking.

130
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
You can't be defaming me.

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
I found her at the foot of the mountain.

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,800
Were you in the mountain?

133
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
No, I found her at the foot of it.

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
Fine.

135
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,000
Just leave it to me.

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,840
Remember.

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,400
Sure.

138
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Stay away from the mountain.

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes.

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,800
Wait a second.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You haven't paid up.

142
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
I gave you three silver coins, no?

143
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,280
No.

144
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,040
That's the money for the news.

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
So, who is it?

146
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,320
It's Li Juntao.

147
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
Him again?

148
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,840
What exactly is it?

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,640
I have no idea either.

150
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,000
We should just go and ask him.

151
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
Wait.

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This lady left the place with you.

153
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,520
Who is she?

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,280
I don't know.

155
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,640
I saw her in the mountain last night.

156
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Oh.

157
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,400
Could she be the culprit?

158
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,720
Is she not sound?

159
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,480
I asked her question.

160
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
All she did was nodding her head.

161
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
I guess

162
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
she can't speak as well.

163
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
Well, that's such a shame.

164
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
She seems beautiful, after all.

165
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,720
I'm hungry.

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,600
You can speak?

167
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,880
Looks like

168
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,240
she's not dull.

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
It's memory loss.

170
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm hungry.

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
Well, what do we do now?

172
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
What do you do when you're hungry?

173
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Of course you eat something.

174
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,600
We should've done
as I suggested last night.

175
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Instead, you insisted
on entering the mountain.

176
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,720
I...

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,760
Well...

178
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,280
Well...

179
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Well, the chief hasn't given me

180
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
the last month's salary.

181
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,500
(Yunxiang Clothing)

182
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
I never promised you any clothes.

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
Welcome.

184
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
Are you looking for clothes?

185
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,840
No.

186
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,880
We'll just look around.

187
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
My lady,

188
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,520
I saved your life.

189
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,320
You can't be doing this to me, right?

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm all penniless.

191
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,080
Wait...

192
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,360
Behave now.

193
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,760
Well, well, well.

194
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,760
Like I said, you can't get rid of her.

195
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,080
Oh, Mr. Guo.

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,880
What brought you here?

197
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,520
(Guo Zixuan, Anyang Rice Trading)

198
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,280
Cheng.

199
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
Your business is booming, huh?

200
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,280
What's this about?

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,360
Well,

202
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,840
(Zheng Xiuzhi, daughter of the mayor)
my wedding with Xiuzhi

203
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,520
is in two days.

204
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,840
So we want you to make her two outfits.

205
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,320
She's the mayor's daughter
so you must put your effort into it.

206
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,200
What are you waiting for?

207
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,040
Get to work now.

208
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,280
This way, please.

209
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,800
Make sure you do a good job.

210
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
After all, that's the only thing
you're good at.

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
There's a reward for you afterwards.

212
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,000
This Mr. Guo is so arrogant.

213
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:26,800
(Clothes in the most vivid colors,)

214
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:27,220
(which do not fade
under scorching sunlight,)

215
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,060
(and remain vibrant
even after prolonged washing.)

216
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,300
(The colors will not diminish,
ensuring your money is well spent.)

217
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,880
If it hadn't been
for your excellent skills,

218
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,520
I wouldn't have visited your store.

219
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,320
Mr. Wang, well...

220
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,280
Why is she wearing that outfit?

221
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,000
Didn't you say it's not for sale?

222
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
Well...

223
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,800
Since she's wearing it,
why can't you let me have it?

224
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,880
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,840
Let's go now.

226
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,760
What is it with you?

227
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,600
Juntao has booked the theater
for the night.

228
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
And we've been invited
to join him for an opera show.

229
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,960
We can't be late.

230
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,000
Indeed.

231
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
He also has a gift for you.

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,280
Fine.

233
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,520
Let's go now.

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,760
Humph!

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,280
What a snob.

236
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,720
What's wrong with you?

237
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
How could you mess with the outfit?

238
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Go get changed now.

239
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
I really can't afford it.

240
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,640
Go now.

241
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,360
Well,

242
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
she looks pretty good in that outfit.

243
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
What do you mean by that?

244
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,960
Are you trying to make things worse?

245
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,960
Have a seat.

246
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,240
Well,

247
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,760
be good and wait for me here.

248
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,480
Don't do anywhere.

249
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,800
And don't touch anything here.

250
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
I'll be back to pick you up.

251
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,280
Will you be back?

252
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,840
I will.

253
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,040
I'll be back after your nap.

254
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,040
Shan.

255
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,280
Get me two pieces of paper.

256
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,820
(File Box)

257
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,840
There you go.

258
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,240
Take a nap.

259
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,480
Let's go.

260
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,720
Come.

261
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Hurry up.

262
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,160
You heard that, right?

263
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,320
Li Juntao has booked the place
for the night.

264
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,800
The theater.

265
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,240
Mr. Li.

266
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,480
I just wanted to ask you this.

267
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,880
What's it?

268
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,040
What's that stuff in Cao Hai's hand?

269
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Cao Hai?

270
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,800
Since it's his belongings,

271
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,960
you should ask him for it.

272
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,320
What does it have to do with me?

273
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
Didn't you tell Money Rat to retrieve it?

274
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
What Money Rat?

275
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm very busy today,

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
and I don't have time to entertain you.

277
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,320
Let's go.

278
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
We even saved his life back then.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
What kind of attitude was that?

280
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,880
Don't panic,
let's just see how things unfold.

281
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,440
Tell my wife

282
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,400
that I have something to attend to later.

283
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
Young Master, are you going to...

284
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,640
Just mind your mouth.

285
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
If you tell her about it,

286
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
I will break your legs.

287
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,440
Got it.

288
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
We're closing, sirs. Please leave.

289
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,760
Where is he?

290
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,480
I have no idea.

291
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,240
Wait...

292
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,040
I forgot to guard the backdoor.

293
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,400
Let's go.

294
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Wait up.

295
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
What was that?
