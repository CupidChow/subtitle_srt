Clad in armor
and wielding a sturdy sword,

6
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,680
it strides swiftly through all lands.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,640
Zhang Beichen,

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,720
how much longer do you need?

9
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Guard the formation.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,300
Protect the banners.

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,640
It's merely a Demon-Subduing Formation.

There's no way it can trap me.

My thirteenth needle

14
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,360
strikes straight into the throat.

15
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,920
Let go, Duan.

16
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I must help Chen.

17
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,540
The thirteenth needle
can stimulate one's potential, right?

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Duan,

19
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,640
the thirteenth needle

20
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,760
may stimulate one's potential,

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
but

22
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,940
it'll make you forget everything.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
I'd like to

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
meet you again.

28
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,720
It would be like

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,880
two strangers catching
a glimpse of each other in the crowd,

30
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,440

between them.

31
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,960
Will you come back?

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
I will.

What does it feel like?

36
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,520
You'll never see the person
you want to see.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,360
That means I can never see you again.

38

39
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,120
