Chen.

5
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,560
Where's the Zhu family?

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,600
They've all gone missing.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,760
This is bad.

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,360
Do you know where the Zhu family is?

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,840
I don't have time to explain.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,200
Just follow me.

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Wan Yang,

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm here for you.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,480
Weiwan!

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,220
Don't come near.

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,360
This isn't real,

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,120
is it?

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
I killed them.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,680
I used her death

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
to lure you in.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680
Why didn't you tell me?

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,560
Didn't we agree that I'd help you?

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,000
Tianhong,

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
this has nothing to do with you.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,680
How can this not concern me?

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,320
Wan Yang is my friend.

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
You... Both of you...

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
Both of you are my best friends.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,960
(Tomb of Wan Yang, My Beloved Husband)
Didn't we promise to avenge Wan Yang together?

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,600
No.

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,800
Tianhong,

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,160
I can't drag you down.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Put your knife down first.

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,680
Where are the rest?

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,920
I've sent them off
to apologize to Wan Yang.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,520
Why did you do that?

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,440
Why?

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
Master,

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,640
tell them why.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,160
Speak now!

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,320
All right. I'll tell them.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
As long as you don't kill me,

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,040
I'll say anything.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,960
I will.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't worry, Master Zhu.

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,240
We won't hire him.

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Wan Yang,

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,800
it's all right.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,320
As long as I'm with you,

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,820
it's fine, no matter
how difficult life is.

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,320
Don't worry.

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,040
I inherited your father's skills.

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,160
I'll surely find a job

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,280
and make you happy.

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,840
How did it go?

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,840
Please rest assured, Master Zhu.

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,680
I've assigned
the haunted house repairs to him alone.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,280
No one will find out about this.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,240
Remember,

59
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,840
no loose ends.

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,760
Understood.

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,040
I was attracted to her,

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,040
so I planned Wan Yang's murder

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,760
and sent someone

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,080
to harass Weiwan.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,400
Finally,

66
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,320
I married her.

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,200
Tell me,

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
did he not deserve to die?

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,780
Mr. Zhu is the one who hurt you.

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
Why did you hurt others, too?

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,600
They all deserved it.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
You never changed.

73
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,440
You even harassed a maid.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
I took in a young bride
for you back then.

75
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
Isn't that enough?

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm warning you,

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,880
if I catch you doing it again,

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,080
I'll expose you

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
for killing Wan Yang.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
All right.

81
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,480
Well.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,400
You're right, Madam.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
I won't do it again.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,940
Please calm down, Madam.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,160
I just asked her a question,

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,140
and she clung to me
as if I was her lifeline

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,580
and confessed everything.

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Second Madam.

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Is it you, Second Madam?

90
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,400
Everything I said is true.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
I had this coming.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,960
It's my fault.

93
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,900
- Second Madam.
- Get up.

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
I shouldn't have played along
with Master to deceive you.

95
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,760
Please help me.

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,820
- Only you can save me now.
- You've suffered a lot.

97
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Come.

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,280
Be careful.

99
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
Have some.

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Weiwan.

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,040
What are you doing here?

102
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,840
Get out.

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,480
I have something to talk to you.
Calm down.

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,280
Your husband is dead.

105
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,400
Live with me.

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,560
I'll make sure you have a comfortable life.
All right?

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,880
Madam...

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
- Madam Zhu.
- You scoundrel!

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,400
Get out of here.

110
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Madam Zhu.

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Dear Weiwan,

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,360
it's very hard

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,760
for a woman

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,720
to live alone.

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
How about

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,360
you join our family as a second wife?

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
I promise

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,760
no one will bully you again.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
Think about it.

120
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,280
Ms. Su.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,680
Ms. Su.

122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Ms. Su,

123
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,520
this is from Master.

124
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,640
Thank you, Master Zhu.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,080
Ms. Su, Master Zhu said

126
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,600
that if you face any difficulties,

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,720
you can always go to him.

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Ms. Su,

129
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,440
take my advice.

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,520
You still have to carry on with your life.

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,760
Master

132
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
is willing to give you
a shoulder to lean on.

133
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,320
The construction chief back then

134
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,520
is now the Butler Zhu.

135
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
They ganged up,

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
drove me to a dead end,

137
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,040
and made me marry the murderer

138
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,760
of Wan Yang.

139
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,240
What about Young Master Zhu?

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,840
He didn't do anything wrong.

141
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
He knew everything,

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
but he kept silent

143
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
all these years.

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,680
You killed them all.

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
How are you any different from them?

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,760
I know.

147
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
I know.

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,440
Apologize.

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,000
All right.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,280
I'll apologize. I'll apologize.

151
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

153
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

155
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,480
It's pointless to apologize now.

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,760
Wan Yang won't come back anymore.

157
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,160
Weiwan!

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,080
Don't come any closer.

159
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,360
No.

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
- No.
- Stay back.

161
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,160
No.

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,160
I'll take you to turn yourself in.

163
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,960
I believe Wan Yang wouldn't
want you to do this.

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
It's too late, Tianhong.

165
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,300
Thank you for being willing
to help me all this time.

166
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,680
Weiwan!

167
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,920
Tianhong,

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,640
don't be upset.

169
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
Wan Yang and I

170
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,680
can finally meet each other.

171
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,040
The past

172
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,960
dies yesterday,

173
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,720
the future

174
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,800

Come.

178
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
Help me build a snowman.

179
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,880

180
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,640
We have plenty of it

You've been eating free food

182
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Can't you build me a snowman?

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
Eating free food, huh?

184
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,000

Weiwan,

195
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
I found a job.

196
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
- Really?
- Yes.

197
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
That's great.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,760
Wan Yang,

199
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,080
everything will be fine.

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
Weiwan.

201
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
Why couldn't I save her?

202
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
Humans are still humans.

No matter how great your skills are,

you can never discern everything,

205
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
especially not the human mind.

206
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,520
She killed herself long ago,

207
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,680
how could you possibly save her?

208
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,040
Why didn't you tell her

209
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
that you like her?

210
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,520
Do I have to tell her

211
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960
even if I like her?

If she knew there was another person
in this world who loved her,

214
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,960
perhaps she'd have loved the world
a little more.

215

A friend's love

216
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,040
is love, too.

217
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,480
If I were you,

218
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,800
I'd let her now.
