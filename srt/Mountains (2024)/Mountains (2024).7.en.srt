3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,880
Old man,

4
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
time to take your medicine.

5
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,320
Fun! This is fun!

6
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,920
Little Tag-along,

7
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,800
what are you doing?

8
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I saved your life before.

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
My name is Duan Siyan,

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,960
not Little Tag-along.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,800
You remember everything now.

12
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,580
(Mountain Spirit Temple)

13
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,620
(Mountain Spirit Temple)

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
I see.

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
No wonder that tailor
had the ghostly threadworms.

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
What does it have to do
with this old man?

17
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,720
Because

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
I'm here to kill him in the first place.

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,200
Are you insane?

20
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,480
Why do you want to kill a mad old man?

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
It seems you don't know
your grandfather well enough.

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,720
What are you getting at?

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,840
Grandfather,

24
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
why are you holding the soup?

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,440
Drink this.

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,880
Who's there?

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
Stop chasing.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,640
Do you know that person?

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,880
It's none of your business.

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
But this old man is.

31
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,440
Speak up.

32
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,560
What is going on?

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Your grandfather is responsible

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,480
for the destruction
of Four Strange Gates

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
and the Jinwu Rebellion.

36
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
He's also the reason I became an orphan.

37
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,920
Grandfather, get up.

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,840
He's not the kind of man you said.

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,160
That's only your side of the story.

40
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
There must be more to it.

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
It's not up to you

42
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,240
to decide what kind of person
Zhang Tianzheng is.

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,840
You said you became an orphan
because of him,

44
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
so you want to take revenge.

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Fine.

46
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,760
Let me ask you this.

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,560
What have you done?

48
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
Why were you attacked just now?

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,640
No one knows the truth
behind the Jinwu Rebellion,

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,760
and you have no evidence to prove
the old man did it.

51
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,960
What do you want, then?

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm going to find the Phoenix Gall

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,080
to cure the old man's madness.

54
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,080
You can confront him later.

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Why should I trust you?

56
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,920
This is something very important to me.

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,200
You'll keep it for me first.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Not to mention

59
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
I saved your life before.

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,360
Trusting someone

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
cab be easy.

62
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,520
All right,

63
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
but I'm coming with you.

64
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,640
Beichen.

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,120
Um...

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,280
Well.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,680
Sun from Black Street
is looking for you.

68
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,440
He said it's something
about your grandfather.

69
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,880
Mr. Sun.

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,480
No refunds here.

71
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
What refund?

72
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Didn't you call me over?

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Oh, it's you.

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,400
Why?

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Any luck

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,160
with the Phoenix Gall?

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,320
I told you

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,760
the Phoenix Gall

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
is a rare treasure.

80
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
The price of this news

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,240
will be high.

82
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
I could see that coming.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
Go on. Name your price.

84
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,080
It should be at least this figure.

85
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,000
Three silver coins?

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
Thirty.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,080
Thirty silver coins?

88
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,960
I don't have all day.

89
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,000
Tell us now.

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,880
Easy.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
Don't be impulsive.

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,840
This rifle is pricey.

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,960
Mr. Sun,

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,160
do you value money more than your life?

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,600
Now that your life is at stake,

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,760
just tell me.

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,120
She's very dangerous.

98
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,880
Shut up.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,960
If you don't want your head
to get blown off,

100
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,040
spill it.

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,640
Wait.

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,080
Calm down.

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,360
All right. I'll tell you.

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,680
Ten years ago,

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
the Phoenix Gall

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
was last seen

107
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
at Mount Lianhua.

108
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Mount Lianhua?

109
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
Ten years ago?

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Is this source reliable?

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
Absolutely.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,920
However,

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
whether or not it's still there

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,640
depends on your luck.

115
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,040
No wonder Ling'er went to Lianhua Pond.

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
She knows the whereabouts
of the Phoenix Gall.

117
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
Be... Be careful.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
Mr. Sun,

119
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,840
I want to buy my knife back.

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Buy your knife back?

121
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Do you even have money?

122
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,880
Hey, you.

123
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,120
Don't put it down.

124
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
That's your business,

125
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
not mine.

126
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,640
Careful with my rifle.

127
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
How much?

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,480
Ten silver coins.

129
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
Luckily, the case is resolved,

130
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
and I have some rewards.

131
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
I gave you an extra one silver coin.

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,640
One minute.

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,400
One minute.

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
Give me a minute.

135
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,600
Careful with my rifle.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Hurry!

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
I found it.

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,600
Here you go.

139
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,080
This is the one, right?

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
The old staff is always
the most reliable.

141
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,400
This notebook

142
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
belongs to Mr. Zhang.

143
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,920
It's no use keeping it here.

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
Take it away.

145
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,420
(Twelve Mountain-Turning
Talisman Technique)

146
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,200
It's Grandfather's Twelve
Mountain-Turning Talisman Technique.

147
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,760
I thought it had gone missing.

148
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,720
So it's been here all along.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,360
Thanks.

150
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,080
You're welcome.

151
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Can we leave now?

152
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,240
Yes, let's go.

153
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Wait.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,760
You haven't paid for the rifle.

155
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
Pay up.

156
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,560
Pay up, man.

157
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,880
Hurry up.

158
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
How much?

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,320
Give me all of them.

160
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,520
Are you a robber?

161
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,280
This money isn't enough.

162
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,080
Are you serious?

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
Still not enough.

164
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
Take care. See yourself out.

165
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,200
Please come again.

166
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Shan,

167
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
while I'm away,

168
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll leave my grandfather to you.

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,160
Don't worry.

170
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,880
My reward is gone.

171
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
I paid for your clothes

172
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,640
and riffle.

173
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Besides,

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
the journey is long.

175
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,960
Are we really going to walk there?

176
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,120
Are you a mountain roamer, too?

177
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Miss.

178
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Finally, we've found you.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,720
The family leader
sent us to bring you home.

180
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,520
Tell him

181
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
after I'm done with what I want to do,

182
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,520
I'll come home.

183
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,680
But the family head
is worried about you...

184
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
I'll be careful.

185
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
All right, then.

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
Hold on.

187
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you have money?

188
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,320
Huh?

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Money.

190
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,840
Oh, all right.

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,440
Leave the car as well.

192
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Huh?

193
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,800
Understood.
