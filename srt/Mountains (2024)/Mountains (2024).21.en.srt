00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,760
We've been walking all day.

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
Why aren't we there yet?

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,560
Mr. Luo,

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,160
can you tell us about Tang Valley

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,320
and Fusang wood?

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
Tang Valley is

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,480
where the sun rises.

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,920
It's opposite to Yuyuan,

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,400
where the sun sets.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,720
Legend has it

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
that the sun rises
from Fusang Tree every day.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
The Fusang Tree

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,600
connects the immortal realm,

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,600
the mortal realm, and the underworld.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,280
It's the purest Yang existence
in this world.

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,040
That's amazing.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,440
However, obtaining Fusang wood

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,600
could cost you

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
dear.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,800
What cost?

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,080
You'll find out when we get there.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,240
So beautiful.

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,320
Don't touch it!

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,560
Retreat!

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,800
Quickly!

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,000
Go.

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Give me the money.

30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,640
- Why are you asking for money now?
- Hurry.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,380
This actually works.

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,880
You're welcome. Let's go.

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,960
My money.

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,960
My money.

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
Tough luck.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
Money is just a worldly possession.

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
Do you know what the greatest misery is?

38
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,520
Not being able to spend all your money
before you die.

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
It wasn't your money that was wasted.

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,080
Ouch!

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,640
That hurts.

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,440
Hold on.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Where's Luo Sanyou?

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,940
I haven't seen him since earlier.

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,840
Just now...

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
Did he die?

47
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,120
Forget it.

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
There's not much we can do now.

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
We're almost there.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
Let's go.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
This is strange.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,640
Why is there a village
deep in the mountains?

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,520
I heard that
during the Former Qin Dynasty,

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,920
a line of Mozi's descendants

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
couldn't bear the emperor's brutal rule,

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,320
so they chose to live here

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
and never left ever since.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
This sounds

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
very similar to
the Peach Blossom Spring.

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
I beg to differ.

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,440
Chen,

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,640
could there be

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,040
ghosts here?

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,280
There's no such thing.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
But you always attract them

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,360
wherever you go.

67
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,680
Don't worry.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,400
With me around,

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
no spirits or demons
will get close to you.

70
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
Chen.

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,240
Chen.

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,998
(The tallest existence can only be
the branchless Fusang.)

73
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,251
(It towers to the heavens, plunges into
the underworld, and bridges the heaven,)

74
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,298
(the mortal world, and the underworld.)

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,560
(From Xuanji Record of Imperial Reader)

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Chen.

77
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,760
Chen.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
Wake up.

79
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,040
Chen.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,160
I'll do it.

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
What are you trying to do?

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,240
I want to pull you up.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,720
- Why is he awake now?
- Chen.

84
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,760
Why did you pass out?

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,280
I don't know.

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
What is this place?

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,200
This is a temple in the village.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,440
It enshrines

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,400
the Sun Divine, Donghuang Taiyi.

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
This drawing

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,880
seems to depict

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
the legend of the Golden Crow
and the Fusang wood.

93
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,160
If so,

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,600
where's the Fusang wood?

95
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
Everything

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
was created by Taiyi.

97
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,600
Since the Sun Divine, Donghuang Taiyi,
is enshrined here,

98
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
the entrance

99
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,200
must be somewhere nearby.

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,360
It's written up there.

101
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,720
To witness the true divine,
pay respect to the mountain gate.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,180
What is that noise?

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,800
Grandfather.

104
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,160
Grandfather.

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,200
Chen,

106
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
wake up.

107
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,200
I'll do it.

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,900
What are you trying to do?

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,040
I want to pull you up.

110
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,920
Chen, why did you pass out?

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
It's nothing.

112
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,200
(Was that a dream?)

113
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,760
What is this place?

114
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
This is a temple in the village.

115
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,680
It shrines

116
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
the Sun Divine, Donghuang Taiyi.

117
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,400
This drawing

118
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,040
seems to depict the legend

119
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,560
of the Golden Crow and the Fusang wood.

120
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,840
If so,

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,440
where's the Fusang wood?

122
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
Fusang wood.

123
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,040
Everything

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
was created by Taiyi.

125
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,120
Since the Sun Divine, Donghuang Taiyi,
is enshrined here,

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,640
the entrance

127
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
must be somewhere nearby.

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,080
It's written up there.

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,040
To witness the true divine,
pay respect to the mountain gate.

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
To witness the true divine,

131
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
pay respect to the mountain gate.

132
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,720
What's that noise?

133
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
Grandfather!

134
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,440
Grandfather.

135
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,720
Ms. Duan.

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
Are you trying to pull me up?

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,520
I went through this.

138
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,080
What do you mean?

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
