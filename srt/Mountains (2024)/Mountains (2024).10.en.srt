3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,480
No, I need to find Chen.

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,280
Lie still.

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,040
He went to catch the zombie.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,440
You should rest.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,360
There's no zombie.

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,200
No zombie?

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,120
Hold your breath.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,960
Hold your breath.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,360
Sir,

12
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,720
this isn't working.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,800
Come with me.

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
That's impressive, sir.

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,000
Young chap,

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,800
that's professionalism.

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,720
Watch out!

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,320
Sir,

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
run!

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,240
Where's the Ba?

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,760
Where's Chen He?

22
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,000
Looks like he went into the mountains.

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's go.

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,040
Wait.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Why is it moving so fast?

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
Why does it keep pointing
to Lianhua Abode?

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,320
How about this?

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,360
Let's check the place
where the corpse was dug up.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,400
How much longer should we stay?

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
Is it safe?

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Will the zombie appear tonight?

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't know.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,760
You should ask the village head.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Will the zombie come back tonight?

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,640
Please don't worry, folks.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
Zombies won't come tonight.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,240
Really?

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,760
That's great.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Don't worry, everyone.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,800
Miss,

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,720
what is this?

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,800
Chief,

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
what are you doing?

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,440
You're behind all this, aren't you?

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,880
Seems like the young lady is awake.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,920
There are no such zombies.

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,120
It's him.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,760
He poisoned the villagers.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
Do you really think that's poison?

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
What do you mean?

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
Did the villagers find the corpse here?

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
That's what I heard.

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
But this is a good burial place.

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,560
(Tomb of Mu Lian)
What's with all this stuff here?

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
Tomb of Mu Lian.

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,520
What is this?

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
I'll definitely avenge you.

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,880
Run.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,520
Run now!

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Xiaoming Grass?

61
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,920
It's an illuminant herb.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
Is this from her?

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,480
I didn't protect her.

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,440
There's a strange blood smell here.

65
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,520
Drat.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,600
We're being used.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,320
What do you mean?

68
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,280
Lianhua Abode is in danger.

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
Just spell it out.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,920
I don't have time to explain now.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,040
Sir, please do me a favor.

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,760
Go to the cave.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,560
Kind lady,

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,680
are you all right?

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm good.

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,200
Be careful.

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
As for what I promised you,

78
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,480
I made it.

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Leave the rest to me.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,880
I beg of you.

81
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,400
Please don't hurt her.

82
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Please spare her.

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Chief, why are you helping

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
the cursed thing?

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,000
Chief, get her right now.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,560
No.

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
No!

88
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,200
Ling'er,

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
use the needle to suppress her toxin.

90
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,120
All right.

91
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
In fact,

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
she's not a cursed thing.

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
She's his daughter,

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
Chen Lan.

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,080
- She's Chen Lan?
- She's Chen Lan?

96
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
What? Lan?

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,320
Isn't Lan dead?

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,880
She does look like her.

99
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
Young chap,

100
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
you were right.

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
Isn't that Yong?

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
There's a secret passage behind.

103
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,040
Yong is still alive.

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,280
It leads straight into the mountains.

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
That's right.

106
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,800
When I lured the zombie away,

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,760
I accidentally stumbled across
the secret passage.

108
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,720
I returned here through it,

109
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,440
but then

110
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,440
the village head knocked me out.

111
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
How did you find out?

112
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
I should thank you.

113
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,560
Thanks to your nose,

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,200
you caught the stench

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,120
inside the cave and Lianhua Pond.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
There were also footprints
going inward the cave.

117
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
I should've killed you

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
back then.

119
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,480
To resurrect your daughter,

120
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
how many more do you plan to kill?

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,080
Ling'er,

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,160
it's not the village head.

123
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
But I saw it.

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,120
If I'm not wrong,

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,320
someone told you this method

126
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,120
to resurrect your daughter.

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,840
That person fooled you.

128
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
Ba doesn't exist at all.

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,040
No Ba?

130
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
All he wants is to lure you

131
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,880
into refining your daughter
into a monster

132
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,400
and becoming his pawn.

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,800
He wants to kill everyone
in the village.

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,360
Why?

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Besides,

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
no one

137
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,480
has ever seen
an undecayed female corpse.

138
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,080
It's a lie the village head made up

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,800
to cover the truth

140
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
that his daughter has become a monster.

141
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
This is impossible!

142
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
It's possible.

143
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
Did the person tell you

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
the Corpus Feng

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,160
is fed on human blood?

146
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
But my daughter started breathing

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
after eating that.

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
That's the Corpse Feng's breathing.

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,840
It's an extremely poisonous earth herb.

150
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
After consuming it,

151
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
it turns humans into a walking dead.

152
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,960
Chen is right.

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,480
Corpse Feng isn't a plant

154
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,200
or an animal

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
but a rare fungus.

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
It decays under sunlight exposure

157
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,360
and moves when it senses sounds.

158
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
Chen Lan turned into a Ba

159
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,120
because of this.

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,880
Besides,

161
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,880
this toxin

162
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,960
spreads through bites.

163
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,400
Bites?

164
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
That means

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,800
she was bitten.

166
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,320
- Bites?
- Well...

167
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,160
Chen He,

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,560
show yourself.

169
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Sir.

170
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,240
When did you figure it out?

171
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
I didn't suspect you

172
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,680
at first.

173
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,640
It wasn't until I found this

174
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,960
that everything started
falling into place.

175
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,920
Maybe

176
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
I should call you Mu He.

177
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,400
(Tomb of Mu Lian)

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Though she brought a curse,

179
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,040
she raised her brother all by herself.

180
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,480
She was pitiful.

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,800
So he's that Mu He.

182
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,200
Isn't that the cursed thing's brother?

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,280
He's the cursed thing's brother.

184
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
You're Mu He?

185
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,280
You've been fooling me.

186
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,840
Sir,

187
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
I knew you were no ordinary people.

188
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,760
I didn't want to
make things complicated.

189
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,880
I just planned to scare off outsiders.

190
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Run!

191
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,840
Now!

192
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,600
Run now!

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,560
There's a zombie.

194
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,600
But the zombie didn't scare you off,

195
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
and now it's gone this far.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I accept it.

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
But I want to know

198
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,160
what gave me away.

199
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
It's your humanity.

200
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,320
You still have a shred of it.

201
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,280
You've been hesitating.

202
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,840
You didn't kill Ling'er.

203
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
However, you didn't expect

204
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,720
Ling'er to leave Xiaoming Grass
as a mark,

205
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,280
or that we would come here,

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,840
or even that Yong
would stumble into the temple.

207
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
To prevent more accidents,

208
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Yong!

209
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,320
you killed his mother,

210
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
trying to scare us off.

211
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Sir,

212
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,640
you should leave this place.

213
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,880
Another death.

214
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
Looks like someone
doesn't want me to meddle.

215
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,320
What a coincidence.

216
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
The thing we're after

217
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,640
happens to be related to them.

218
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,040
But we didn't leave.

219
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
You've been pretending

220
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,600
to avenge your wife.

221
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,040
You took advantage of Corpse Feng,

222
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,200
which moves according to sound,

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,160
to control the Ba

224
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
and drag you away.

225
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,080
But the Ba

226
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,080
wouldn't hurt you.

227
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,440
Like today,

228
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
you led us somewhere else

229
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,520
so the village head could carry out

230
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,600
a massacre in the village for you.

231
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,040
Chief,

232
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
how could you do this to us?

233
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,000
We trusted you so much,
but you want to harm us.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,720
No wonder

235
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,280
I've been hearing
strange ringing sounds.

236
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,800
As for why Ling'er makes you hesitate,

237
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,000
maybe

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
when you look at her,

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,520
she reminds you

240
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,320
of your sister,
who was also a physician.

241
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,360
