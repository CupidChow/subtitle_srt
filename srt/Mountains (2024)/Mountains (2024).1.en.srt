(Fanhua Theater)

5
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,260
(Zhang Beichen, mountain roamer)

6
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,760
What is it with you?

7
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,480
Hey, Zhang Beichen.

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
Can you take this seriously?

9
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,040
I even gave you an extra month's salary.

10
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,740
(Zheng Shiwu, mayor of Anyang Town)

11
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,560
(Bai Yushan, Anyang Police Station)

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,040
Why?

13
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,440
Is it over?

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,200
What's wrong with you?

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
How could you fall asleep
in this occasion?

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,400
There's nothing to be nervous about.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
It's the same thing every year.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,120
An opera show
before the mountain opening ceremony.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,360
Nothing will go wrong.

20
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,880
Hai.

21
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,080
Is this mountain roamer reliable?

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,840
Everyone says he's not sound.

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,920
Mountains and rivers of the land
stretch from west to east.

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Look, he's babbling again.

25
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,280
Sand emerges and goes through the gorge.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,200
Shush. Just follow him.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
It determine fortune or misfortune.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,720
The twenty-four mountains are divided
into forward and reverse directions,

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,560
searching for the traces of fortune,
misfortune, yin, and yang.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
Search for their traces.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,880
Hai.

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,040
Why did this old man lead us

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,800
to this shabby place?

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,560
Exactly.

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,800
It's creepy.

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
Mountain Ghost Temple?

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Why don't we head back?

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Indeed, Hai.

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,200
Hey, Zhang.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,640
Treasure basin. Roasted chicken.

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Treasure basin. Roasted chicken.
Give me the chicken.

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
(Cao Hai, ruffian)
This is a run-down temple, Zhang.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
Without the Blood Spirit Grass,

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,480
how are you getting yourself
a roasted chicken?

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,400
(Zhang Tianzheng, mountain roamer)
No roasted chicken?

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,440
Well, I'm heading back for my grandson.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
How dare you make a fool out of me?

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
How dare you hit me?

49
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,400
Hai.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
What's that?

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,160
It's the Blood Spirit Grass!

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Blood Spirit Grass. Roasted chicken.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
As expected from a mountain roamer.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,040
Blood Spirit Grass.

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
Despite his dullness,
he managed to located this treasure.

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,160
Roasted chicken.
I want my roasted chicken.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,160
Here's a roasted chicken from Guangde Inn.
Eat up.

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,440
- Get to work.
- Yes.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,240
Keep going!

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,760
(Well, Mr. Bai,)

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,720
(I heard)

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,440
(that Zhang who was in charge
of the ceremony has fallen sick.)

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,120
(A mountain opening ceremony is
a sign of respect to mountain spirits.)

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
(We can't do without him.)

65
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
(Rest assured, sir.)

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,760
(We have his grandson,
Zhang Beichen here.)

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,880
(He's even better than his grandfather.)

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
(That's great.)

69
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,520
(I'm getting old, and I'm not joining it.)

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,160
(You must be cautious.)

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,650
(Legend has it that there are
numerous heavenly and earthly treasures)

72
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,270
(within the desert depths
of the mountains.)

73
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,290
(Mountain dwellers
who gather herbs and hunt)

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,000
(visit the mountains
to get their hands on these treasures.)

75
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,690
(They follow the laws of nature
and the principles of all things,)

76
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,070
(possessing knowledge
of strange and mysterious phenomena.)

77
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,370
(They are collectively)

78
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,400
(known as mountain roamers.)

79
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,650
(The commoners believe)

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,370
(these mountain roamers move freely
around the deep mountains)

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,370
(under the protection
of mountain deities.)

82
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,020
(Thus, they follow these mountain roamers
into the mountain to work.)

83
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,080
(And that is the origin
of mountain roamers.)

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,240
Open your eyes to see the world around.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
Walk through the dark night
with brightness abound.

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,680
Let your ears hear from all directions.

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,280
Find bridges and ask for directions,
with a calm demeanor.

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
Hai!

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,640
What is this, Hai?

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
There must be treasures here. Dig it now.

91
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,840
Go ahead!

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,520
Tonight isn't the night
to enter the mountain gate.

93
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,920
You just can't stop babbling.

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,440
(Li Juntao, Li's Bank)
What nonsense is this?

95
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
Do we even need to burn incenses

96
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
to determine the right time
to enter the mountain?

97
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,800
What a joke!

98
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,960
Whoever catches this rooster

99
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,180
before the rest

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,500
will receive 100 silver coins from me.

101
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,540
Let's go!

102
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,520
Follow me into the mountain.

103
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Let's go.

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,480
Come.

105
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,080
What are you waiting for?

106
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,720
Let's move now.

107
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,560
Hold on.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
In the mountains,
all plants are gifts from the heavens.

109
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
A spirit lies within all living beings.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
I enter the mountain today with reverence.

111
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,680
And one day, I shall chase the moon
and catch the shooting stars.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Let's go.

113
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,940
(When the Azure Dragon falls,
the Mountain Spirit is born.)

114
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
"When the Azure Dragon falls,
the Mountain Spirit is born?"

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,000
What's that?

116
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,860
(When the Azure Dragon falls,
the Mountain Spirit is born.)

117
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,520
Open the case.

118
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,520
What's it?

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,760
Search for treasures over there.

120
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,840
I have something to attend to.

121
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,360
The mayor has gone home.

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,120
Well, why is Mr. Li being a busybody here?

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,040
Be serious.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,960
This mountain opening ceremony is
sponsored by his father, Sir Li.

126
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,320
The extinguished incense indicates that
the mountain is heavy with miasma.

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,240
Got it?

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
Hurry up, Zhang Beichen.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,520
Who would take responsibility
if something happened to Mr. Li?

130
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
I told them so.

131
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,960
It's not suitable to enter the mountain
when there's an extinguished incense.

132
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,160
But they insist on acting otherwise.

133
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
It's got nothing to do with me.

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
This is strange.

135
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Well...

136
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Don't scare me.

137
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
I don't see anything peculiar here.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Let's go.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,520
They are ghosts!

140
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Hold your breath and close your eyes.

141
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,080
Mountains and rivers of the land
stretch from west to east.

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
Sand emerges and goes through the gorge.
It determine fortune or misfortune.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,840
The twenty-four mountains are divided
into forward and reverse directions,

144
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,360
searching for the traces of fortune,
misfortune, yin, and yang.

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,160
From a thousand mountains,
plants gather vital energy.

146
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
Across ten thousand li, heaven and earth
merge into the great yin.

147
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:11,800
Break!

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,440
You can't fool me

149
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
with such a trivial trick.

150
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
Show yourself.

151
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Mr. Li.

152
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,840
Zhang Beichen.

153
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,840
I can see it.

154
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,080
What's the matter with him?

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,600
Is he still alive?

156
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,560
It's mild poisoning.

157
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,240
It won't kill him.

158
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,640
That gave me a fright.

159
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,320
What is going on here?

160
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,120
You really got it right.

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,000
The wind rises, the incense breaks.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,040
When a mountain storm is approaching,

163
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,000
all falls silent.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,680
Numerous illusions then emerge.

165
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,000
All this is merely

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
a gimmick.

167
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,720
You really know
how to determine an outcome with incenses.

168
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,440
We mountain roamers
study and explore the world.

169
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,600
To us, heaven and earth are one.

170
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
There are the laws of nature

171
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,760
as well as the principles of all things.

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,680
If you're able to grasp
the connection between them all,

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,680
you can do it too.

174
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,760
How do you explain the sedan chair?

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
I have no idea either.

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
However,

177
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,040
things aren't peaceful here
in the mountain today.

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,040
Sir!

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,240
Who's that?

180
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,880
It's me.

181
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
This is bad.

182
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
Go slowly. What's happened?

183
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,240
It's the Mountain Spirit Temple.

184
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,580
(Mountain Spirit Temple)

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,040
- Sir.
- Sir.

186
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,160
What do we have here?

187
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,000
It's said that someone messed with
the feng shui of this range.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
They say

189
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
the mountain spirit has been released.

190
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,280
Grandfather?

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,480
Grandfather.

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
What are you doing here?

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Don't kill me!

194
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,560
Grandfather.

195
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,400
I'm Beichen.

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,080
Beichen.

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,840
Could it be this old man

198
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,960
who messed with the mountain spirit?

199
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,920
Check this out, sir.

200
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,440
"When the Azure Dragon falls,

201
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
the Mountain Spirit is born."

202
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,040
What does that mean?

203
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Conduct a search inside, Hu.

204
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,520
Yes.

205
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,920
Come, Grandfather.

206
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm taking you home.

207
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,280
Shush.

208
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
This place is haunted.

209
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,280
It's broad daylight.

210
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,480
There's no ghost here.

211
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,560
(Mountain Spirit Temple)
It's a ghost!

212
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:34,920
Let's go.

213
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
Wait for me, Grandpa.

214
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,960
Hair?

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,840
Put the body down first.

216
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
Cao Hai?

217
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,840
Do you know him?

218
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,600
He was taken to the station all the time.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,280
Sir.

220
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,280
Did he mess with the mountain spirit?

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,320
That's why...

222
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,720
Shut up.

223
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
We're police.

224
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,440
Stop talking nonsense.

225
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
He was a ruffian.

226
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
Perhaps he was killed by his nemesis.

227
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,440
Well...

228
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,880
We all know

229
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,920
that your grandfather

230
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,040
is skilled at mountain roaming
and gathering herbs.

231
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
He even possesses knowledge
of feng shui and Xuanxue.

232
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,760
No ordinary beings could manage to kill

233
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,160
in such a bizarre manner.

234
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Shan.

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,440
What do you mean by that?

236
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,520
Well,

237
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,680
of course I believe your grandfather.

238
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Yet

239
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,160
considering the situation we face here,

240
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,520
how can I explain it to everyone?

241
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,680
Let's seal the mountain first.

242
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,280
No way.

243
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,200
Now it's the time to open the mountain.

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,640
How can I explain it to our people?

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,760
And how do I explain it to the mayor?

246
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
If you didn't seal the mountain

247
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,960
and something happened again,

248
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm afraid you wouldn't
be able to explain yourself.

249
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,920
Fine, we'll seal the mountain, then.

250
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,160
We will do as you say.

251
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,040
However,

252
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,280
you will be in charge of this case too.

253
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,480
You need to pay me extra money, then.

254
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,160
Beichen.

255
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,200
As per the rules,

256
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I need to take your grandfather
to the station.

257
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,560
Forget it.

258
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,640
I won't take the money.

259
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm taking my grandfather home.

260
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,600
Deal.

261
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,660
(Mountain Spirit Temple)

262
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,080
Don't forget to perform an autopsy.

263
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,920
You're also the forensic doctor
of our station.

264
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Take the body back to the station.

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,280
Yes.

266
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,200
("Picking the lingzhi in the mountains,)

267
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:56,580

vines trailing endlessly.)

00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,271
(I resent the young lord
who claims to miss me,)

269
