Mayor.

4
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,320
Bai Yushan,

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
you promised two days, didn't you?

6
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,800
How come

7
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,720
you let the murderer run off?

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,600
What's wrong with you?

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,480
Mayor,

10
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
I know you're anxious,

11
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,720
but please calm down.

12
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,080
The two-day deadline isn't up yet.

13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,640
If anything happens to my son-in-law,

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,640
you'll be the first one I come after.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,160
Father,

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
it must've been her
who had taken Zixuan away.

17
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
Little Tag-along isn't the murderer.

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
It's someone else.

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,880
You're playing favoritism.

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Ms. Zheng,

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
please don't worry.

22
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,000
We'll find the murderer.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,680
She's already gone missing.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,240
Where are you going to find her?

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,320
A bunch of useless fools.

26
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,540
(Memorial Tablet
of My Dearest Friend, Yue Xiang)

27
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,770
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)

28
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,760
Roasted chicken.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,080
It's for you.

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,360
Why did you go into the mountains?

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,160
To eat roasted chicken.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,600
You were eating a roasted chicken
in the Mountain Spirit Temple?

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
I found it at the foot of the mountain.

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,480
You went into the mountain?

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,200
No. I found it
at the foot of the mountain.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Something bad has happened!

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,120
It's Mountain Spirit Temple.

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,600
Mountain Spirit Temple.

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Mountain Spirit Temple?

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Everything started
from Mountain Spirit Temple,

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,840
so it will end there as well.

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Wait.

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,040
By now,

44
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
we should've reached
Mountain Spirit Temple.

45
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Father, I'm scared.

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
The fog came again.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
Could it be like last time?

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
What should we do now?

49
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,880
Don't be afraid.

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,840
Mountains and rivers of the land
stretch from west to east.

51
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,520
Sand emerges and goes through the gorge.
It determines fortune or misfortune.

52
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,560
The twenty-four mountains are divided
into forward and reverse directions,

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,120
searching for the traces
of fortune, misfortune, yin, and yang.

54
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,280
Little Tag-along?

55
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,840
Help!

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,320
- Help!
- Yue Xiang loved you so much.

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,120
How could you do that to her?

58
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,100
It wasn't me.

59
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,060
I didn't do it.

60
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,940
It was Li Juntao.

61
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,700
It was them.

62
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
It had nothing to do with me.

63
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,200
I wasn't involved.

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Not me.

65
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
Do you remember this pen?

66
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,820
I... I do.

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,260
This is the love token
Yue Xiang gave you.

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
You actually threw it away.

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,040
I...

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,700
It's my fault.

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,460
I beg of you.

72
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,220
Please let me go.

73
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,140
I'll do anything you say.

74
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll give you anything you want.

75
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm begging you. Please release me.

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,040
I want you to admit

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,160
that you caused Yue Xiang's death.

78
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,380
I will. I'll admit anything.

79
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,280
I'll admit it.

80
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
I brought harm to her. I did.

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm a scoundrel.

82
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm an animal.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,160
I'm begging you. Please release me.

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,240
Please. I don't want to die.

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,880
Since you've admitted it,

86
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
I'll send you

87
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
to marry Yue Xiang.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,680
No!

89
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,440
I did what you said.

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,280
You can't go back on your word.

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
Don't do this to me.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,320
It's my fault. Please don't kill me.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
They're here?

94
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Job well done.

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,160
Don't be impulsive.

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,360
Calm down.

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,260
Xiuzhi.

98
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,040
Help me.

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,800
Stay still, everyone.

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,920
- Zixuan! Father, help Zixuan.
- Calm down first.

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,200
If anyone dares come closer,
I'll burn him.

102
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,640
Stay back! Now!

103
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Since everyone's here,

104
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,340
tell them how you caused

105
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,080
Yue Xiang's death.

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
What has happened?

107
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320
Actually,

108
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,040
this isn't Yue Xiang's revenge.

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,240
Mountain spirits don't exist at all.

110
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
All of this

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,320
is your plot, isn't it?

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,520
When did you find out?

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
You took advantage of Little Tag-along's
face, which resembled Yue Xiang's,

114
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,760
to create an illusion
of Yue Xiang's revenge

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
and fooled people

116
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
with the tale of mountain spirits.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
However, your mistake was

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,920
using Little Tag-along.

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,640
What do you mean?

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Tailor,

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,680
Yue Xiang was your most
cherished friend, right?

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,880
If so,

123
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
how could you

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,600
stay so calm

125
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,440
when you saw her in the tailor shop?

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,680
Why is she wearing that?
Why didn't you sell it to me?

127
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,640
Yue Xiang?

128
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,240
Welcome.

129
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,200
Zhang Beichen,

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
you're smart,

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
but that's not enough.

132
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,960
You can't save them.

133
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,640
Since you still refuse to confess,

134
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,280
I'll send you to atone to Yue Xiang.

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,640
You can't kill him. He's innocent.

136
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Innocent?

137
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,760
How is he innocent?

138
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
To cozy up to the rich and powerful,

139
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,920
he endangered his own fiancee,

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,680
- Ms. Yue Xiang.
- I didn't.

141
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,240
I didn't.

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,120
I had nothing to do with that trollop.

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Don't listen to him, Xiuzhi.

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
You're still denying it.

145
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Fine.

146
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,160
I'll tell them.

147
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,090
Bravo!

148
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,109
