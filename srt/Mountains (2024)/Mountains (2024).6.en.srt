Yue Xiang.

Yue Xiang.

5
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,600
Yue...

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
How could you do that?

7
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,880
Zixuan.

8
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,600
Trust me.

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,960
I didn't do that.

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,880
They did.

11
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
They bullied me.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Please believe me,

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,760
Zixuan.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
I can't believe you just said that.

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,920
Zixuan,

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,360
please believe me.

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,680
Yue Xiang,

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,960
do you believe me?

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,120
Yue Xiang.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,920
(I wanted to take Li Juntao
down with me)

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
(but I didn't expect...)

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Listen,

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Guo Zixuan.

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,120
I've already done what you asked for.

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
Can't you even get me

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,960
a position now?

27
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:46,855
It's not that.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,040
Juntao,

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,800
I only wanted you to ruin
her reputation,

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,320
I never wanted her to die.

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,640
You were saying otherwise

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
when you wanted to
get rid of that trollop.

33
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,120
Now that she's dead,

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,040
and you're trying to deny it?

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
No, I'm not.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
She killed herself.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
It had nothing to do with us.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,040
I'll tell Xiuzhi about your request.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,720
You're shameless.

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,320
Zixuan,

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
is that true?

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,160
No.

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,200
Don't listen to him.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,360
I didn't do that.

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
Still denying it?

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,320
I'll send you to meet Yue Xiang.

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,280
Zixuan!

48
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,920
Ghostly threadworms?

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,760
So those weren't hair.

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,080
They were the bodies
of ghost threadworms.

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Arrest him.

52
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,920
Yes.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,520
Don't go!

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,840
Today, you'll witness

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
my wedding with Yue Xiang.

56
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Father.

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
- Father.
- Step back. Hurry.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,920
Move the injured to the side.

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
Step back, all of you.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,320
Guo Zixuan must die.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,480
You weren't...

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Is anyone here?

63
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,360
Little Tag-along.

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,080
What are you doing?

65
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,800
I don't want you to get hurt.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,200
He taught me to let go of hatred,

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,000
to stop blaming others,
to change myself.

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,480

you can brag about the shot a lot.

80

I...

81
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm the greatest detective in Anyang.

82
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
In this world,

83
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,960
the one with love cannot love,

84
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,440
- It's all right.
- while the one who has it destroys it.

85
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,040
If he loved Yue Xiang that much,

86
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,400
why didn't he marry her?

87
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,440
It's not that he didn't want to,

88
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,200
but he couldn't.

89
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,860
(Yue Xiang)

90
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,880
(Sorry,)

91
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,480
(if I had expressed my feelings
for you,)

92
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
(you wouldn't have died, would you?)

93
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,440
Because he was born impotent.

94
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
Poor him.

95
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,480
Exactly.

96
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,040
Except for him,

97
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
probably no one believed Yue Xiang.

98
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
Trusting someone

99
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
can be easy.

100
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,880
By the way,

101
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,720
why did he suddenly become so powerful?

102
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
It's the ghostly threadworms.

103
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,400
They gave one

104
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,720
a power surge in a short time.

105
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,120
They are a very poisonous kind
of parasite.

106
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
After a long period of parasitism,

107
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
ghostly threadworms
breed in large numbers

108
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,080
and form thread-like shapes, like hair

109
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,520
enveloping the host until they die.

110
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Burning ghostly threadworms' bodies

111
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
produce thick smoke.

112
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,120
If absorbed,

113
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
it causes illusions.

114
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,000
We encountered
the ghost marriage procession

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,800
in the mountains a few days ago

116
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
because of that?

117
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
Maybe.

118
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,480
But why did he have such a thing?

119
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Is Little Tag-along's situation

120
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
caused by this as well?

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,760
It consists of both mother
and child worms.

122
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,280
The ones in Little Tag-along's body

123
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
might be the larvae.

124
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,200
They can only control her behavior.

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
The toxin isn't strong.

126
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,560
However,

127
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,800
if the mother worm dies,

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,200
the larvae shouldn't survive.

129
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Help her.

130
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,640
How?

131
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,840
All living beings
with Yin and Yang coexist,

132
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,560
the counterpart
to ghostly threadworms should be

133
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,160
Blood Spirit Grass.

134
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Blood Spirit Grass can save her.

135
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,080
- Blood Spirit Grass?
- Blood Spirit Grass?

136
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,760
Where is the Blood Spirit Grass?

137
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,400
I have it.

138
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Give it to me.

139
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,960
Rest well.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll take care of the old man.

141
