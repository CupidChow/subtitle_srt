3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,360
Chen.

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,080
Chen.

5
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,320
Wake up.

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
- Chen.
- I'll do it.

7
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,840
You want to pull me right, right?

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,840
Something's wrong with this temple.

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,960
What's wrong?

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
We're stuck in a loop.

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,480
Chen,

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,880
are you sick?

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,600
This temple enshrines...

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,360
Donghuang Taiyi.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,240
This drawing

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,840
depicts the legend
of the Golden Crow and the Fusang wood.

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,760
Where can we find the Fusang wood?

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,680
It's written here.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
- To witness the true divine,
- To witness the true divine,

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
- pay respect to the mountain gate.
- pay respect to

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,640
the mountain gate.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,800
Someone set up

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,080
a formation here.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,720
After this,

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,080
something will happen outside.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,320
How do you know?

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
This is my fourth time
experiencing this.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520
What should we do?

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Take this.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,920
Don't go out.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
If you go out now,

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,840
we'll have to go back
into the loop again.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,160
Chen,

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,080
what is this?

35
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
If the coin stops,

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,240
it means we get rid of the loop.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,560
Ling'er,

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,840
guard the door.

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,600
Sure.

40
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,700
Mountains and rivers of the land
stretch from west to east.

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,720
Sand emerges and goes through the gorge.
It determines fortune or misfortune.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,620
The twenty-four mountains are divided
into forward and reverse directions,

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,099
searching for the traces
of fortune, misfortune, yin, and yang.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
The way out is in the water.

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,640
There's no water here.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,280
Don't tell me it's this water tank.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,500
The directions of gorge, radiance,
shake, open, bound, ground, field,

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,240
east, south, west, north,
center, and force.

49
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,180
That's right.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,320
This should be it.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,099
How do we leave this place
through the water tank?

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,040
Normally,

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,160
in hypnosis,

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
one wakes up from extreme fear.

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,120
Like jumping off a cliff?

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,040
But that's how hypnosis works.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,200
We haven't figured out how this
formation operates yet. We must tread carefully.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,320
Trust me.

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,240
Zhang Beichen.

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,520
I can't.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
I can't hold on till the last.

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,520
I need help.

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,840
They're breaking in any moment now.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,120
Tianhong.

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,840
Leave it to me.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,840
I have faith in you.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,040
Master?

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,160
Master!

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Master.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,990
The formation is broken.

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,080
We've broken the formation, right?

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,920
Zhang Beichen,

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,560
why were you the only one who noticed?

74
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,760
We didn't sense the loop at all.

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,080
And you just broke the formation
like that.

76
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,000
What's the theory behind this?

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm not sure,

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,760
but I think

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,540
it has something to do with my necklace.

80
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,240
My grandfather once told me

81
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
this is a piece

82
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
of meteorite from beyond.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
It carries its own energy

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,400
that helps me resist
external interference.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,680
Then why did you fall
for Ma Tianhong's trick?

86
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,560
That was hypnosis.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
It's a different case.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,320
Is it so hard to admit
someone is better?

89
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,680
Let's go.

90
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,360
Why is there such a long tunnel
behind the door?

91
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,840
Will it be safe?

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,280
Don't be afraid.
We'll find out once we get out of here.

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
Looks like

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,200
this is Tang Valley.

95
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
That must be the Fusang wood.

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Let's go.

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,520
So this is the Fusang wood.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,400
As expected of the successor
of Zhang Tianzheng.

99
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,720
You're smarter than your grandfather.

100
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
You're not dead.

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,760
You're a mountain roamer.

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,280
How could you not know cold fire cicada?

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,200
Cold fire cicada?

104
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
They move with the wind

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
and stop when it ceases.

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,000
You would be fine if you didn't move.

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
However, I didn't expect you

108
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
to break the formation

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,040
set up by Zhang Tianzheng

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,920
and let me see the Fusang wood again.

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,200
It turns out

112
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
this is all your plan.

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Yes.

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
If Zhang Tianzheng hadn't sealed
the Fusang wood,

115
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,400
I wouldn't need to find you.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,040
Today,

117
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
I must take the Fusang wood away.

118
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,040
For the sake of Grandfather, I won't let you.

119
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,640
Ms. Duan, what are you waiting for?

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,920
Duan, what are you doing?

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
Do you really think

122
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,300
she came here to find out
the truth of her birth?

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,840
She's the heiress of the Huanlong clan.

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Huanlong clan?

125
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Put your knife down.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Put your knife down.

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760
Knife down.

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,520
Come here.

129
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Sorry.

130
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
I lied to you.

131
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Ms. Duan.

132
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Why?

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,720
Duan,

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,000
did Luo Sanyou threaten you?

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If anyone bullies you,

136
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,520
we can help you.

137
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
I was ordered by the clan head

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
to force you into this

139
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
and take the Fusang wood.

140
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,640
Go take it now.

141
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,960
Yes.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you hate me,

143
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,400
shoot me.

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Otherwise, I'm taking the Fusang wood.

145
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,000
Ms. Duan, what can you do with the Fusang wood
even if you take it away?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,640
Don't you want to know

147
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
the truth about the Jinwu Incident?

148
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,880
Duan.

149
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,520
Forget it.

150
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
It seems

151
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,280
everything is predestined.

152
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,120
Let's leave.

153
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
What about your grandfather?

154
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,000
We'll find another way.

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,160
Are we leaving just like that?

156
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,480
Ms. Duan,

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,280
here.

158
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,920
Wait.

159
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
The cripple has the Phoenix Gall.

160
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,280
Phoenix Gall?

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
However, obtaining the Fusang wood

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,480
could cost you

163
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,680
dear.

164
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
What cost?

165
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,720
Wait.

166
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
It's not that simple.

167
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,280
Don't touch it!

168
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,640
