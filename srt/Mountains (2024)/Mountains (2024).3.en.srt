3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,240
I'm bushed.

4
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Your idea was terrible.

5
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,600
Searching around places
where rich people frequent, huh?

6
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,040
Zhang Beichen,

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,800
my entire month's salary

8
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,000
is gone in just one night.

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,800
Poor me.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,160
You have to spend money

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,360
to crack a case.

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,440
That's how things work.

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
The point is we didn't crack the case.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,880
Where do you think
this brat could've run off to?

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,960
Who knows?

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,160
Is he dead?

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,120
Bah!

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,160
Don't jinx it.

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
If he dies, I'll lose my job.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,160
Your little tag-along is missing.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,880
Who knows?

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Perhaps she remembered something

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
and went back home.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,480
Forget it.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,400
I need to rest now.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,720
She's back.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,200
Roasted chicken.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,080
It's for you.

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Oh, you're quite thoughtful.

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
I told you.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Good things happen to good people.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,440
A roasted chicken from Guangde Inn.

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
Too bad!

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,760
Too bad!

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,720
Don't panic.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,640
- Speak slowly.
- Captain.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
Li Juntao is dead.

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Zhang Beichen,

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
you jinxed it!

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,640
Let's go.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
Don't gather here. Move aside.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Captain.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,040
It's hair again.

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,960
The same killer?

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,040
Captain Bai,

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,320
it has nothing to do with me.

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,480
This man died in your place,

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
and you said it has nothing
to do with you?

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
You own this rice store, don't you?

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
I don't know

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,040
what has happened.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
Come.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,680
Send Mr. Guo back
to the police station for tea.

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
- Yes, sir.
- Wait.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
No.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,880
- Move.
- It has nothing to do with me.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm innocent!

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,520
The way they died is the same.

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,920
It must be the same killer.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,480
Not necessarily.

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,720
It might be a coincidence.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,560
He looks the same as Cao Hai,
who died at the Mountain Deity Temple.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
He must've offended
the mountain spirits.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Where is it?

65
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,320
Mayor.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
What's your problem?

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Someone died yesterday,

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
and Sir Li's son died today.

69
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,880
How am I going to explain to him?

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,040
You cops should just quit your job.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,800
Please calm down, Mayor.

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,040
We'll definitely
investigate this thoroughly.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Please calm down, Mayor.

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,920
About this matter...

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
Shut up.

76
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,800
Did I ask you?

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,680
Just stand there silently
if no one asks you to speak.

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,560
Yes. Right.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,680
I said you did way better,

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
and you're getting cocky, eh?

81
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
You did way better? Heh.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,080
What are you doing?

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,440
I want him to listen to you.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,560
Something's wrong with her.

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,600
What's that mental woman doing here
at the crime scene?

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,920
Mayor,

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
please give me two days.

88
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,040
Just two days.

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,520
I'll get to the bottom of this.

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,760
You said so yourself.

91
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,920
Mayor,

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I'll make sure
the mission is accomplished.

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,800
If you can't do that,

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
I'll hold you accountable.

95
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,760
Two days.

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,560
What two days?

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,200
You heard that, right?

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,680
Resolve the case in two days.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
I doubt it can be done in two days.

100
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
We have you here, right?

101
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,120
Grandfather.

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Time to take your medicine, Grandfather!

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Beichen!

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,320
Grandfather.

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,160
Two days.

106
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,200
Only two days.

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Old man,

108
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
we have a roasted chicken.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,120
Roasted chicken!

110
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
Where is it?

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,120
Where?

112
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,280
It smells great.

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,200
It's a ghost!

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Ghost!

115
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
Please don't take me.

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,560
Please don't.

117
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,320
Don't take me.

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,000
You do look like a ghost.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,520
Come.

120
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
Let's get you some new clothes.

121
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Please listen to me, chief.

122
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Bai Yushan,

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
If you don't want this job, just leave!

124
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,040
Chief, he's suspicious.

125
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Suspicious?

126
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,920
He's the mayor's son-in-law.

127
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,200
The wedding is in two days.

128
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,360
You decide.

129
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,920
You...

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,640
What happened?

131
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
You scared me.

132
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
The chief says

133
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,000
Guo Zixuan is the mayor's son-in-law,

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
and he wants me to decide.

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
You decide, then.

136
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,920
That won't do.

137
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Wait.

138
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I pay you a lot

139
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
not for you to talk nonsense.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,720
Also,

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,880
Guo Zixuan was so cocky

142
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,920
at the tailor shop.

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
He's so irritating.

144
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Tailor shop?

145
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,860
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)

146
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,380
(Why is she full of joy?)

147
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,620
(Why is she full of joy?)

148
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,080
I see.

149
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,760
What's it?

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
Sir, are you busy?

151
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
You're here.

152
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
I made new western style clothes.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,320
It should fit this lady very well.

154
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,160
It costs two silver coins.

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,320
Fair price. Great dress.

156
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,240
Sir,

157
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,560
you're so skilled.

158
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
Try any of these if you like.

159
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,680
Go on.

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,920
Try on a few.

161
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,300
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)

162
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,580
(Why is she full of joy?)

163
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Sir,

164
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,760
you like posters?

165
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,560
You don't usually watch
opera performances, do you?

166
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
That's the owner of Fanhua Theater,

167
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,760
Yue Xiang, Ms. Yue.

168
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Ms. Yue?

169
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
(Why is she full of joy?)

170
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
Is she that famous?

171
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
I've never met her.

172
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,480
She's dead.

173
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
It's been three years.

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,520
You look great.

175
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,280
Even better than last time.

176
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,700
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)

177
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
(She really looks like her.)

178
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
(Could this be a coincidence?)

179
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,640
Beichen,

180
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,480
you're here.

181
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,320
I've been searching everywhere.

182
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,880
What happened?

183
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,840
Just now,

184
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,440
Li Juntao's bodyguard

185
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,360
came to the station
and explained everything.

186
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,480
Last night, Li Juntao

187
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,920
met with Ms. Meng from Fanhua Theater.

188
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,000
Fanhua Theater?

189
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,220
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)

190
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
Shan.

191
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,640
Pay up. Let's go.

192
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Two silver coins.

193
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,160
Can you spend less money?

194
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480
Ms. Meng,

195
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,840
Li Juntao came to you last night, right?

196
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,160
(Meng Xue, Fanhua Theater)

197
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,960
He did.

198
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,680
Why did he come here?

199
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,280
It's nothing.

200
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,000
We just had a chat,

201
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,560
and then he left.

202
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
What did you talk about?

203
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
What did we talk about?

204
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,720
Let me think.

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
We talked about stars,

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,840
the moon,

207
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,920
roses,

208
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
and Shakespeare.

209
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,520
Ms. Meng,

210
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,960
please cooperate with us.

211
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,040
And also something romantic.

212
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,680
Officer Bai,

213
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,200
do I have to tell you every single word?

214
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,680
He's dead.

215
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,320
Aren't you sad?

216
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,880
It wasn't anything serious between us.

217
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,360
Anyway,

218
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,280
when he left,

219
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,640
he was still breathing.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Yue Xiang?

221
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,480
Ms. Meng,

222
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,160
do you know Yue Xiang?

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,240
We're old acquaintances.

224
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
You see, Yue Xiang

225
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,880
was the star of Fanhua Theater.

226
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,080
She was famous and rich.

227
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,440
Why did she kill herself?

228
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,960
I know.

229
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
At first,

230
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,160
Guo Zixuan was going to marry her.

231
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,280
But suddenly,

232
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
for some reason,

233
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
rumors spread

234
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,480
about her being unfaithful,

235
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,880
so Guo Zixuan dumped her,

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,280
and she hung herself.

237
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,840
Guo Zixuan again.

238
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,520
Why did she have to kill herself?

239
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
No one believed her?

240
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,880
Captain,

241
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,480
Guo Zixuan made bail.

242
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,280
He made bail?

243
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Who approved that?

244
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,160
It's the chief.

245
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,320
Chief...

246
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,720
Chief, I see.

247
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
The mayor's daughter,

248
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,320
Ms. Zheng came personally.

249
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,520
The chief couldn't turn her away.

250
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,560
What should we do now?

251
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Nothing.

252
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,960
He's left.

253
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,160
It's difficult

254
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,040
to arrest him again.

255
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
What if he kills someone else

256
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
again?

257
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,520
Shan,

258
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Guo Zixuan

259
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,560
is getting married soon.

260
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,080
Why does he commit murder right now?

261
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,480
You're right.

262
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,760
Why would he kill now?

263
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
Ghost, back off!

264
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,520
Ghost, back off!

265
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,520
Ghost, back off!

266
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,800
Ghost.

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,840
Mr. Zhang, stop making mischief here.

268
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
She's not a ghost.

269
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
- We haven't caught the ghost yet.
- Stop staring at me.

270
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Back off.

271
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,680
Grandfather.

272
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,480
Don't look at me.

273
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll do it.

274
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,520
Back off!

275
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
All right. The ghost ran off.

276
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,120
Go to bed now.

277
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,320
One day has passed,

278
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,600
but we haven't found anything yet.

279
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,520
Shan,

280
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,600
do you remember

281
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,760
I told you this?

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
The heaven and earth have their laws.

283
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
All living beings
follow their own patterns.

285

Guo Zixuan, and Meng Xue.

286
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,280
There must be some connection

287
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
