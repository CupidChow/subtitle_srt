3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,000
Ms. Duan.

4
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,360
Ms. Duan!

5
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,040
Zhang Beichen,

6
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,920
I know you're here.

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,640
Duan Siyan!

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,440
Zhang Beichen!

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,800
Chen.

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Duan.

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,520
Zhang Beichen!

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Zhang Beichen,

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,880
did you run off?

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,920
I'm not going anywhere.

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm right here.

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,440
Zhang Beichen.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
Zhang Beichen!

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
She can't hear me.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,520
Got it.

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,920
Toads are of water in the Five Elements.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,280
Ma Tianhong,

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,720
since you used water,

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,440
I'll counter it with flame.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,160
I don't believe I can't break through
your illusion.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
Water is Yin, and fire is Yang.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,000
Metal shall create balance.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,520
Three Yang meridians rise
from the earth, moving against the flow.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,150
Three Yin meridians descend
from the sky, moving along with the flow.

29
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,360
Yang meridians flow in reverse,

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,640
Yin meridians flow smoothly.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,640
Zhang Beichen!

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Ms. Duan,

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
use the necklace.

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,000
Watch out!

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,040
Zhang Beichen.

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,000
Zhang Beichen.

37
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
Zhang Beichen.

38
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Chen.

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,480
Duan.

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Chen.

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Chen.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,680
Zhang Beichen.

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,080
Why are you here?

44
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,480
After you left,

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,280
I was suddenly surrounded by smoke.

46
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,440
When I opened my eyes,

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
I was here.

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
It seems

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,080
all of this is Ma Tianhong's hypnosis.

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,000
He sent us into a deeper layer
of the dream realm.

51
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
Ling'er said

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,640
hypnosis is similar to dreaming.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,880
Therefore,

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,120
if we want to wake up,

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
we need a strong stimulus.

56
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
Young Master Zhu?

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,320
Please take this back.

58
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,320
I've always had a feeling

59
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,560
that it led me to you.

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Do you trust me?

61
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
I trust you.

62
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Are you all right?

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm good.

64
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Where's Ling'er?

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Ma Tianhong.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
As expected of mountain roamers.

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
You woke up so quickly.

68
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
But how did you figure it out?

69
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Coffee.

70
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
You probably don't know

71
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,440
that Ms. Duan

72
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,960
has a keen sense of smell.

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
You've been around us

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,240
to hypnotize us,

75
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,480
and that's why

76
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
Ms. Duan could always smell

77
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
the coffee on you.

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
I think there's more.

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,760
Of course.

80
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,960
We showed up here
and disrupted your plan,

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
so you decided

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,400
to use the silver coin

83
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
to hypnotize us.

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,640
The night is too long to fall asleep.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm sorry to disturb your night.

86
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,600
I think I should make a bet first.

87
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
I don't like being passive.

88
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,320
It's a shame

89
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
you overlooked one thing.

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
When I first met Second Madam,

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,960
she wasn't wearing the amulet.

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
But you didn't know that,

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,120
so you restored it in the hypnosis.

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
Second Madam left her amulet

95
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,840
in the woodshed.

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
The murderer of that maid

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
is Second Madam.

98
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,480
How could that be?

99
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Zhang Beichen,

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,360
have you lost your mind

101
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
under hypnosis?

102
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
It seems

103
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
you were never part of her plan

104
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
from the start.

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Where do you think we are now,
in reality or a dream?

106
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,240
Chen.

107
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,440
Chen.

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,440
Why is he here?

109
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,320
Impossible.

110
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,620
This is impossible.

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,280
When you noticed
my consciousness weakening,

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
you decided

113
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,840
to enhance the hypnosis on me,

114
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
trying to push Ms. Duan and me

115
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,560
into a deeper layer of the dream realm.

116
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,200
But you didn't realize

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
you were also trapped

118
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,120
in a dream of this realm as well.

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
Just like us,

120
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,720
you're trapped in the first layer
of this dream realm.

121
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,160
If so,

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
I'll try the needle on you.

123
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,960
Why isn't it working?

124
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
Forget it. I'll try it again.

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,880
Don't tell me you didn't notice

126
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,040
the scratches on the maid's neck.

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,960
You suspected her from the beginning,

128
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,120
but you didn't admit it.

129
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,260
I'll use it on you now.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
What did the Zhu family do?

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,990
Why are you so determined
to kill all of them?

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,360
You can take it back. Keep it safe.

133
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,640
Duan.

134
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,160
Chen.

135
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,560
How did you wake up, Ling'er?

136
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,600
Didn't I tell you

137
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,520
hypnosis is similar to dreaming?

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,200
Something scared me in the dream

139
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
and then woke up.

140
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
Ling'er probably didn't enter
the second layer of hypnosis.

141
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
That's why she woke up earlier.

142
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Ling'er,

143
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,600
wake him up.

144
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,680
It's time to let him face reality.

145
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,640
All right.

146
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,880
What do you say?

147
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Am I right?

148
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,160
This smell

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
is found in everyone in the Zhu family.

150
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,620
It's Ghost Ginseng Powder.

151
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
Ghost Ginseng isn't toxic,

152
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,099
but breathing in substantial amounts
causes hallucinations.

153
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,640
Oh,

154
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
no wonder I couldn't figure it out.

155
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,960
She added it to your incense.

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,960
Do you still trust her?

157
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,400
When you noticed
my consciousness weakening,

158
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,960
you decided

159
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,960
to enhance your hypnosis on me.

160
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
How did it go?

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,480
They seem to be waking up.

162
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
Your incense.

163
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,720
Tianhong,

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,840
