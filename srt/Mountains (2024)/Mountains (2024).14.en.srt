=Episode 14=

3
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,000
Master,

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,940
didn't you say there was
no Sinister Suppression?

5
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,320
What's happening now?

6
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,000
Mr. Zhu,

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,400
how could there be no grievance?

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,280
It's snowing.

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,980
There must be unresolved injustice.

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,760
Looks like

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,920
there are more than two boxes
in this residence.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
Master,

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
I'll go check on First Madam.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
Zhang Beichen,

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,840
you're right.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,560
There's more.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
I found this in a side room.

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,680
Chen,

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,440
I found a box

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,800
in the kitchen.

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,060
(Woodshed, blood-eyed maid)

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,700
(Beheaded butler, main gate)

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,660
(Side room)

24
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,660
(Kitchen)

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,440
(Woodshed, bloody-eyed maid, beheaded butler,
main gate, side room, kitchen)

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,840
It's four corpses lifting a coffin.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
This is a malicious curse.

28
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,600
(Eyeless)
The curse caster tortures an animal

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,920
to make the cursed person
die in the same way.

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,600
(Zhu's Residence)

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,840
(Headless)
There are already two corpses now.

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,560
What?

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,280
Mr. Zhu,

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
it seems someone

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,080
is really trying to kill

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,800
everyone in the Zhu family.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,360
What...

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
This is bad, Master.

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
First Madam is injured.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
Madam.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,000
Madam.

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,320
The front leg is gone.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
It matches again.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,840
Chen,

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,800
do you think

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
this place is haunted?

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,880
That's the box I just took
from the kitchen.

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,640
Why has it

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
suddenly appeared here?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
There's no such thing.

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,480
Zhang Beichen,

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
how many more lives do you want to harm?

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
Mr. Ma, please take a look.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,560
It must be that resentful maid.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
Mr. Ma, please help me!

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,360
What a fence-sitter you are.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
He's right.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,840
This is one of the Sinister Suppressions,
four corpses lifting a coffin.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,160
This curse

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
is cast by a ghost.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Didn't you say that she killed herself?

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Yes, she did.

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,200
But...

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,880
There's a reason for every outcome.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,560
What did you do to her?

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
I'll tell you.

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,160
Master.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Are you still working?

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,400
I'll get back to rest
after cleaning this up, Master.

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,760
Well done.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,280
Good job, Cui.

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,800
Good job.

73
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,620
Please don't do this, Master.

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,200
I haven't finished my work yet.

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,760
Master.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,400
No, Master!

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,800
Cui.

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
No, Master!

79
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,000
As long as you're obedient,

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll give you everything you deserve.

81
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,240
Keep it.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
Here. Put it on.

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
First Madam.

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,960
You vixen,

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,840
how dare you seduce Master!

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
I didn't, First Madam.

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
I really didn't.

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,360
First Madam.

89
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm going to gouge your eyes out.

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,960
No, please!

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,960
My eyes!

92
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,880
Then, she killed herself.

93
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Mr. Ma, please help me.

94
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
I don't want to die.

95
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
Please start the ritual

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,360
and disperse her soul.

97
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
It's too late now, Mr. Zhu.

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,360
The Sinister Suppression
has begun to work.

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm afraid

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,140
there's nothing more I can do.

101
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,040
Didn't you say
it's four corpses lifting a coffin?

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,480
There are only two dead now.
There's still a chance.

103
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,160
Mr. Ma,

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,320
name your price.

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,760
I'll give you whatever you say.

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,680
Ma Tianlong,

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,600
you...

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
Are you actually after money?

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,880
Hey.

110
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,920
He's Ma Tianhong.

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,200
Besides,

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,760
the Ma family of the Northeast
is a prestigious family.

113
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,080
He won't go this far just for money.

114
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
You're doing this

115
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
for revenge, right?

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,800
Revenge?

117
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,640
Please forgive me, immortal.
Please forgive me, immortal.

118
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,040
You wet-behind-the-ear,

119
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,480
how dare you speak ill of me.

120
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm doing good deeds,

121
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,240
but you slandered me.

122
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,480
I will not

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
spare you.

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,880
Please forgive me, immortal.

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
What's going on?

126
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,660
Something must be wrong with him.

127
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Chen,

128
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,680
do you think he can
really invoke the fox spirit?

129
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,400
I think it's just his tricks.

130
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,840
There's a strange smell here.

131
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,980
Did you not smell it?

132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,960
What's that?

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,200
The smell of coffee on Ma Tianhong.

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,960
No.

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
That's strange.

136
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,440
He's not here,

137
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,160
but the smell of coffee won't go away.

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,280
What are you looking for?

139
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,640
The amulet.

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
It's gone.

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
It seems like

142
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,280
we're trapped in an illusion
by Ma Tianhong.

143
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,320
Chen,

144
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
how are you sure this is an illusion?

145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
The amulet probably

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,880
doesn't belong to the maid

147
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,560
but to Second Madam.

148
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,040
The Second Madam we saw just now

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
is an illusion.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,920
To be precise,

151
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
since the moment
Ma Tianhong showed up here,

152
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,160
we've already been trapped
in the illusion.

153
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,120
The night is too long

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,160
to fall asleep.

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,040
I'm sorry to disturb your night.

156
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
But he didn't know

157
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
that Second Madam had left her amulet
in the woodshed

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,920
and even that

159
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,120
I found it.

160
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,400
That's why Second Madam
is still wearing it in the illusion.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,720
But in reality,

162
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,400
the Second Madam we saw

163
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,120
wasn't wearing the amulet.

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Master,

165
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,640
my Second Madam is weak.

166
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,720
I'd like you to escort her
back to her room.

167
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,160
No wonder

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,600
Second Madam kept touching her wrist.

169
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,280
How did the girl die?

170
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,240
Master Zhu said

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,720
she was driven to kill herself
by First Madam.

172
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
Other than that,

173
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,320
I don't know.

174
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
So,

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,880
what we see now is an illusion.

176
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,720
It's what Ma Tianlong wants us to see.

177
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,880
I get it now.

178
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,160
I thought

179
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,300
he used some kind of drug
that can create hallucinations

180
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,040
but it seems the drug was merely an aid.

181
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,960
He has been using
all kinds of hints on us.

182
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,880
The method he used to
trap us in the illusion

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
is hypnosis.

184
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Hypnosis?

185
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,320
It's a therapeutic method from the West.

186
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
It allows one to fall asleep

187
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,940
and heal one's condition.

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Consider it as a dream.

189
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
We've entered a dream realm.

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
My master studied this before.

191
