00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,880
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

4
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,560
Rock, paper, scissors.

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
What's that?

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,200
Is that one?

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,480
I wanted to play the scissors.

8
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Come. Let's play again.

9
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,000
He adopted two children?

10
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,560
But I didn't see them
when we were here last time.

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,480
It was late.

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,960
They probably had gone to bed.

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,160
No wonder he loves money.

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,120
He's lively now.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,120
He doesn't look like he's dying.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,320
Ling'er,

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,960
is this a mistake?

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,600
I genuinely

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,320
read his pulse.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,880
He can't make it past 30.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,320
Is he past help?

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,760
Unless

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
the Great Golden Immortal helps him.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
That explains why he didn't tell Ms. Su

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
even though he liked her that much.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,760
Back then, your grandfather
came to my master,

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,920
asking her to go to Tang Valley
with him

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,640
to look for

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,120
Fusang wood to save his junior.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,640
Unexpectedly,

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
my master has never come back
since then.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
She only left a map behind.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,520
Since Master Guan knew
it was a dangerous trip,

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,600
why would she agree

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,120
to go for the sake of others?

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
She did it for me.

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,760
See? I told you.

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,640
My diagnosis is correct.

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,620
If I hadn't looked for Tang Valley,

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,040
nothing bad would've happened
to Wan Yang and Weiwan.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,660
Did you really find Tang Valley?

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
I followed the map
and reached Tang Valley.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
But that place is strange.

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,800
It seems to have a barrier.

45
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,320
I searched for two years
but couldn't find the entrance.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
So we came here for nothing?

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,600
Mr. Ma would at least find something, right?

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,760
That's right.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,640
There was another survivor back then.

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
Was it a cripple?

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,520
How do you know?

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,080
A cripple

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,680
has been following us along the journey.

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,320
However,

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,640
whether they're a friend or a foe,

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
we're not sure yet.

57
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,800
Whether they're a friend or a foe,

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
we'll find out there.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
By the way, Ma Tianhong,

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,480
I won

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
our bet, right?

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,120
Make your demand.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,040
Take us to Tang Valley.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,180
Take you to Tang Valley1

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
That's fine,

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
but you need to pay me.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
Seriously?

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
You lost the bet,

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and you're asking for money?

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,920
I can take you to Tang Valley,

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,880
but I never said it'd be free.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Well.

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,080
Making a bet with me

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
is your great pleasure.

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Fine. I'll pay you.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,473
(Mo has the trunk of an elephant,
the eyes of a rhino, the tail of an ox,)

77
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:00,950
(and the feet of a tiger.)

78
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,838
(It lives in the valleys in the south.)

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,598
(Sleeping on its skin shields against maladies,
while hanging it avoids bad luck.)

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,540
(From "Praise to Mo's Screen")

81
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,340
(Mihe Town)

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,300
(Forest)

83
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,640
Almighty Mo deity,

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,080
please forgive us.

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,280
We're willing to offer
another sacrifice.

86
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Please devour our misfortune

87
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,280
and bring us blessings.

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,520
Bring us blessings.

89
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,760
Please, high priest!

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,120
Please spare my husband!

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,680
Please spare my husband.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Who are you?

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,080
Get out. Don't make a mess here.

94
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,360
Take him and offer to the deity.

95
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,400
I beg of you, sir.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
What are you doing?

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
He's chosen by the Mo deity,
but he refuses to go up to the mountains.

98
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,080
We'll be doomed.

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,560
Exactly.

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,440
We'll be doomed.

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,180
Tell me about it.

102
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,760
Right. He'll bring us harm.

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,800
He'll bring us harm.
He must be up to something.

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,200
What kind of stupid deity is that?

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,080
You're hurting his life.

106
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
He's cursed with bad luck.

107
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
If we offer him to this mountain,

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
not only will our bad luck
be taken away,

109
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
but it will also bring them
lasting happiness.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
Why is that bad?

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,480
Why is that a bad thing?

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
No matter who he is,

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
he's a human.

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
Is the Mo deity

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,960
the Dream Eater Mo?

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
It looks like a pig.

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
Watch your mouth.

118
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,360
Who are you, ignorant brat?

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,100
How dare you disrespect the Mo deity!

120
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
Chase them away.

121
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
Leave right now.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Right! Leave this place.

123
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Are you insane?

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,800
I must wake you up with my needles.

125
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,000
Ms. Duan, should we intervene?

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,680
We're just passersby.

127
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,280
We have to intervene.

128
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,000
Folks, listen to me.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm a mountain roamer.

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,760
People like me

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,560
explore the world.

132
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
No one knows these mountains

133
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
better than I do.

134
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,360
How about

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,680
I look into it for you

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,880
and find out if this Mo deity is real?

137
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,560
- Who are you?
- Does it even concern you?

138
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,240
Tell me about it. Who are you?

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,480
How can we believe you?

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Does this have anything to do with you?

141
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,720
Leave.

142
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,760
Amidst the mystic universe,

143
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,520
a troop travels west to east.

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,960
Ma family of the Northeast?

145
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Please help my husband, immortal!

146
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Please, immortal!

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
He's from the Ma family
of the Northeast.

148
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,520
Immortal.

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Please help my husband, immortal.
I beg of you.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
They trust me.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,480
They don't trust you.

152
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,440
Shut up if you have
nothing important to say.

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,600
We've been walking for so long,
but haven't seen anything yet.

154
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,520
Is that thing

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
really helpful?

156
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
Looks like

157
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,360
I need to measure again.

158
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,900
Mountains and rivers of the land
stretch from west to east.

159
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,920
Sand emerges and goes through the gorge.
It determines fortune or misfortune.

160
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,840
The twenty-four mountains are divided
into forward and reverse directions,

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,300
searching for the traces
of fortune, misfortune, yin, and yang.

162
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,280
This is strange.

163
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
Why hasn't it shown any reaction?

164
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,960
Whoa. So beautiful.

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,720
Fireflies?

166
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,480
Why are there fireflies

167
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
in this season?

168
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,760
Ling'er!

169
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,040
Why am I back home?

170
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,240
Beichen,

171
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,080
come and eat something.

172
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,400
Ms. Duan?

173
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,520
Why are you here?

174
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
What are you talking about?

175
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
Are you sick?

176
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Am I

177
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
dreaming?

178
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
Grandfather?

179
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,720
Grandfather, you've gotten better?

180
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm perfectly well.

181
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm making toys
for my future great-grandson.

182
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
Both of you

183
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,560
have been married for a long time.

184
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm more anxious

185
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
than you.

186
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,160
Married?

187
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
I...

188
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
Do you also think

189
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,800
something's off today?

190
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,200
What is it?

191
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,040
You've been acting strange
since you woke up.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Today is Grandfather's birthday.

193
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,240
Did you forget?

194
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,560
Birthday?

195
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,200
I've booked a private room

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
at Yun Restaurant to celebrate.

197
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,980
You said you wanted to prepare his present.
Did you also forget this?

198
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,480
Me?

199
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,120
I've already gotten it prepared.

200
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
I knew you'd forget.

201
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,720
Have some.

202
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,400
- Bravo! Excellent!
- Nice!

203
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,640
- Beautiful!
- Fantastic!

204
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,720
Good!

205
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
Please be seated.

206
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
All right.

207
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,280
Great!

208
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,800
- Good!
- Amazing!

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,880
Beichen,

210
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,960
what are you looking at?

211
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,920
Nothing.

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,600
I saw a familiar face.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,160
Maybe it's a mistake.

214
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
So much delicious food.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,440
You're so sweet, granddaughter-in-law.

216
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,560
You're thoughtful.

217
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,400
As long as you like it, Grandfather.

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,160
Of course.

219
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,840
Here comes the roasted chicken.

220
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,280
Roasted chicken from Guangde Inn.

221
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,120
Please enjoy.

222
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,160
Grandfather,

223
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
this is your favorite, Guangde Inn's...

224
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,080
Roasted chicken.

225
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,280
My favorite is

226
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,440
(Yun Restaurant)
Guangde Inn... Very good.

227
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,960
Isn't this Yun Restaurant?

228
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,120
Beichen.

229
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,840
Beichen.

230
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Beichen, bring the gift over.

231
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,000
Beichen.

232
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,880
Hurry up.

233
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,880
Grandfather,

234
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,600
I hope you live up to be 100.

235
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Thank you.

236
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,980
That's not the proper way
to send blessings.

237
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Grandfather, I wish you perfect health

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,360
and a long life.

239
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
Thank you.

240
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,120
I'm getting up in years.

241
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,440
I can't remember my birthday.

242
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,880
I didn't know

243
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
you had prepared a surprise for me.

244
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,840
That's good.

245
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,000
Very well.

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,640
Beichen,

247
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
open the gift.

248
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,520
What's wrong?

249
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,360
No.

250
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,880
Nothing.

251
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,120
Open it.

252
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,000
Do you like it, Grandfather?

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,560
I like it.

254
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,240
Ms. Duan!

255
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,880
