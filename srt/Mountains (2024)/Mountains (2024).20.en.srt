=Episode 20=

3
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,320
Chen,

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
what kind of flower is this?

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
This is Rilun Mulan.

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
It's a man-eating flower.

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,480
Its pollen glows like fireflies,

8
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
but it's poisonous.

9
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,120
If a person approaches it,

10
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,680
it can cause hallucinations at best
and death at worst.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,600
Do you think the mushroom soup noodles

12
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,120
used this mushroom?

13
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,600
Yes.

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,160
This is Mei mushroom.

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,760
It grows in the same area
as Rilun Mulan.

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,760
It's addictive but not poisonous.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,840
If Rilun Mulan's pollen falls on it,

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,840
it becomes toxic.

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,760
Don't you know the mushrooms
are poisonous?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,440
I...

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,400
I just want to...

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,640
This mushroom is as dangerous as opium.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,240
You...

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,640
Get out of here now.

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
The place has been shut down.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,600
The boss lady used poisonous mushrooms

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,560
and poisoned a general's son.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
She was shot. Leave this place.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,740
(Tomb of Yun, My Beloved Wife)

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
Can one mend regret?

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,240
What needs mending

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,240
isn't regret itself

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,780
but the part of the heart
that's been lost.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
The part of the heart that's been lost.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
As the cripple said,

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
"We only have one life to live.

37
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't leave yourself with regrets."

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
Instead of dwelling on the past,

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
it's better to live in the moment.

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
Go ahead and do what you want to do.

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,760
Would the cripple

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
be the priest
who spread rumors that day?

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,080
He was acting strange.

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,360
As expected of the Ma family
of the Northeast. Immortal!

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Please save my husband, immortal!

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,880
Let's go and meet him.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,400
No matter what,

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
let's find him first.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,120
Who are you?

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
Grandnephew,

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
you've finally found me.

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,800
Who are you?

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,080
Zhang Tianzheng took you
to pay respects to me before.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Why?

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,680
You forgot?

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
You are

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,880
Luo Sanyou.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,760
Why have you been following us?

59
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
It was him.

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,880
Drink this.

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,300
Who's there?

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
Stop chasing.

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,920
I advise you not to go to Tang Valley.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a place you would not
be able to return from.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
So you were harming all of them

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,040
to stop us from going there?

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,560
That's not fair.

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm a cripple.

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
What could I do?

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
It was all coincidence.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,240
I saw you give Ghostly Threadworms

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,720
to the tailor.

73
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,780
(Mountain Spirit Temple)

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
I saved his life.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,960
If not for me,
he would've died long ago.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
He only thought of killing himself

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
after the woman he liked died.

78
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
Shouldn't those be the ones
to die instead?

79
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
What about the chef's Mei mushroom?

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,960
Was it from you as well?

81
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,600
He found it by himself.

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,160
I told him not to dwell on it,

83
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,100
but he wouldn't listen.

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,560
What's your reason

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
for the Corpse Feng?

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
That's a little deal

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,200
between me and Chen He.

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,720
I taught him how to take revenge,

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,560
and he showed me
where to find the Phoenix Gall.

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,780
(Tomb of Mu Lian)

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,160
Using the Phoenix Gall
inside Mu Lian's body for your deal?

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,440
Exactly.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,920
Hand it over.

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,800
Do you really think

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,080
the Phoenix Gall
can cure your grandfather?

96
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,240
What's that supposed to mean?

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,960
Only Fusang wood can save him,

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,760
but you shouldn't go there.

99
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Why not?

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,560
Not just anyone

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
can enter that place.

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,680
Only Zhang Tianzheng can open that door.

103
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
What else do you know?

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,360
I only know that,

105
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
except for me,

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,680
everyone else died,

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
and Zhang Tianzheng

108
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,960
went missing.

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Zhang Beichen,

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,160
I don't care what the situation is like
in Tang Valley, I must find out the truth.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,560
Luo Sanyou,

112
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
take us to Tang Valley.

113
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,880
I told you

114
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,780
that's a place you wouldn't be able
to return from.

115
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm informing you, not negotiating with you.

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
Since you insist,

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,080
I can only risk my life for it.

118
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,080
We're leaving tomorrow.

119
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Let's drink.

120
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,940
No one can say for sure
what will happen to us after tomorrow.

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,760
Let's drink to our fill tonight.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,120
Never thought

123
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,640
that before I die, I'd meet a bunch of

124
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,320
weirdos.

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,760
You're the weirdo.

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
There's no need for words. Let's drink now.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
This liquor isn't cheap.

128
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,400
Don't take mine.

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,160
Ma Tianhong,

130
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,160
don't be so obsessed with money.

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,880
Come.

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
We've been through a lot together.

133
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,980
Let's drink together.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
Kiddo, you can't drink.

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
Who are you calling a kiddo,

136
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,200
Ma Tianlong?

137
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm Ma Tianhong.

138
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,760
Is your overhead Hucheng judged
based on height?

139
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,320
You haven't seen
how great my thirteenth needle is yet.

140
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,320
Then you should show me.

141
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,640
My thirteenth needle

142
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,960
strikes straight into the throat.

143
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
I can't just show you anytime.

144
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,700
You're not convinced?

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
No.

146
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,200
Wanderers in the martial arts world
would at least take a few hits.

147
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,880
I'll cut you down in three strikes.

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,960
Drink.

149
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,680
Let's drink.

150
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm not drinking.

151
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Come again.

152
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,560
Sure.

153
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm not scared of you.

154
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,680
You're really something, young girl.

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
You know what?

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,840
I can drink like a fish.

157
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,160
I can drink two more jars of this.

158
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Pour it.

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,400
You're not even as tall as my neck.

160
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,320
I thought you were a good drinker.

161
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,560
I've overestimated you.

162
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,400
Forget it.

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,720
Well.

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
You love money

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
and can be a little slouchy,

166
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,960
but you're a good person.

167
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,040
If I had the choice,

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
I'd like to meet you

169
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,640
once again.

170
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
Without threats,

171
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,280
hatred,

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
or the truth.

173
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
It would be like

174
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
two strangers

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,580
catching a glimpse of each other
in the crowd,

176
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
and many stories could happen
between them.

177
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Trust me.

178
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
Trusting someone

179
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
can be easy.

180
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,440
Sometimes,

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
I wonder

182
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,520
if it's better
not to remember everything.

183
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,800
It's nice to be
a simple little tag-along.

184
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,560
But some things

185
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,920
are predestined.

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,120
As you said,

187
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,280
there's no need to mend regrets.

188
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,160
But there's a part of my heart
that's lost.

189
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
If

190
