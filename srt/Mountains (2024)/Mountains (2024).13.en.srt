=Episode 13=

3
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,920
Mr. Ma,

4
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,240
my wife passed out!

5
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,320
Please check on her.

6
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,560
It's the resentment spirit.
Set up the altar and start the ritual.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:09,920
(Zhu's Residence)

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,640
Butler,

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
call for Second Madam.

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,120
Spirit Hall is the universe where heaven,
earth, and true forms reside.

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,800
Spirit Hall is made of greed and anger,

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,960
divided into Yin and Yang.

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,960
Life in the South, death in the North.

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,360
The supreme law
of life and death comes late.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,880
Immortals and deities from five paths
have arrived. Now, back off, wandering spirits!

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
Master,

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,400
how is it?

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,720
Mr. Zhu,

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,640
whether or not
the resentment is dispelled

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
depends on now.

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
If all the bowls crack,

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
it can be

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
resolved.

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,320
It's you.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
Your petty tricks

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,000
aren't enough to catch my attention.

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,160
Chen.

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
Chen.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,480
You're awake.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,720
What's going on?

31
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,720
We were drugged.

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,760
Something's wrong with his pipe,

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,320
but I haven't figured out

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
what it is.

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
What exactly does he want?

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,200
No matter what it is,

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
he's the only one who knows
where Tang Valley is,

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,760
so he has to come with us.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,560
Hucheng?

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,000
I've underestimated you.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
What do you mean?

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
Who are you?

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,250
Get out of here right now.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,600
Don't disturb Mr. Ma

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
while he's lifting this...

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
This...

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Sinister Suppression?

48
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, Sinister Suppression.

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
That's what Mr. Ma called it.

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,840
Sinister Suppression is simply nonsense.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,760
Ling'er,

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,460
show him what you've got.

53
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,720
Five needles on the Shen meridian
as the Ghost Path,

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,760
fire needles in three fiery strikes.

55
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
It's a ghost!

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,200
You're indeed an amazing physician.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,760
Madam wasn't possessed,

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
she was poisoned.

59
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,120
How could she possibly be poisoned?

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,320
You'll have to ask her
if she touched anything.

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,760
Mr. Ma,

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
you're not being honest.

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,560
If it weren't for this gentleman,

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,820
you would've taken
five hundred silver coins from me.

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,960
Whoa.

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Five hundred silver coins?

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
Mr. Ma,

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,120
it's not wrong to make money,

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,160
but not in this way.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,440
Mister,

71
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,560
here's my token of gratitude.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,920
Please accept it.

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,280
By the way, Mr. Zhu,

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,000
I suggest

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,760
changing the feng shui
in your residence.

76
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,120
A better environment

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,440
eases your mind,

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
and so

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
your family will be at peace, right?

80
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,080
Are you capable of that as well?

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
If so, I shall thank you.

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
I'll have my butler prepare
rooms for you.

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,960
Master,

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,120
my second madam is weak.

85
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,280
Could you please escort her back
to her room?

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,160
Where are your servants?

87
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Something happened yesterday.

88
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,360
Except for the butler,

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,840
everyone else has taken leave.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,440
Don't we need to escort
Madam Zhu as well?

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
Ms. Duan,

92
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,160
what are you talking about?

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,080
You're carrying a rifle.

94
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
You will escort

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
the two madams back to their rooms.

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,080
All right.

97
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,320
Let's go.

98
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,960
Jeez,

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
it's such a hassle.

100
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,080
There are no servants here.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,380
I'll have to collect herbs myself.

102
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Thank you.

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,560
Thank you, master.

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
I'll arrange your room immediately.

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
Mr. Zhu,

106
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,440
I think

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Mr. Ma should stay as well.

108
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,880
Just in case
some sinister presence appears.

109
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,480
That's right. Good thinking, master.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
Mr. Ma, please stay.

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll arrange rooms for you now.

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
We're competitors.

113
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,080
What's your plan for keeping me here?

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,980
It's nothing. I'd like to
make a bet with you.

115
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,800
On what?

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Let's bet on

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
who can catch the ghost
in this residence first.

118
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,960
Sure.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
Aren't you curious about the stake?

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,400
I won't lose.

121
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,520
Chen,

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,000
is he really the person
we're looking for?

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
He seems like a fraud.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
That's what I think, too.

125
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,560
Anyway, let's see if
I catch the troublemaker first,

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
or if he catches the ghost first.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's go.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,999
Do you think
the Sinister Suppression really exists?

129
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,720
Zhang Beichen said it wasn't real.

130
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,080
You trust him a lot?

131
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,120
(Trust me.)

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,720
Keep it safe.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
I'll get it back.

134
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,400
Your necklace

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,120
is unique.

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,480
It's a gift from him, right?

137
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,280
He pawned it to me.

138
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,920
Second Madam,

139
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,720
how did that girl die?

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Master Zhu said

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,400
she was driven to kill herself
by First Madam.

142
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
Other than that,

143
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
I don't know.

144
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
No! Help!

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
Weiwan, come over.

146
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
It's already late.

147
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,680
I should go back and rest.

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,920
Well, I won't send you off then.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Take care.

150
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,160
Hold on.

151
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
It'll keep you safe.

152
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,880
Ten silver coins.

153
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,960
Yes?

154
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
Isn't this Ma Tianhong's?

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,440
I found it in the woodshed.

156
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,280
If this belonged to the maid,

157
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
both of them might've known each other.

158
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
What did you find out from her?

159
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
Second Madam said

160
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
the girl was driven to death
by First Madam.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,960
There were scratches on her neck,

162
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,640
so she didn't hang herself.

163
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
Could it be

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,700
that Ma Tianhong seeks revenge for her?

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
If that's the case,

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
Ma Tianhong isn't an indifferent person.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,440
It's a shame
that using evil against evil

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,640
isn't a good way.

169
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,840
Zhang Beichen,

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,240
why do I sense
that you're implying something?

171
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,920
How could I do that?

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,480
Ms. Duan, you're magnanimous,

173
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,400
right?

174
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,240
You're willing to uncover the truth
from back then with me.

175
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
I couldn't thank you enough.

176
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,840
You're way better than that Ma fellow.

177
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm very curious.

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,320
Why does nothing seem to startle you?

179
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,120
Let me tell you something.

180
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,320
It's because I can

181
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,080
predict the future.

182
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,280
The last time I saw you smile

183
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,720
was when you were Little Tag-along.

184
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
Ms. Duan,

185
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,200
don't move.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,360
When I first met Ma Tianhong,

187
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,000
why was his shadow a fox spirit?

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Do immortals really exist?

189
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,960
Well,

190
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
no matter what,

191
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,160
we have to find out more about him.

192
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,200
And how do you plan to do that?

193
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
The night is too long

194
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,520
to fall asleep.

195
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm sorry to disturb your night.

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,520
You're watching us.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm bright and upright.

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Underhandedness isn't my thing.

199
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm here for you.

200
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,440
For me?

201
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,280
I came here for...

202
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,280
Aren't you

203
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,240
that Ma Hong?

204
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Ma Tianhong.

205
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
What are you doing here?

206
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,880
Ma Hong.

207
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,480
I've been thinking about this.

208
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
I think I should make a bet first.

209
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,920
I don't like being passive.

210
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Zhang Beichen,

211
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,320
even if I'm going to deal with you,

212
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll do it right in front of you.

213
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,920
Sure, I'll wait for it.

214
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,440
Girl, you should go after
the person who harmed you.

215
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,800
Take it out on the Zhu family.

216
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,160
Don't come for me.

217
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,840
