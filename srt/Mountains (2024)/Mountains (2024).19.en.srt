00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,040
Ma Tianhong,

5
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,120
have you seen a chef

6
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,920
in Ling'er's dream?

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,240
There was a waiter.

8
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,320
Is he a chef?

9
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,640
Why are you so concerned about a chef?

10
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,480
None of us have seen this chef before.

11
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,800
Roasted chicken from Guangde Inn.

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,480
Please enjoy.

13
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,480
But he's appeared

14
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,080
in all of our dreams.

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
Congratulations on your big day, sir.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,520
He should be the one
who controls everything.

17
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,880
In that case,

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,480
we should enter his dream

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
to save everyone.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
He's controlling all our dreams.

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
He's not like us.
He won't be easy to control.

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Right.

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,200
Entering someone else's dream
puts us on the line.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
If we want to break his dream,

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
we need to enter his subconsciousness,

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,640
which is very dangerous.

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,840
I'll go.

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm coming, too.

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,440
Ling'er,

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,480
stand guard for us.

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,040
All right.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,780
I'll use the Thirteen Ghost Gate Needle Technique
to help you, just in case anything happens.

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,160
Are you ordering me?

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,760
Beg me.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,240
Please help me,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,600
dream master.

37
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,200
(Tomb of Yun, My Beloved Wife)

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,360
No matter what you encounter
in the dream,

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,280
don't interfere with his fate.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
Now,

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,880
I'll send you into his dream.

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,520
Did you forget what Ma Tianhong said?

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
It's cold out here.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,040
Come inside and eat.

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,120
Looks like

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
the fireflies are guiding us.

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Do you like the dishes?

48
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,360
Please have more if you like them.

49
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Please eat well, everyone. Enjoy the food.

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Do you like the dishes?

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Yun, could I have more noodles?

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes, of course.

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
Come. Serve noodles.

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,440
This is good.

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,200
Please try it out.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
Be careful.

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,400
Hurry and give it a try.

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,800
Your noodles smell great.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,480
Who made them?

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,520
It's our new chef...

61
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Our chef.

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,880
He dislikes her?

63
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,560
No.

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,600
It's because he likes her
that he dares not to get close to her.

65
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,560
Feel free to tell me if you want more.
I'll have him make more for you.

66
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,860
Hurry and prepare some more. Go.

67
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
Go to the kitchen
and prepare a few more bowls.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
- Go.
- All right.

69
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,840
Why would he buy something so expensive?

70
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Liking someone

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
makes one feel inferior.

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,200
Yun.

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,600
Don't you know
the mushrooms are poisonous?

74
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
I just want to...

75
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
The mushrooms are as dangerous as opium.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,480
You...

77
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,100
Get out of here right now.

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,200
No, Yun. I...

79
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Get lost now.

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,320
Scram! I don't want to see your face.

81
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
It's the cripple again.

82
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,920
You regret it.

83
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Tell her before it's too late.

84
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,880
You only have one life to live.

85
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Don't leave yourself with regrets.

86
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
Who is

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,200
this cripple?

88
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,480
What are you doing here?

89
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,200
Officer,

90
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
what's happening?

91
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,440
This place has been shut down.

92
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,680
The boss lady used poisonous mushrooms

93
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,000
and poisoned a general's son.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She was shot.

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,440
Leave.

96
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Now.

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Yun.

98
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,920
Yun.

99
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Yun!

100
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,120
Yun,

101
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
I was blinded by greed

102
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
and took a shortcut.

103
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
Yun,

104
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,720
I shouldn't have used
the poisonous mushrooms.

105
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,600
Yun chased him away

106
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,920
and took the blame for him.

107
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,520
Why did she do that?

108
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
It's simple.

109
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,480
She loved him.

110
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,880
Yun.

111
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,540
- I got it.
- I got it.

112
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,720
What did you find out?

113
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
Quick. Send us to Yun Restaurant.

114
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,640
Oh,

115
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,360
you're quick. You almost catch up to me.

116
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,140
Stop your nonsense.

117
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,600
Quick.

118
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,520
Hypnotize us.

119
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,400
I told you this is delicious.

120
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
To thank you all for coming,

121
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,680
my husband and I

122
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,720
have prepared

123
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,800
a never-ending feast.

124
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,560
Please enjoy as much as you can.

125
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,920
Come on. Let's eat.

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,920
Guests,

127
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
please come inside.

128
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,320
What would you like?
We serve all kinds of food here.

129
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,760
I'd like a bowl

130
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,380
of mushroom soup noodles.

131
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,120
We don't serve that here.

132
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,240
But I heard

133
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Ms. Yun's mushroom soup noodles

134
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
are famous.

135
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,920
You aren't here to eat.

136
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,680
Who exactly are you?

137
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,920
This is an illusion.

138
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,640
Leave it to me.

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,560
Yun,

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,920
kill him.

141
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,800
From a thousand mountains,
plants gather vital energy.

142
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,280
A flying star enters the nine palaces.

143
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,280
Break!

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,760
Yun!

145
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,560
Why?

146
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,400
Why did you all hurt her?

147
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,800
Do you want to keep her trapped here
for good?

148
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,560
The never-ending feast
is just an illusion,

149
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,640
but Yun

150
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
shouldn't your puppet.

151
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
Nonsense!

152
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Give Yun back to me!

153
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,520
Give her back to me!

154
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,000
She's never been gone.

155
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,840
She's always been by your side

156
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
in her own way.

157
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
My dear.

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,720
My dear.

159
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,280
This is your favorite noodles.

160
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,150
Eat it while it's hot.

161
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,720
Thank you

162
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,400
for letting me taste it again.

163
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,880
Let's go.

164
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,960
We should leave

165
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,260
this troubled place.

166
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,580
All right.

167
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,300
(Yun Restaurant)

168
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,840
Run now!

169
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,720
Actually, I can't leave.

170
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,600
I've already been devoured
by this thing.

171
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,960
This is bad.

172
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
They're in danger.

173
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Where's the chef?

174
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,640
He's already merged

175
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,880
with a tree.

176
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,160
This tree is him.

177
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,120
Where are we now?

178
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,640
- Let's leave.
- Come on.
