3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,440
Ms. Duan.

4
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Ms. Duan...

5
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,480
Duan Siyan.

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,720
Duan Siyan.

7
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,400
It can't be resolved
by external influence.

8
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
I need to enter their dream.

9
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm sorry, man.

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,080
Excellent!

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,680
Amazing!

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Fantastic!

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
Ma Tianhong?

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,000
Weiwan.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,880
Fantastic!

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,240
- Bravo!
- Amazing!

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
Excellent!

18
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Great.

19
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
- Fantastic.
- It's worth the trip.

20
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Well done.

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,560
Do you enjoy my performance?

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,200
I do.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,520
A heart-wrenching song sings,

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
where can I find someone
who knows my heart?

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Who is he?

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,620
Someone who knows you.

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm the owner of Amazing Pictures,

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,240
Jia Keqi.

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,680
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Ma.

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
I'd like to invite you to join us
in the next movie.

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Mr. Zhen...

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,720
It's Mr. Jia.

33
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,600
Mr. Jia,

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
moving pictures are flashy things.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
They don't earn much recognition.

36
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,760
I value real skills.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Mr. Ma,

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
you're an artist.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Thank you.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,160
Weiwan,

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,240
I'm a bit tired.

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,720
Mr. Jia,

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,600
please.

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,320
All right.

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,920
This brat

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
really thinks he's an artist.

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,200
Weiwan,

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,680
do you like my performance tonight?

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Yes.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
As long as it's you performing,

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
I'll like it.

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
The night sky is beautiful.

53
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,000
Ma Tianhong.

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Where did you go?

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,200
I...

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,300
Talk about perfect timing.

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Mr. Zhang,

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
bring the car here.

59
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,040
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,540
It's not your first day
working as my driver though.

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,000
Wait.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Do you really think you're a big star?

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
- What...
- Tianhong,

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,400
Mr. Zhang has been with you
for many years.

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
Please don't mind him.

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,100
Weiwan, I'll listen to anything you say.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
I'll deal with him.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
I'll be right back.

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,720
Sure.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Mr. Zhang, you...

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,960
Have you seen stars before?

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Stars?

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,960
Time to

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
wake up.

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,120
You slapped me.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,880
I didn't.

77
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,040
You must've dreamed it.

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
What's going on?

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
If we want to leave this place,

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
we must either wake ourselves up

81
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,560
or enter someone else's dream

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
to wake them up.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,580
What should we do now?

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,680
You save Ling'er,

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
I'll save Duan Siyuan.

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Hey. Swear you're not doing this
for your own intention.

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,640
Hurry up.

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Ms. Duan.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Wait for me.

90
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,840
What?

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Is this

92
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Wei Ling'er's dream?

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,480
Mr. Ma,

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
our boss

95
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
would like to watch your performance.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,720
Zhang Beichen?

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
Why are you here?

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
Have you seen Wei Ling'er?

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,320
How dare you call our boss by her name.

100
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
What are you on about?

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,580
Don't interrupt me.
I'm looking for Wei Ling'er.

102
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,840
Are you performing or not?

103
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Why should I?

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
You slapped me?

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
Are you performing or not?

106
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm not performing.

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
Let go of me.

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Are you performing

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
or not?

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
No!

111
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,720
What's going on?

112
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
It's nothing.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Let's go.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,840
What is this?

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Sir.

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,280
Congratulations on your big day, sir.

117
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,280
What's this?

118
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
Why did you lift the veil?

119
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,240
Little Tag-along.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
I told you

121
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,720
to stop calling me that.

122
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,840
Call me Ms. Duan instead.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,560
Since you've married into my family,

124
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,120
you should know the house rules.

125
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Wait.

126
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,120
Did I take your family name?

127
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,600
You know

128
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,200
the house rules.

129
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
First,

130
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,760
obey me.

131
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
Second,

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,560
obey me.

133
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,680
Third,

134
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,280
obey the first two rules.

135
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
You're the one who dreamed of me,

136
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
so don't blame me.

137
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,120
I was trying to save you.

138
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Chen,

139
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,480
did you do something bad

140
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,960
in her dream?

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
It's nothing.

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,800
What did you both dream about?

143
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,520
You're a sidekick

144
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,320
in Wei Ling'er's dream.

145
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,760
She is...

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,040
Don't say it.

147
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,560
Seems like

148
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,400
you two have secrets.

149
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,680
Not really.

150
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,800
We all are thinking the same thing.

151
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,480
The same thing?

152
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,060
We all wanted to boss you around.

153
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,960
Enough chit-chatting.
We should figure something out

154
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,400
to save these people.

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
There's a strange smell here.

156
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,820
(Tomb of Yun, My Beloved Wife)

157
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,040
Over here.

158
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,920
It's around here.

159
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Tomb of Yun, My Beloved Wife.

160
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Chen,

161
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,360
could it be spirits or demons again?

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,120
You're at it again.

163
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,920
