00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,520
Siyan!

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,560
Don't move.

5
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,160
Little...

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,940
Little Tag-along.

7
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,480
Something's wrong with the Fusang wood.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,640
Back then, Master and the others
killed each other

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,380
because of the influence
of the Fusang wood.

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
My grandfather once told me

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,440
this is a piece

12
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,200
of meteorite from beyond.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,800
It carries its own energy

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
that helps me resist
external interference.

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,760
Little Tag-along.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,200
Chen.

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,240
Duan Siyan, I didn't know
you were this kind of person.

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,000
Why didn't you run away?

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,800
I lied to you.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,520
Why did you save me?

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,840
You said

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,320
if after we reached Tang Valley,

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,160
we still had a chance to be companions,

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
we'd start over.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,560
You weren't drunk.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,200
If

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,400
after we go to Tang Valley,

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
we still have a chance
to be companions,

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
let's reintroduce ourselves.

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,800
With it around,

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
I can't get drunk.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Why wasn't he affected?

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
Phoenix Gall.

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,960
The phoenix suppresses the Golden Crow.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
He's taken the Phoenix Gall.

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Luo Sanyou,

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,640
you know something's wrong
with the Fusang wood,

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,020
yet you still wanted me to hold it.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,460
Are you trying to betray
the Huanlong clan?

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,480
You actually treat them
as your family, huh?

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,920
You suspected me long ago, didn't you?

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
Why do you still believe

43
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,960
I'd work for them?

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,880
Grandnephew,

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
finally, you've found me.

46
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,520
You are?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
How naive you are,

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,800
Ms. Duan.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,560
The Fusang tree should've been mine
all along.

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
What do you mean?

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
Haven't you always wanted to know
who you really are?

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll tell you.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,640
How much do you know?

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,600
Back then, before we departed,

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,040
Zhang Tianzheng entrusted you
to the Huanlong clan.

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
Later, he went crazy,

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
so the Huanlong clan adopted you.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,800
You're Zhang Tianzheng's granddaughter.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,640
That crescent birthmark on your hand
is proof.

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,640
Even though he's gone crazy,

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,680
he recognized you.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,440
Grandfather,

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,960
why are you holding a bowl of soup?

64
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Drink it.

65
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,240
Drink it.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,320
The real murderer of the Jinwu Incident

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,960
is the Huanlong clan.

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,120
Duan is Mr. Zhang's granddaughter?

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
Chen, you...

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,280
Are you siblings?

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,680
As the matter stands,

73
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,440
there's no point in hiding anymore.

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,080
Now I remember.

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,840
There was an orphan back then,

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
but it wasn't you.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,520
It was you,

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,280
Zhang Beichen.

79
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,240
I didn't expect

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,360
the successor token of Tang Valley

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,560
to have such power.

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,080
I don't care

83
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,000
whose child I am.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,560
Zhang Tianzheng
is always my grandfather.

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,640
You've been lying to me.

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Why would I lie?

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,160
Not just you,

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,720
all of us are the Huanlong clan's pawns.

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
Please grant me medicine, Huanlong clan.

90
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Mr. Duan. Please grant me medicine, Mr. Duan.

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,240
Mr. Duan.

92
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,800
Your junior sister's condition is beyond cure.

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,280
I don't have such an antidote for her.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Mr. Duan,

95
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,640
I heard the Huanlong clan
has many precious treasures.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,880
Among them, the Dragon Scale Powder
can cure her.

97
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
I have dragon scales,

98
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,540
but as for Dragon Scale Powder,

99
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
I don't have that.

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Duan, please think of a way.
You must have something, Mr. Duan.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
Please think of a way. Mr. Duan.

102
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,320
That being said,

103
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,800
if you could find the legendary

104
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
purest Yang existence,

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Fusang wood,

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,720
and use its flame

107
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,400
to refine the dragon scales,

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
you will get Dragon Scale Powder.

109
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
Fusang wood?

110
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,960
I got it.

111
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
Thank you, Mr. Duan.

112
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,120
Xuanbing Lake can preserve her body from rotting.
Don't worry, and start your journey.

113
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,080
Thank you, Mr. Duan.

114
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,680
But after I escaped a narrow death,

115
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,520
I realized everything
was the Huanlong clan's plan.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
They never intended to

117
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,680
help my junior.

118
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,320
They just wanted to use me
to find Fusang wood

119
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,800
for their benefit.

120
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Since they didn't help me,

121
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
I wouldn't let things go their way.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,240
I must save my junior.

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
You're despicable.

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,640
Yes, I am.

125
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,520
Zhang Tianzheng is a good man.

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,720
All the Four Strange Gates know that,

127
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,800
but he didn't save our junior!

128
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,760
Where's the Phoenix Gall?

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Tell me, where's the Phoenix Gall!

130
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,940
I gave it to someone else.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,240
What did you say?

132
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,500
I gave it to someone else.

133
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,120
How could you give it away?

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,280
It can save our junior!

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,640
My junior was deadly sick,

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,990
and he went to search
for the Phoenix Gall,

137
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,720
yet he gave it away.

138
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,200
Even after finding the Fusang wood,

139
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,080
he sealed it again.

140
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,800
He didn't even want his granddaughter.

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
He raised someone else's child instead.

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,280
What a kind man he is.

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,120
Ms. Duan,

144
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,880
now the truth is right before you.

145
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,240
It's

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
your call.

147
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,360
Give me the Fusang wood.

148
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,160
What?

149
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Give me the Fusang wood.

150
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,280
You still want to help
the Huanlong clan?

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
Fusang wood can cure Zhang Tianzheng.

152
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,480
Ling'er.

153
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,440
I see.

154
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,680
Tianzheng, you're as
impressive as you were.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,520
You actually use the magnetic field
of the Fusang wood to set up another formation.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
We're still in his formation

157
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,520
Very well.

158
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,920
You had a chance before this,

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,480
but since we're still in the formation,

160
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,040
don't blame me.

161
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,600
Five Vicious Troops.

162
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,280
You know quite a lot.

163
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,080
Fusang wood.

164
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,660
Grandfather's formation is affected
by the Fusang's magnetic field.

165
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,480
That's why, in this formation,

166
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,160
we can get anything we want.

167
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,840
What should we do now?

168
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,320
Ma Tianhong,

169
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,200
cover me for a moment.

170
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,880
Me?

171
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,040
What am I supposed to do?

172
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120
Ma Tianhong,

173
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
use the real skills
you used to scare me.

174
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,280
What you think is what you get.

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,920
The immortal guards the horse,
traveling far and wide.

176
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,600
It roams freely across the three realms.

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
Clad in armor
and wielding a sturdy sword,

178
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,200
it strides swiftly through all lands.
