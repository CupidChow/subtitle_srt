3
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,520
Zhang Beichen,

4
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,920
where's Little Tag-along?

5
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
She's at home with the old man.

6
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
Guess what?

7
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Gu saw Guo Zixuan

8
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
meeting up with Meng Xue last night.

9
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Let's watch the opera first.

10
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,900
(Anyang Police Station)

11
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Come clean,

12
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Mr. Guo.

13
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,360
I didn't do it.

14
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,040
Meng Xue's death has nothing
to do with me.

15
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,880
Why did you meet her last night?

16
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,000
I...

17
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,920
Last night,

18
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,000
I just wanted to ask

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,200
about Juntao's death.

20
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,720
She wasn't upset at all about it.

21
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I wanted to stand up for my buddy.

22
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
I grabbed her by the neck

23
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,280
to scare her, and then I left.

24
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,040
So

25
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,920
you knew

26
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,480
about the affair between
Li Juntao and Meng Xue all along.

27
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,840
Juntao came from a well-off family,

28
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,880
so that's nothing.

29
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,840
Then why did he give you
Blood Spirit Grass

30
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,640
to cozy up to you?

31
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,080
Juntao bought out the theater

32
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,280
and invited us over tonight.

33
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
It's not good if we're late.

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,440
Right.

35
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,840
It seems he has a gift for you.

36
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,680
All right.

37
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
Let's go.

38
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
That was a greeting gift
for my father-in-law.

39
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
So you killed Cao Hai?

40
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
I didn't!

41
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,920
It has nothing to do with me.

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,560
Not me.

43
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,680
I believe you.

44
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,120
You may go.

45
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,200
Really?

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,840
Go ahead.

47
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Can I leave?

48
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,920
Go on.

49
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Why are you letting him go?

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,920
Right.

51
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Let's go, too.

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,280
Beichen,

53
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,400
how did you know the Blood Spirit Grass
was given to Guo Zixuan?

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,360
I just guessed.

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,720
Then why did you release him?

56
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
If

57
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,640
Li Juntao tried to win favor
with Guo Zixuan's father-in-law

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,200
so he asked Cao Hai
to collect Blood Spirit Grass,

59
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
and Guo Zixuan

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,440
met with Meng Xue
after Li Juntao's death,

61
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
you can guess

62
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
who's the next victim?

63
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,240
Are you suggesting

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,440
that Guo Zixuan isn't the killer

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,840
and he might be the next victim?

66
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Exactly.

67
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Besides, the killer

68
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,600
will take action soon for sure.

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Then why did you let him go?

70
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,200
These are just my guesses.

71
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,400
I don't have proof.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
Have someone keep an eye on Guo Zixuan.

73
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
"Bait the hook," have you heard of that?

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Ghost!

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,680
Chop.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
Chop.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Grandfather!

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
What are you doing?

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,360
I'm chopping the ghost.

80
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Chop.

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,480
Chop.

82
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
It's a ghost!

83
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,480
Ghost.

84
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
Why is she wearing that?
Why didn't you sell it to me?

85
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,640
I'm so sorry.

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,040
Let's leave.

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,960
What's wrong with you?

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,080
Yue Xiang?

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,920
I know.

90
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
At first,

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
Guo Zixuan was going to marry her.

92
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
But suddenly,

93
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)
for some reason,

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,320
rumors spread

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,720
about her being unfaithful,

96
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,440
so Guo Zixuan dumped her,

97
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,240
and she hung herself.

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,960
This is bad!

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Please go to the people

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,200
who owe you this.

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,840
They deserved it.

102
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm innocent.

103
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,920
It has nothing to do with me.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
You scared me.

105
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
I saved you.

106
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,880
No need to thank me.

107
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,440
Let's go.

108
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,480
What were you doing there?

109
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Why would you even ask that?

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Obviously, she is...

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,200
There are no other possibilities.

112
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,160
Could it be that Yue Xiang didn't die

113
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
but instead lost her memory?

114
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,680
If I kill someone,

115
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
what will happen to me?

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,320
You'll die.

117
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Die?

118
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,200
What does it feel like?

119
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Death

120
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,320
means you'll never see
the people you want to see again.

121
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,280
I can never see you again?

122
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Yes.

123
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't want to die.

124
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,360
I didn't kill anyone.

125
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,120
But you can't prove it.

126
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,440
All the evidence

127
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,000
is against you.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,720
Do you trust me?

129
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,480
Trust me.

130
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,880
Now, the chief believes

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,440
that all the victims were killed
by Little Tag-along.

132
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,000
Tonight,

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,280
she'll be escorted
to the provincial capital.

134
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
(Why is she wearing that?)

135
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,280
(Didn't you say this is not for sale?)

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
(At first,)

137
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,160
(Guo Zixuan was going to marry her.)

138
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,360
In a couple of days,

139
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Xiuzhi and I are getting married.

140
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
(The heaven and earth have their laws.)

141
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
(All living beings
follow their own patterns.)

142
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
(Cao Hai,)

143
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
(Li Juntao,)

144
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,200
(Guo Zixuan, and Meng Xue.)

145
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,680
(There must be some connection)

146
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
(between them.)

147
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,040
(Miss Joy. Why is she full of joy?)

148
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,520
(You don't usually
watch opera performances, right?)

149
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,640
(That's the owner of Fanhua Theater,)

150
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,880
(Yue Xiang, Ms. Yue.)

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,360
Welcome.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,720
The tailor.

153
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,640
Where are you going?

154
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,960
Keep an eye on her.

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,600
Zixuan.

156
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Zixuan.

157
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,880
Zixuan.

158
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,240
Zixuan.

159
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,940
(Yunxiang Clothing)

160
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,780
(Memorial Tablet
of My Dearest Friend, Yue Xiang)

161
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,080
What's this?

162
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,120
Where's the tailor?

163
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,360
The tailor?

164
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Someone reported yesterday

165
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,960
that he was attacked.

166
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,640
He's in the hospital now.

167
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
