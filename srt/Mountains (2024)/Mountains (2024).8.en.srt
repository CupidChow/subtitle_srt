00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Run!

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,560
Run.

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,320
Run now!

6
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,280
There's a zombie.

7
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,800
Hop in.

00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,440

(From "Classic of Mountains and Seas,
Classix of the Great Wilderness, North")

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,440
It's right ahead.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Sir,

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,240
what brings you here?

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,120
We're here to look for someone.

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,320
So many talismans here.

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,640
Did the zombies attack the village?

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,960
They came out to attack people at night.

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,720
Several have already died.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Sir,

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
please don't go out at night.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
What about you?

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
Why are you running around at this hour?

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,480
Sir,

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
my house is right up ahead.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,900
(Lianhua Abode)

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,000
Sir and Miss.

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
Thank you.

27
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
Why are you staying in the temple?

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
This is an abandoned temple.

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
The ancestors of the abode dwellers

30
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
came here as refugees.

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,040
Initially, everyone lived here,

32
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,800
but over time,

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,240
they moved away.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,160
The village head didn't want to leave,

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,240
and he's been staying here.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,640
By the way,

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
the village head is my father-in-law.

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
The villagers don't practice this,

39
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
so the village head
locks this place up.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600
There's a strong stench here.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,520
Wait.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,280
You're here as a guest.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Can't you be a bit...

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,360
A bit of what?

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,240
Don't make a fuss.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,080
Sir,

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,400
the room is here.

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
How come I can't smell anything?

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,240
Is she a dog?

50
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,160
Sir and Miss,

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
I hope you don't mind.

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,880
We only have these mats.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,720
Sure.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
It's all right.

55
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Who are they?

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,720
Father,

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,680
why are you standing there?

58
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Tell them to leave.

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,840
I ran into a zombie in the mountains.

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,880
They saved me.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,440
What's going on

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,840
with the zombies you mentioned?

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,120
A few days ago, a corpse
was dug out in the village.

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,880
Stop talking about that cursed thing.

65
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,760
Lan has died because of that.

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,280
Leave before the first light.

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm so sorry about that.

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,920
My wife died because of the zombies.

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
That's why my father-in-law
is beside himself.

70
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
It's fine.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
We understand.

72
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Well,

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,560
your father-in-law mentioned
the cursed thing.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,320
Who is that?

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,160
A couple of days ago,

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,840
a few young people dug out
an intact corpse.

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,800
Judging from the decayed shroud,

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
it must've been buried
for more than ten years.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
The cursed thing is the corpse
he was talking about.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,400
Villagers who got bitten
all have turned into zombies,

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
and that zombie ran away.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
Even my wife...

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,040
Yong.

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,600
What are you doing here?

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Didn't I tell you

86
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,400
not to run around after dark?

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Little boy,

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,960
can you show me

89
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,840
what's in your hand?

90
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,120
It's Ling'er's.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,840
Little boy,

92
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,920
where did you get this from?

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
Are you looking

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,720
for Physician Wei?

95
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,560
Yes.

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Where's she?

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Last night, Physician Wei lured
the zombies into the mountain alone

98
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,960
to keep everyone safe.

99
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,000
We couldn't find her yet.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,320
If I had been there,

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,480
I would've stopped her.

103
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,560
Let's go.

104
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,520
How do we even search
in a mountain this vast?

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
Ling'er is clever.

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,080
She must've left some clues.

107
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520
Give it to me.

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,960
What?

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
Her thing.

110
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,760
Bai Zhu,

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,520
ginseng,

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,200
and Rhodiola.

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Do you know herbs?

114
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,400
I don't,

115
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,840
but I remember

116
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
anything I smell.

117
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,860
(Ginseng, Rhodiola, unknown, Bai Zhu)

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,840
There's a strange smell here.

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,480
Ling'er is clever.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
She ground Xiaoming Grass into powder.

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Xiaoming Grass?

122
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
An illuminant herb.

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
Who is this Ling'er?

124
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
Ling'er is a ghost doctor.

125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,880
We grew up together.

126
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,400
She's been taking care

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,680
of my ailing grandfather
all these years.

128
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,960
There's no need to explain it to me.

129
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
You started this first.

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,840
Ling'er!

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
Ling'er!

132
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Ms. Duan,

133
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,560
can you try sniffing around?

134
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,840
Do you think I'm a dog?

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,680
No, I...

136
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,720
Just sniff.

137
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
The stench here is too strong.

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,880
Anyway,

139
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,080
she should be around here.

140
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
A rifle is a good long-distance weapon.

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,800
Thanks.

142
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
This is a nice knife,

143
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,440
but you've got to know how to use it.

144
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,960
This bad.

145
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,160
Tomorrow is the solar eclipse.

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
If you don't want to die,

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,920
leave this place now.

148
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,760
This Taoist

149
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,480
is quite interesting.

150
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,800
There's a cave in front.

151
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's go.

152
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Ling'er.

153
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,520
Ling'er.

154
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,040
Ling'er.

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Wake up, Ling'er.

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
Hurry.

157
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,840
Leave this place.

158
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,720
Ling'er.

159
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,640
There's a strange blood smell here.

160
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,840
There are many beasts in the mountain,

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
so that's normal.

162
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
Let's bring Ling'er back first.

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,160
Come.

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
Those zombies are poisonous.

165
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,040
I can only use
the Thirteen Ghost Gate Needle Technique

166
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,080
to suppress the toxin.

167
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Thirteen Ghost Gate Needle Technique?

168
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Yes.

169
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,520
Ling'er is a ghost doctor.

170
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,720
Her healing and poisoning skills
are top-notch.

171
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,560
Thirteen Ghost Gate Needle Technique
is her unique skill.

172
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
What's that?

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,080
This?

174
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,360
This is Hucheng.

175
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
A ringing bell physicians used
while they traveled around

176
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,800
in ancient times.

177
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,080
Over time,

178
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,600
Hucheng's position

179
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,120
also represents the skill level
of a physician.

180
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,400
The higher the Hucheng,

181
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,440
the more skilled the physician is.

182
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
As for Ling'er,

183
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,080
she's the youngest

184
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,760
and prettiest overhead Hucheng.

185
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,400
I'll do it.

186
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,480
