1
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,741
I want you to kill him.

2
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,241
Do it for me.

3
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:14,025
He always hurts me.

4
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,431
Especially when we have sex.

5
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,930
Especially when I refuse him.

6
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:30,102
Please don't do it!

7
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:41,243
I throw up every time we have sex.

8
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,985
Women are meant to be loved

9
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,587
not to be hurt.

10
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,555
Arthur is a sadist.
He wants violent sex.

11
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:07,961
He takes videos
while he forces himself on me.

12
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,670
Raping me turns him on.

13
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,316
Kill my husband.

14
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,151
Kill him.

15
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,928
Do it for me.

16
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,453
You fool. What did you say?

17
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,414
You're still talking to him?

18
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:01,999
What did I tell you?

19
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,612
You stay behind me,
not in front.

20
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,979
I almost tripped.

21
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:07,260
You imbecile.

22
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:10,674
Boss, that's enough.

23
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,109
- Boss.
- Screw you.

24
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,370
Out of my sight.

25
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,011
Okay, boss.

26
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,959
- We're sorry.
- Let's go, you two.

27
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:57,082
I've attempted to leave him
so many times.

28
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:00,057
But his threats always stop me.

29
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:02,976
He won't think twice
about having me killed.

30
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,394
I thought I had no escape.

31
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:13,231
Until I met you.

32
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:26,205
When you protected me
from that perverted customer...

33
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:45,889
I knew that you'll be
the one to save me.

34
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,308
I'm Vicky.

35
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:37,684
Ted.

36
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,508
TED: Do you want to meet up again?

37
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:40,310
You must have had
so many before me.

38
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,088
In the past, yes.

39
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,635
But now,

40
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:48,603
it's only you.

41
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:59,539
How long have you been married?

42
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,555
Five years.

43
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,347
My ambition got the better of me.

44
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:10,075
I wanted a life of luxury.

45
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:14,521
But what's wrong with that?

46
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:20,967
I was sick of living in debt.

47
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:24,854
So even if I didn't love Arthur,

48
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:27,440
I married him.

49
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,201
I thought it would be heaven.

50
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:37,580
But my life became a living hell.

51
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:45,432
I also grew up with nothing.

52
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,491
I'm an only child.

53
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,624
All my parents wanted was for me
to join the Army.

54
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,939
But it's good that
they're gone now.

55
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,218
At least they didn't get to see

56
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,446
how I ruined my life

57
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:17,350
and their dreams.

58
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:22,096
Why?

59
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,322
What happened?

60
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:28,406
I was kicked out of the military.

61
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:34,787
They caught me
having sex in the latrine

62
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,648
with the senior officer's wife.

63
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,352
And when he confronted me,

64
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:44,944
I punched him in the face.

65
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,750
You're quite the lothario.

66
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,237
It was only natural.

67
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:55,638
She came on to me.

68
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,471
But since then,

69
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,919
my life started to fall apart.

70
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,381
Then I started working for this mayor.

71
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,325
Killing became second nature to me.

72
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,748
But now I'm done with that.

73
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,166
Just this once.

74
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,985
Do it again.

75
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,986
Please.

76
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:44,317
Okay.

77
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:49,066
I'll do it just for you.

78
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,209
Every Saturday morning

79
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:03,378
he goes mountain climbing.

80
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,940
That's the only time
he doesn't have a bodyguard.

81
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:09,008
He likes to do it alone.

82
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,369
Arthur has an assistant.

83
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,031
Georgia.

84
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:57,087
Take care.

85
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,532
But don't worry.

86
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,731
Georgia is on my side.
And he doesn't know it.

87
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:15,290
She has to deal
with my abusive husband.

88
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,364
She will text you the details.

89
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,303
Arthur.

90
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:10,184
Are you sure nobody saw you?

91
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,802
Nobody.

92
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,994
I made sure he was dead.

93
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:45,949
Thank you.

94
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,630
What happens to us now?

95
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,733
People might get suspicious
if they see us together.

96
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:02,820
There will be an investigation.

97
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,591
For now,

98
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:08,284
let's stay away
from each other and wait.

99
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,724
Teddy Braganza!

100
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,684
Teddy Braganza.

101
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:20,166
Sir? What is it, sir?

102
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,706
Teddy Braganza?

103
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,575
Are you Teddy Braganza?

104
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:25,833
I am.

105
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:28,661
You're under arrest for
the murder of Arthur Gallardo.

106
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,146
I don't know anything about that.

107
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:31,497
Explain yourself at the station.

108
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:32,582
- Sir, please don't.
- That's enough.

109
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:34,412
There must be some mistake.

110
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:41,757
Sir.

111
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:43,087
Stop struggling.

112
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:49,455
The world is full of gullible people.

113
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:54,015
What if he rats you out

114
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,374
or says you ordered him to do it?

115
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,021
Who is going to believe him?

116
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:04,483
I’ll tell them
he was obsessed with me.

117
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,379
That he wanted to have me for himself.

118
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,873
And I never told him
to kill my husband.

119
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:13,306
Whatever it is you know—

120
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:14,891
I don't know anything.

121
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,916
Good.

122
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,061
I don't have any friends, Georgia.

123
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,754
I don't trust other women.

124
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:20,916
But you?

125
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:23,608
I know you well.

126
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,967
And I like you.

127
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,970
You've served me well so far.

128
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,074
- I trust you.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

129
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,887
I trust you with my secrets.

130
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,954
Don’t attempt to
make an enemy of me.

131
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,189
Of course not.

132
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,274
For you.

133
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,904
Oh, this isn't necessary.

134
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:51,887
Take it.

135
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,411
Thank you, Ma'am Vicky.

136
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:00,008
Welcome.

137
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:05,066
Call Attorney Cruz and tell him
I need some papers filed for the company.

138
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:07,062
- Yes Ma'am Vicky.
- Let's go.

139
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:35,236
Do you want the tofu and pork?

140
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,044
Can we have more pork and tofu?

141
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,633
- It's so good.
- Right?

142
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,118
This place hasn't changed a bit.

143
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:44,353
The food is still unbelievable.

144
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,077
Come on.

145
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:47,410
Let's go.

146
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:48,911
It's already raining.

147
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,352
The porridge was so good.

148
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:54,054
- Yeah. I'm so full.
- Especially the tofu and pork.

149
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,881
Nothing really changed.

150
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:57,827
We're definitely going back.

151
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,140
Look at that car.

152
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:05,165
Nice right?

153
00:24:08,974 --> 00:24:12,227
You know we'll have our own one day.

154
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,017
We'll even get one each.

155
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,961
- Really?
- Of course!

156
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:17,503
What color do you want?

157
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:18,531
Any color.

158
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:19,672
Just pick one.

159
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:20,749
Okay, fine.

160
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:21,907
Blue?

161
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:23,325
Maybe red.

162
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,571
I like red.

163
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:26,982
I don't like sad colors.

164
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,217
Why?

165
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,030
You better start learning how to drive.

166
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,952
I already know how to drive.

167
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,127
Also...

168
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,538
it's not like
we're getting one so soon.

169
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:36,759
Why?

170
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,507
Don't you believe in me?

171
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:39,837
Of course I do.

172
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:44,764
I’m done distributing flyers.

173
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,582
I look like a fool
who nobody even notices.

174
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,603
And when they do notice me,

175
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:52,980
it's because they want
to go out with me.

176
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:55,081
Babe,

177
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,933
what if I take the Saudi offer?

178
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,085
Hey, don't do that.

179
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,010
The employers there are abusive.

180
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:05,926
Do you want to get raped?

181
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:06,952
Get raped?

182
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:08,354
I'll kill them if they try.

183
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,544
We haven't made rent in three months.

184
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:20,149
I still have some money in the bank.

185
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:22,134
- Take it.
- Really?

186
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,286
No, you keep it.
You need money too.

187
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:26,347
No need.

188
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:28,032
I can do this alone.

189
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:32,019
I'll make a sale.
Don't worry.

190
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:34,230
Okay.

191
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:38,395
When can we get a ride?

192
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:32,699
Mr. Gallardo told me he loved me.

193
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:36,578
That buyer who was full of himself?

194
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:38,785
I'll kill him.

195
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,605
Sir, this is a really good investment.

196
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,315
It's a pre-selling house.

197
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,652
And I know you probably
won't live here.

198
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:48,929
But as you can see

199
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:50,522
the interior is—

200
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,179
Marry me.

201
00:26:58,631 --> 00:26:59,919
But sir...

202
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,738
I'm just trying
to sell you a property,

203
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,568
and now you say you want me?

204
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:12,327
We've only known each other
for a few months.

205
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:14,866
Usually,

206
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,137
I don't like wasting time.

207
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,948
I can marry you tomorrow.

208
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:22,817
Sir.

209
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,026
I don't have feelings for you.

210
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,433
You'll learn to love me.

211
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,729
I know you want more out of life.

212
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:46,670
I can give you all that.

213
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:50,027
Houses, cars, jewelry or gold.

214
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:51,622
Cash.

215
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,789
Sir,

216
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:59,789
I really don't have
feelings for you.

217
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:03,574
And I have a boyfriend.

218
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,051
So? You're not married.

219
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:09,546
See? You're not.

220
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,100
Sir,

221
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:18,686
you're looking at me

222
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,938
as if you want to eat me.

223
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,277
I do.

224
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:30,901
I'm starving.

225
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,202
I'll think about it, sir.

226
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,282
But if we just keep
thinking about it,

227
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:39,485
the hungrier we’ll get.

228
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,799
This is not an easy decision sir.

229
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,920
This, that, and all those—

230
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,687
If you drag your feet,
how will you make the sale?

231
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,279
We don't even have to split up.

232
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:02,633
Are you serious?

233
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,830
You're going to marry him?

234
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,903
We'll still see each other.

235
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:13,240
Let’s set a schedule.

236
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:16,994
Maybe three times a week?

237
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:20,325
I'm going to be the third party?

238
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:23,435
You think I'm a fool?

239
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,255
Vince.

240
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,025
Remember our dream?

241
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:35,220
We're going to be rich.

242
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:36,580
That will happen.

243
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,224
I'm taking the Saudi job.

244
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:43,228
Vince.

245
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,688
Don't do that.

246
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,837
I'll take care of you.

247
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:49,985
I’ll take care of your family.

248
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,553
Don't go to Saudi.

249
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,905
You do what you want.

250
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:54,114
Vince!

251
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,454
Wait, Arthur.
Hold on.

252
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:03,165
What do you mean wait?
Let's do this.

253
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:05,601
- Wait.
- I want you right now.

254
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:06,794
We're not—

255
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,937
We're not married yet.

256
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:10,339
What? So you're a virgin now?

257
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:12,324
Just lie down.

258
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,221
Arthur, stop.

259
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:14,272
Hurry. He's been looking for you.

260
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,175
You and your worthless men.

261
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,476
You haven't done a thing!

262
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:22,678
He was begging, boss.

263
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,246
He said it was only a mistake.

264
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,598
I don't care!

265
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,375
Finish him and make it clean.

266
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,460
And I don't want to hear
about this anymore.

267
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,545
Yes, boss.

268
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:38,713
My husband is a monster.

269
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,311
You didn't tell me
you were back.

270
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:58,567
I didn't want to bother you yet.

271
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,410
Our bosses were abusive.

272
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,997
They didn’t even pay us on time.

273
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:39,644
Most of our salaries
were delayed by months.

274
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,279
Maybe luck is just not on my side.

275
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,491
There’s no such thing as bad luck.

276
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:56,796
We will turn it around.

277
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:05,432
Thinking about you
was what got me through.

278
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:09,585
Your love for me.

279
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:13,696
Me too.

280
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,849
I thought about you all the time.

281
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,045
You don't have children with him?

282
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,633
We both don’t want kids.

283
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:54,133
They just get in the way
of our careers.

284
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:58,517
Why, what business is he in?

285
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,893
Construction.

286
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:06,369
My husband thrives on
under-the-table government deals.

287
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:11,079
His money is dirty.

288
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:15,949
But I don’t care, as long
as he spends it on me.

289
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:30,473
I'll buy you your own house.

290
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,365
And another one
for your parents in the province.

291
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,722
I really am your side piece now.

292
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:42,975
What else?

293
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:53,736
Our dreams are about to come true.

294
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:26,561
Babe, thank you.

295
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:31,357
I know this is not what you wanted.

296
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,968
But I'll get you that car, one day.

297
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:38,413
This is too much for me.

298
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,461
Thank you.

299
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:44,876
You know,

300
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:47,564
no one loves me like you do.

301
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:49,354
Why are you so sentimental?

302
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:50,966
I love you, babe.

303
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:55,665
- I love you, babe.
- I love you.

304
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:21,744
Hey, babe.

305
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:22,992
I missed you.

306
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:24,786
Hey, wait.

307
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,169
What's this?

308
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,813
Damn it!

309
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,298
That piece of shit!

310
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:36,304
I can't take it anymore.

311
00:38:38,305 --> 00:38:40,557
I’m like a prisoner,

312
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:43,326
strangled…

313
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:45,236
I can’t take it anymore.

314
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,482
So, leave him.

315
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,610
You have money in
the bank, don't you?

316
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:00,157
It's not that easy.

317
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:02,245
He'll have me killed.

318
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,855
Do you want me to handle this?

319
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:07,083
No.

320
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:08,246
Don't.

321
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,906
I don't want you to get hurt.

322
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:13,664
I've got a plan.

323
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:15,383
What are you thinking?

324
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:18,219
What if you get hurt?

325
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:21,139
Your husband is a monster.

326
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:24,971
He's my husband.

327
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:26,936
Just my husband.

328
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,522
It’s just a game.

329
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:33,902
It's all fake.

330
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:37,462
If you don’t beat him to it,

331
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:39,506
you'll end up dead on the street.

332
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,124
I want you to kill him.

333
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,417
Do it for me.

334
00:40:07,547 --> 00:40:08,793
I want you to kill him.

335
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:14,765
My husband is finally gone.

336
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,549
We are free now.

337
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:21,193
He agreed to leave you?

338
00:40:23,618 --> 00:40:25,453
I found a way.

339
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:29,925
Hey,

340
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,847
don't worry about it.

341
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,081
Didn't I tell you I have a plan?

342
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:39,450
What did you do?

343
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:49,511
We just need
to wait a little bit.

344
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:54,300
I'm having some papers arranged.

345
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:03,695
We'll be together again.

346
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,400
Just like before.

347
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,424
Adora?

348
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,413
Celia?

349
00:41:26,524 --> 00:41:27,882
Adora!

350
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,703
- What the—
- What the hell?

351
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:50,434
I'm still alive?

352
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:56,269
If you're looking
for Adora and Celia,

353
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,795
I had them stay at the neighbor's.

354
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,542
They won't be disturbing us.

355
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,261
Hi Vicky.

356
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,099
What?

357
00:42:10,186 --> 00:42:11,596
Are you surprised?

358
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:14,762
You must think I was in prison.

359
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:16,606
What the—

360
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,317
What happened?

361
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:21,397
Did you break out?

362
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:23,229
And you!

363
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:25,276
Relax, Vicky.

364
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,730
Listen closely, you bitch!

365
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,675
We had an agreement that
even if you didn't love me,

366
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:51,927
even if it's only for the money,

367
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:54,266
you wouldn’t turn on me.

368
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,375
But what did you do?

369
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,933
You think you're so smart.

370
00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:04,365
So you're Ted?

371
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:08,485
This will be worth your time.

372
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:10,910
Good. I'm a busy man.

373
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:11,935
What is this about?

374
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,917
Your wife wants you dead.

375
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:20,300
Can't you find a more original story
to con people with?

376
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:29,070
I want you to kill him.

377
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:30,179
Do it for me.

378
00:43:30,204 --> 00:43:31,661
Kill him!

379
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:37,765
He abuses me,
especially when we have sex,

380
00:43:39,272 --> 00:43:41,183
especially when I resist.

381
00:43:41,362 --> 00:43:44,247
His touch makes me vomit.

382
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:46,779
That bitch.

383
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,631
That bitch!

384
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,050
Hey man, calm down.

385
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:53,082
Calm down.

386
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:57,498
What are you doing this for?

387
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,209
I'm not a bad person.

388
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:02,754
I just want to help.

389
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,218
It hurts.

390
00:44:12,612 --> 00:44:14,364
It hurts so good.

391
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:25,516
Please sir! Don't!

392
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,213
Sir! I'm begging,

393
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:30,865
stop!

394
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:32,533
No!

395
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:34,042
Sir!

396
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:36,448
Please stop, Sir!

397
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:38,640
Enough.

398
00:44:38,665 --> 00:44:40,291
I'm begging!

399
00:44:43,503 --> 00:44:45,129
Please, Sir!

400
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:54,134
You didn’t even spare the maid!

401
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:58,304
You're lucky
I paid off the parents.

402
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:01,287
When are you going to shape up?

403
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,435
I heard you’ve been
skipping school, too!

404
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:08,731
If you don't stop this,

405
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:11,351
I’m cutting you off!

406
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:24,409
I’m sorry, Sir Arthur.

407
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:28,126
Your parents did not
survive the plane crash.

408
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,550
Please stop this.

409
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,052
Have mercy, Sir Arthur!

410
00:45:40,077 --> 00:45:42,792
Sir, please don’t do this!

411
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:46,097
Sir, please don’t!

412
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,410
Sir!

413
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:51,378
Sir!

414
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:55,361
- Sir!
- Hey, smile!

415
00:45:56,665 --> 00:45:59,501
Wow, you are so sexy.

416
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:00,956
Have a look.

417
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:03,511
You're sexy! Wow!

418
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:04,536
Sir!

419
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:17,742
No please, sir Arthur.

420
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,745
- Bring our powerbank.
- Okay, copy, sir.

421
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,276
- I might lose charge while we're out.
- Okay, sir.

422
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:58,053
- Get to it.
- Alright sir.

423
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,441
What else...

424
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:01,637
- My necklace too.
- Necklace?

425
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:02,972
- Alright, sir.
- Then, call the Colonel.

426
00:47:02,972 --> 00:47:04,307
- Colonel?
- Ask for updates.

427
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:05,349
Upda— Alright sir.

428
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:07,351
- Copy.
- Don't forget what I asked.

429
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:09,351
Alright, sir.

430
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:16,360
I'll talk to you later.

431
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:17,690
Thank you.

432
00:47:39,178 --> 00:47:40,400
Who was calling?

433
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,494
A client.

434
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,282
Thank you.

435
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,431
Thank you.

436
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,884
I love you.

437
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,598
I love you.

438
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:31,976
What kind of joke is this?

439
00:49:05,177 --> 00:49:06,177
Hello.

440
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:08,003
Hello.

441
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,295
When you go mountain climbing,

442
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,819
that's when she wants me to kill you.

443
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:26,824
Alright, thank you.

444
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:39,800
Take care.

445
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:12,967
Damn you!

446
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:16,182
How much did he pay you?

447
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:40,588
Arthur.

448
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,042
I still don't get why you're helping me.

449
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:10,185
That's her boyfriend.

450
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,865
They were together first.

451
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:14,554
But now that you’re married,

452
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:17,544
she just cheats on you with him.

453
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,646
That bitch.

454
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:22,061
That bitch.

455
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,275
How long have you
and your Vincent been playing me?

456
00:51:28,738 --> 00:51:30,248
You're siding with him?

457
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:32,904
He did it with me too!

458
00:51:35,694 --> 00:51:37,092
He did it--

459
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,381
That man of yours?

460
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:45,004
I’ll have him hunted down

461
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,756
by my personal guards.

462
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,718
Have mercy please.

463
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,428
Don't hurt Vincent.

464
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,498
Arthur, please.

465
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:02,563
I don't know what to do with him.

466
00:52:03,022 --> 00:52:04,311
But you,

467
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:06,751
my men will have
their way with you.

468
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:08,775
Then I’ll have you buried alive!

469
00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:13,949
You can go now.

470
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:15,336
I can take it from here.

471
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:17,014
I’ll write you a check.

472
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:20,790
I don't need your money.

473
00:52:20,998 --> 00:52:22,208
Thank you.

474
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:24,126
I'll find a way to repay you.

475
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:31,025
- What the?
- Hold on.

476
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,177
- What?
- We're not done yet.

477
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:41,227
Georgia.

478
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:42,828
Thank god you're here.

479
00:52:42,853 --> 00:52:43,979
Help me.

480
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:45,630
Please.

481
00:52:46,148 --> 00:52:47,817
We're friends, aren't we?

482
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,607
What's the meaning of this?

483
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,308
What was it you said?

484
00:52:59,348 --> 00:53:01,184
There are too many fools in the world.

485
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:05,624
Predators won't exist without their prey.

486
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:09,564
You were right.

487
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,092
You were both right.

488
00:54:47,085 --> 00:54:48,518
When will it happen?

489
00:54:49,747 --> 00:54:50,956
I don't know yet.

490
00:54:50,981 --> 00:54:53,108
It could be next month.

491
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:56,221
I understand.

492
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:59,573
You've always
wanted to join the army.

493
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:02,701
But why should it be Mindanao?

494
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,110
Don't worry.

495
00:55:05,346 --> 00:55:07,120
I'll contact you every day.

496
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:09,758
Even in the throes of battle and gunfire.

497
00:55:10,488 --> 00:55:11,875
You idiot.

498
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:23,095
I love you.

499
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:26,014
I love you, too.

500
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,407
- Get some rest.
- I can't take it anymore.

501
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:43,701
Mom is on her way.

502
00:55:43,935 --> 00:55:45,159
I'll be back.

503
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:51,542
Here.

504
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:53,502
Drink this.

505
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:55,127
You okay?

506
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:58,841
You okay?

507
00:56:00,672 --> 00:56:02,132
Mom, how did it go?

508
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:05,014
I've borrowed money from sir Arthur.
Gather all her things.

509
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,832
We're taking her to the hospital.

510
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:12,371
She needs a kidney transplant.

511
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,243
If she doesn't get one,
she could die.

512
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,658
Where will we get the money?

513
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:35,185
Hey don't go. Please.

514
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,338
We have to stop seeing each other.

515
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:38,625
Why?

516
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:42,009
I'm sorry.

517
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:47,321
But...

518
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,975
I can't worry about you and
my family at the same time.

519
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:56,397
I love you.

520
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:03,493
But I choose my family.

521
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:06,711
You don't have to choose.

522
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,274
I can help you.

523
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:14,957
Aren't you leaving?

524
00:57:16,618 --> 00:57:18,626
You don't have
to worry about me.

525
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,689
We can handle this.

526
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:21,860
Hey, what's wrong with you?

527
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:24,318
I won't leave then.
I won't go through with it.

528
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:27,137
- I'm not going.
- Don't.

529
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,673
You have to go.

530
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,350
I can't leave you.

531
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:35,571
- We're breaking up.
- No.

532
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:37,289
We'll do this together.

533
00:57:37,314 --> 00:57:39,549
- I'll help you.
- No.

534
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:44,148
Georgia! Please!

535
00:57:48,242 --> 00:57:51,161
When my father was still alive,
he worked as your driver,

536
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,821
so my mother would
come to you for help.

537
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,851
Double check the tires and gas.

538
00:57:57,876 --> 00:57:59,360
- We might need-
- Excuse me.

539
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:00,979
Sir Arthur?

540
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,272
Sonya, what happened?

541
00:58:02,297 --> 00:58:04,049
- Come in.
- Can I have a moment?

542
00:58:04,074 --> 00:58:05,539
Of course, come in.

543
00:58:06,385 --> 00:58:07,930
What happened to you?

544
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:12,507
Sir, I'm really sorry for this.

545
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:16,196
I just really need your help.

546
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:19,479
My daughter is in the hospital.

547
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,026
She might die.

548
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:27,197
There's no one else we
can come to, except you.

549
00:58:27,865 --> 00:58:29,450
I just really need your help.

550
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:32,555
I don't have anyone else to turn to.

551
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:34,333
I'm so ashamed but—

552
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:36,109
Don't worry. I'll help you.

553
00:58:36,457 --> 00:58:37,791
I'll help you.

554
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:39,668
- Really?
- Yes.

555
00:58:39,693 --> 00:58:40,769
Thank you.

556
00:58:40,794 --> 00:58:42,588
Thank you so much.

557
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,815
Thank you so much, sir Arthur.

558
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,633
Thank you so much.

559
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:58,930
But one night,

560
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:01,500
she came to you for help

561
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:05,776
and never came back.

562
00:59:13,156 --> 00:59:15,698
Mom got run over
on her way home.

563
00:59:16,905 --> 00:59:19,658
She was gone by the time
she arrived at the hospital.

564
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:25,394
She was carrying the money
she borrowed from you.

565
00:59:42,386 --> 00:59:44,105
Mom!

566
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:55,165
My life started to fall apart.

567
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,828
Even my sister was not spared.

568
01:00:00,258 --> 01:00:03,500
Even Ted disappeared on me.

569
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:06,521
I don't know if he even
made it to Mindanao.

570
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:11,077
Georgia.

571
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:18,976
Our condolences.

572
01:00:25,891 --> 01:00:28,868
- Thank you.
- Our condolences.

573
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,845
Do you need help finding work?
What was your major in college?

574
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:35,945
Accountancy, sir.

575
01:00:36,605 --> 01:00:38,326
Why don't you come work for us?

576
01:00:39,557 --> 01:00:41,714
I started working for you.

577
01:00:42,499 --> 01:00:45,127
I put my trust in what
I thought was your kindness.

578
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,175
But you turned out to be monsters!

579
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,191
Forgive me. I was just drunk.

580
01:01:52,436 --> 01:01:54,605
But I'll take care of you.

581
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,446
It won't happen again.

582
01:01:58,767 --> 01:01:59,853
I'm going to shower.

583
01:02:58,663 --> 01:03:02,882
The subscriber cannot be reached.
Please try again later.

584
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:56,351
I know how you feel right now.

585
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:58,917
But what can you do?

586
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:04,657
If you report my husband,
nothing will come of it.

587
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:11,147
Your husband is a monster.

588
01:04:16,537 --> 01:04:17,854
I know.

589
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,283
No! Please stop!

590
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:24,570
It's not just you.

591
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,556
There are many others.

592
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:34,190
Look, it vibrates.

593
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,517
He wants you to resist.

594
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:18,428
My husband is demented.

595
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:23,679
He enjoys recording all of his perversions.

596
01:05:23,915 --> 01:05:25,906
So that when he's alone,

597
01:05:26,616 --> 01:05:28,324
he can relive them.

598
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:14,473
But I guarantee you

599
01:07:15,393 --> 01:07:19,187
that he'll never do it again.

600
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:24,279
He doesn't repeat what
he does to other girls,

601
01:07:24,304 --> 01:07:25,942
except to me.

602
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:29,684
Because he loves me.

603
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:36,577
What kind of love is that?

604
01:07:39,113 --> 01:07:40,839
How can you stand it?

605
01:07:42,723 --> 01:07:45,336
I want to escape his grasp too.

606
01:07:50,656 --> 01:07:54,827
If you only knew
how long I’ve suffered.

607
01:07:57,534 --> 01:07:59,977
I have just been waiting
for the right moment.

608
01:08:00,353 --> 01:08:03,148
Learn to fight back, Georgia.

609
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:06,149
You and I will fight back.

610
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:11,100
It's all a game.

611
01:08:12,295 --> 01:08:14,601
If you don't beat them to it,

612
01:08:14,984 --> 01:08:17,528
you’ll end up dead.

613
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,131
We're in this together.

614
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:34,469
I am your friend.

615
01:08:35,964 --> 01:08:38,300
We are both women.

616
01:08:53,948 --> 01:08:54,948
Sir?

617
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:56,900
I need your signature.

618
01:08:58,545 --> 01:08:59,706
Hold on.

619
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,267
Hello.

620
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,526
Alright. Thank you.

621
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:29,692
Sign here, Sir.

622
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:38,151
Thank you, Sir.

623
01:09:57,139 --> 01:09:59,934
I know about all your
illegal transactions,

624
01:10:00,642 --> 01:10:03,478
all the corruption you engage in.

625
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,847
I hope this helps.

626
01:10:59,282 --> 01:11:01,718
Thank you, Sir Arthur.

627
01:11:01,743 --> 01:11:04,417
Thank you, Sir.
I should get going.

628
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:26,880
Please stop!

629
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:42,736
She was never in an accident.

630
01:12:43,678 --> 01:12:46,628
She killed herself
because you defiled her.

631
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:16,002
Ted?

632
01:13:19,547 --> 01:13:20,923
Ted!

633
01:13:25,345 --> 01:13:27,138
Ted!

634
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:48,938
We were stationed in Mindanao.

635
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,538
But everything went to shit.

636
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,706
My commanding officer
pushed me around.

637
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:06,719
So I fought back.

638
01:14:09,555 --> 01:14:11,224
I got dismissed.

639
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:18,106
From then on

640
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:21,273
my life started falling apart.

641
01:14:26,434 --> 01:14:29,156
Desperation led me to dark places.

642
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:36,554
I got hired by this mayor.

643
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:45,703
I learned to do evil.

644
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,065
I learned to kill.

645
01:15:01,477 --> 01:15:03,799
I couldn't think of
anyone else but you.

646
01:15:08,906 --> 01:15:10,531
You’re the only one I ever loved.

647
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:18,417
I know you've been calling me.

648
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:23,413
But...

649
01:15:25,548 --> 01:15:27,756
I'm no longer right for you.

650
01:17:11,907 --> 01:17:13,404
What’s on your mind?

651
01:17:14,913 --> 01:17:18,493
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

652
01:17:22,873 --> 01:17:26,667
Can we turn things back
to what they were before?

653
01:17:29,172 --> 01:17:30,630
Or not?

654
01:17:36,835 --> 01:17:38,679
What do you mean?

655
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:42,308
Forgive me, Ted.

656
01:17:44,353 --> 01:17:46,395
I don't think I can love anymore.

657
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:52,443
After everything I've been through,

658
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,989
there’s only one thing I want.

659
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:05,164
Revenge.

660
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:12,483
I will kill him.

661
01:18:13,758 --> 01:18:15,007
Both of them.

662
01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:18,886
They're both monsters.

663
01:18:21,474 --> 01:18:22,737
I thought

664
01:18:23,184 --> 01:18:25,144
Ma’am Vicky was my friend.

665
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:29,482
But they are the same.

666
01:18:31,942 --> 01:18:34,985
Why can't you let me leave you?

667
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:37,919
What do you want from me?

668
01:18:40,117 --> 01:18:42,787
Why do you want to leave?
Because you have money now?

669
01:18:43,371 --> 01:18:44,371
Huh?

670
01:18:45,723 --> 01:18:47,433
I've told you a thousand times.

671
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,374
I’ll only let you go

672
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,085
when you're dead.

673
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:55,216
I can't take any more of your depravity.

674
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:58,344
You’re not a saint either.

675
01:18:58,599 --> 01:19:01,310
You love what you do for me.

676
01:19:02,053 --> 01:19:05,390
- Please don't do this!
- She's just as insane as her husband.

677
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:08,560
It's usually her
who's taking the videos.

678
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,174
No, please!

679
01:19:10,616 --> 01:19:13,284
Please stop this!

680
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,257
Please, no more!

681
01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:21,635
Please, stop!

682
01:19:30,882 --> 01:19:33,159
Please, enough!

683
01:19:43,753 --> 01:19:46,798
Please, no more!

684
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,404
Don't you?

685
01:19:59,297 --> 01:20:04,384
I know she took the videos of him
raping me and my mom.

686
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,538
You heartless bastards!

687
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:13,502
You soulless monsters.

688
01:20:19,049 --> 01:20:20,676
I will have my revenge.

689
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:25,456
- I'm just waiting for my chance.
- Georgia.

690
01:20:25,895 --> 01:20:27,427
You are not a murderer.

691
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:30,476
Let me do this for you.

692
01:20:36,358 --> 01:20:37,610
I will avenge you.

693
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:43,984
Here.

694
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:47,170
You know what to do.

695
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:48,799
Thank you, boss.

696
01:20:48,829 --> 01:20:49,829
Go ahead.

697
01:21:12,728 --> 01:21:14,605
Help! Someone please—

698
01:22:07,616 --> 01:22:09,285
Hi, I'm Vicky.

699
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:13,855
Ted.

700
01:23:34,612 --> 01:23:36,987
Why are you spying on me?

701
01:23:39,342 --> 01:23:42,471
You attract too much attention.

702
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,211
Why do you care?

703
01:23:47,953 --> 01:23:49,449
If it were me,

704
01:23:49,721 --> 01:23:51,103
I would be more discreet.

705
01:23:56,396 --> 01:23:57,660
What do you want?

706
01:23:58,495 --> 01:23:59,830
You promised that

707
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:02,729
you'd help me
get revenge on Sir Arthur.

708
01:24:04,553 --> 01:24:05,996
You told me

709
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:08,898
that we were together in this.

710
01:24:11,154 --> 01:24:12,154
Fine.

711
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:17,089
But don’t even think
about betraying me.

712
01:24:17,962 --> 01:24:19,950
Because I can take you.

713
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:22,379
Yes, ma'am.

714
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:29,664
Help me find
a suitable house for Vincent.

715
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:45,236
Vicky wants Arthur dead.

716
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,780
That's her secret.

717
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:52,362
She wants to be with her man.

718
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:02,516
So?

719
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:04,418
Do we kill them now?

720
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,021
Georgia.

721
01:25:09,847 --> 01:25:14,685
Georgia, don't shoot me please.

722
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:17,596
Aren't I your friend?

723
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,429
I was with you through it all.

724
01:25:20,676 --> 01:25:22,845
You and your husband are no different!

725
01:25:30,183 --> 01:25:31,183
Take it!

726
01:25:31,737 --> 01:25:32,737
Shoot her.

727
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:34,782
Shoot her!

728
01:25:37,119 --> 01:25:38,324
Kill her.

729
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:40,850
I said, kill her!

730
01:25:42,465 --> 01:25:43,981
Arthur!

731
01:25:51,006 --> 01:25:52,132
What now?

732
01:25:52,549 --> 01:25:53,823
Can't you do it?

733
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:55,928
But she'd happily have you killed!

734
01:25:55,928 --> 01:25:57,262
She was planning to leave you!

735
01:25:57,262 --> 01:25:59,139
She was going to
leave with her man!

736
01:25:59,164 --> 01:26:00,165
Do it!

737
01:26:00,408 --> 01:26:01,326
Damn you all!

738
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:02,686
You can't win.

739
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:04,982
Get your gun out of my face,
or I’ll blow her brains out.

740
01:26:28,054 --> 01:26:29,221
Let him go!

741
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:30,629
I'll kill her!

742
01:26:43,402 --> 01:26:45,196
Both of you go to hell!

743
01:26:45,305 --> 01:26:47,015
You're both monsters!

744
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:48,403
Go there!

745
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:49,973
Over there!
