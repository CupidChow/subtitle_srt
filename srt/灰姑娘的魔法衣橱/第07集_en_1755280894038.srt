1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
To be continued

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,340
His concert start

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,800
So you'reè›‡!

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,280
Kurotaki-san, your phone is ringing...

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,880
It's not that easy.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,160
Take care of yourself.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,900
Because next weekend's big sing farming festival.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,160
It'd be a one month anniversary.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,780
It's my imagination...

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,500
See?We've just started.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
You're the one.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm home.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Hey, did something happen?

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Haruka.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
You know...

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I...

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I broke up with Mr. Kurotaki.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
You broke up a month ago, right?

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Yeah.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
What do you mean?

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
You know...

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I can only ask you to listen to me.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Thank you.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Mr. Kurotaki,

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
what did you like about me?

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
You're cute and thoughtful.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
You're a good girl.

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
You're a good girl no matter what.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I don't know Haruka's ring size, so I thought we could buy it together.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
It's called an anniversary ring.

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
So how do you break up with him?

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
He's doing a lot for Haruka.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
That's why.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
What?

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I've been upset since the day I met Miurin.

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
You're a friend?

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Or a classmate?

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
It's not like I'm hiding it.

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
She was my ex-girlfriend.

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Your ex-girlfriend?

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I thought you and I were cute influencers like Miurin.

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
I thought we were in love.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I felt so inferior.

45
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Haruka, I'm sorry.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I'll talk to you later.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
It's too late.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
You should tell me what's important.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I've never seen you like that.

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I thought you were a man of my age.

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
You looked like you were having fun.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
No, I've known you for a long time.

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
No.

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
No?

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I've been jealous lately.

56
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
I've been feeling down.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I've been feeling bad.

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You were really scared of stalkers.

59
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,500
If I stay like this, I'll hate myself.

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Let's go.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Haruka.

63
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Can I talk to you?

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Yes.

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Haruka.

67
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
What's wrong?

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Please leave me.

69
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
What?

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
It's hard to be with you.

72
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
It's hard to be with you.

73
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
I see.

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I understand.

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
So easily?

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Yes.

78
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I don't think you know it.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
But I think you like me.

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Why do you think so?

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:40,500
You never look back after you say goodbye.

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You say you want me.

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,500
But you're not that kind of person.

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
You've been thinking about me since we broke up.

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
No.

86
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Haruka, that's...

87
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Don't worry.

88
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
I said I wanted to break up with you.

89
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I think I just wanted to be in love.

90
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,500
I didn't want to see anything fun.

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I was a light person.

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Why do you say that?

93
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I'll get mad.

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I'll get mad.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll get mad.

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
I mean...

97
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,500
If you really love me, do your best.

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I've been supporting you.

99
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,500
But you let go so easily.

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I saw that you really loved him.

101
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I saw that.

102
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,500
You're too sweet to me.

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
It's okay.

104
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It's okay.

105
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Even if you hate yourself,

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I love you.

107
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
It's okay.

108
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I wanted to be cool.

109
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I wanted to be cool.

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I wanted to be cool.

111
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Hikaru was by my side until the morning.

112
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Thank you so much for hvad you meant.

113
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
My bang's a little short.

114
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
The same, right?

115
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Then who's this?

116
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Another guy.

117
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
And this guy?

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
I know what you're trying to do, but...

119
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
You still haven't found a model?

120
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
You think you can make it?

121
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
It's okay. I'll find one for sure.

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,500
I see. So it's for Hikaru.

123
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I'm the only one who understands Hikaru's world view.

124
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
You're a help. Thank you.

125
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,500
You're welcome. I'll do anything I can.

126
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Let's do this together.

127
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Okay.

128
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
I've been waiting for you.

129
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I've been waiting for you.

130
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,500
This is my first date in my life.

131
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm glad you've been thinking about me.

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I want you to know more about yourself.

133
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I'll do my best.

134
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Hikaru

135
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Hello?

136
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Are you okay?

137
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Why are you so quiet?

138
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Hikaru!

139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I thought you'd cut your hair if you were in a relationship.

140
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
You're so stubborn.

141
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
What's with the hair?

142
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I knew it.

143
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Why do you want to cut it?

144
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
There are people who can rely on you.

145
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I'll cut Haruka's hair.

146
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I was busy preparing for the show.

148
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I'll be done soon.

149
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
It's my fault.

151
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
It's a day off. Don't worry.

152
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I just came to see Hikaru's cut.

153
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Did you cut your hair?

154
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Why?

155
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Really?

156
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Did you cut your hair?

157
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Really? It hurts.

158
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
No.

160
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Hikaru is popular.

161
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Everyone is so good at it.

162
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Hikaru won the contest last year.

163
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Really?

164
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Only the best students can do the hair and makeup.

165
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
And Hikaru was eliminated.

166
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Hikaru is amazing.

167
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Why are you so proud?

168
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Because I know Hikaru the best.

169
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I know.

170
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm in the way.

171
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I know.

172
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm in the way.

173
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I know.

174
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Thank you for waiting.

175
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Thank you.

176
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm sorry for calling you.

177
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I was surprised.

178
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
But you broke up with Haruka.

179
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Really?

180
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Mio gave me advice.

181
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
I did it again.

182
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I can't believe it.

183
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
I can't believe it.

184
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I thought you weren't me.

185
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I understand.

186
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Leave it to me.

187
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
What?

188
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It's a reflection.

189
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
It's meaningless to go to the next one.

190
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm counting on you.

192
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
First, I'll take Keisuke's hair.

193
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
All of a sudden?

194
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I'll take it all in 10 minutes.

195
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm sorry it's cold.

196
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Thank you for being busy.

197
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm sorry it's cold.

198
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Thank you for being busy.

199
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm done.

200
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm glad you cut it.

201
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I feel like a new me.

202
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
You look good with a short neck.

203
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You're good at watching.

204
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
You too.

205
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I'm sorry to bother you.

206
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Thank you.

207
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Hikaru.

208
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I was here.

209
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Model.

210
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Model?

211
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I look like Haruka.

212
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
What?

213
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Haruka is...

214
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Haruka, can you be our model?

215
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
We're going to be like Emel Jones.

216
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
A normal girl with clothes and hair.

217
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,500
A concept that shines like a stranger.

218
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Look.

219
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Don't you think it's a good image when you're short?

220
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
This is the venue.

221
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Wow, it's really nice.

222
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Wait a minute.

223
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Are you saying this is bad?

224
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Well...

225
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
No, no, no, no.

226
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
No matter what you think, it's impossible.

227
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I can't do it here.

228
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Haruka.

229
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
It's okay.

230
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I know.

231
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I won't let Haruka do anything bad.

232
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Don't worry.

233
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Hikaru, I'm not saying I don't like it.

234
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
There you are.

235
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Hikaru, can I talk to you?

236
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm coming.

237
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I couldn't help you.

240
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Haruka.

241
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
This award is very important.

242
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
What?

243
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,500
The results of the award also affect the harvest.

244
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,500
That means Hikaru's future.

245
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
When I saw the drawing of Hikaru's face,

246
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I thought Hikaru was perfect for Haruka.

247
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
You know Hikaru very well.

248
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Well, we've been together for a long time.

249
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
We?

250
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm sorry to stop you.

251
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I have the award, so don't worry.

252
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I'll find a good model for Hikaru.

253
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Take care.

254
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Bye.

255
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Hikaru.

256
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Sorry, I just finished.

257
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I'll send you to the entrance.

258
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Thanks for coming.

259
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Take care.

260
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Hey.

261
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
What do you think of Hikaru?

262
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Do you want me to be your model?

263
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
No.

264
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I said I couldn't do it.

265
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,500
If I said I'd do it, would you be happy?

266
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
No, that's...

267
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,500
The End

268
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Hikaru, do you know him?

269
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Hikaru?

270
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
You're still dressed like this.

271
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
You're a shame.

272
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I won't forgive anyone who hurts Hikaru.

273
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I want you to be Haruka's model.

274
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I'll do my best.

275
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I'll do it instead of you.

276
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
No, I'm the one who's going to make Haruka.

277
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm not going to be a man who gets hit.
