Episode 2

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Shall we date, Haruka?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Y-Yes, please!

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll never forget that we gave each other presents.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
When we put this on, it's like Hikaru is with me.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The pancake shop we went to the other day was really good.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I want Haruka to try it too.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What's the secret to its deliciousness?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is it the whip?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Or the dough?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is this a gift for me?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're going to kiss him with this?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Haruka.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Close your eyes.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It fell.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry!

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you for sending me this.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Of course, it's because you're his girlfriend.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
See you tomorrow.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, see you tomorrow!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is my girlfriend!

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Mr. Grotak is really kind.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's so mature and nice to me.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He's so mature, but he's so mature.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I guess it's because of the difference in experience.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's better than being tired of being too active.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hikaru!

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm glad it went well.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is this weekend free?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I want to go to an event that Hikaru would like.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you're with him, it's fine.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Really?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, I'll ask Mr. Grotak.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll call you again.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, see you.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Grotak said he could go too.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm looking forward to playing with Hikaru after a long time.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm looking forward to playing with Hikaru after a long time.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's it.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please come on out.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is Mio from Yoke Influencer.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hello, I'm Mio Rin.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's so cool!

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you so much for coming.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Mr. Grotak just arrived.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where is it?

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The girl in the orange cardigan.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Me?

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes, come here.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But...

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, go ahead.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hikaru...

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't take the chance.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why did you invite me today?

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't like to be alone with a girl who has a boyfriend.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You don't have to worry about it.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Make-up and Hikaru are more fun together.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't believe it.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you serious?

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Are you kidding me?

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Kidding?

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I trust you two.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Trust?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hikaru...

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I told you not to take the chance.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I like Haruka.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I really like her.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mr. Grotak!

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Not at all.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not at all.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You look perfect today.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I got it done at the event.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Really?

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It looks good on you.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really?

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Keisuke?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mio?

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you know the influencer?

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't know her.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She's a high school classmate.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know her.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She's my ex-girlfriend.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What?

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ex-girlfriend?

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ex-girlfriend?

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come in.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Keisuke, it's been a while.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was surprised.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's been a while.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm so happy you came to the event.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well...

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm here with my girlfriend.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Girlfriend?

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't worry about it.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't mean to be mean.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just wanted to apologize.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I broke up with Tenko Ryu.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're kidding, right?

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Huh?

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is me when I was in high school.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was ugly and handsome.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But you're handsome and popular.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I didn't have the confidence to be next to you.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the real reason.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I started this kind of activity because I wanted to change.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to give courage to a girl like me.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Thank you for the opportunity.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, I...

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry for everything.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm making a lot of fun of you.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Did you know?

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've started to watch it recently.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're amazing, Keisuke.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're so pretty.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What?

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're beautiful.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I envy you.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This way.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm so sorry.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I'm sorry for what I did.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't worry.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know you're beautiful and you misunderstand me.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry for saying that.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're good at makeup.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're always amazing.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Huh?

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Keisuke.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Keisuke.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What are you saying to a girl?

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't think they meant that.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm a man.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm good at makeup.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What?

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're a man?

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't know you were a man.

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You were called Hikaru.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you a comedian?

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, I'm not.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What a shame.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you have a crush?

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you want to date?

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Huh?

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I like you.

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hikaru, will you go out with me?

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're a fan of my channel.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can do it.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so excited.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want to.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's business.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're so cold.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then, let's get out of business.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going out with you.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I have a crush.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have a crush?

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's going to be complicated.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Be quiet.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you're not going out with me now?

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have a chance to date me.

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know about the rest.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I only date people I really like.

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I like you.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I decided.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll go out with you.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You've changed.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're so beautiful.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's about your character.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You look different.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I look different.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You look different.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Really?

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
See you.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mr. Kurotaki.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well...

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Are you free next weekend?

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm going to visit you.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He left.

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What should I do?

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to be attracted to him.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What?

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have a part-time job until evening.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Can I go after that?

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I want to eat your food.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you have a request?

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Fried chicken.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Leave it to me.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What's going on?

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Idiot.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You were worried about Mio.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You were worried about her.

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's a big mistake to be relieved when it's a relationship between men and women.

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't be so sure.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't sleep.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're worried about her.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll make her say she's good.

216
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She's not a bad person.

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Her house is a home.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
She's a real man.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's not your fault.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You should have said you couldn't do it.

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not confident.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a home to be caught by a man's stomach.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I've never been able to cook.

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Move your hands if you know.

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes.

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is this okay?

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's hot.

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What are you doing?

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If you get burned, you'll get cold.

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hikaru.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you for everything.

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's wrong with you?

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm the only one who's getting help.

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What kind of person is Hikaru's favorite?

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I won't say.

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't want to make it happen.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I know you're messing with me.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you laugh, that's fine.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sure Haruka heard you.

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm jealous of you.

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're my friend.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Jealous?

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm jealous.

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's burning.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What should I do?

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's delicious.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's delicious.

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's fun to make it alone.

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't think I can do it alone.

251
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's okay.

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You want to marry someone.

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You want to have the ability.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's fun to be with someone.

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want to marry someone like Hikaru.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What kind of dress do you want to wear?

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Stop it.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm a man.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can wear a taxi.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I see.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I know.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll get you some tea.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why did I think of this?

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hello.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm going to work now.

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you.

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Please come slowly.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Perfect.

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How did it go with your senior?

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was invited to a new house.

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was invited to a new house.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Did you like it?

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's great.

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Please come in.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you for waiting.

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm tired from work.

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm so happy.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I want to eat fried food.

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Please wait.

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll take a shower.

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sweating.

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please come in.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This way.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The towel.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The towel is in the drawer.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Thank you.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please come in.

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
My heart is beating fast.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mr. Kurotaki.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The phone is ringing.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Really?

296
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Take it.

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Please come in.

298
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you.

299
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you.

300
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hikaru, what's wrong?

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He was there.

302
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Isn't he with you?

303
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He went out because he had a break.

304
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

305
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Anyway, I'm fine.

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Thank you.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No.

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hikaru?

309
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Ryo!

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Keisuke.

311
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What happened?

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The phone...

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's ringing.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Celesta Building.

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll be right there.

318
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Haruka, I'm sorry.

319
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll talk to you later.

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What?

321
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What is he thinking?

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He can't just leave her alone.

323
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But something must have happened.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So I can't help it.

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's easy to be patient.

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But that means you're running away.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you don't, you'll be left alone forever.

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's okay.

330
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hikaru is with you.

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay.

332
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank you.

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's look over there.

334
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Where is it?

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to be treated like a good girlfriend.

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't want to be treated like a good girlfriend.

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm not going to lie to you.

338
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll never call you again.

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's our one-month anniversary.

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's like a date at a hotel.

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
A hotel?

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What did you like about me?
