Episode 3

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Call me.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Celesta building. I'll be right there.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Haruka, I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mio!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Keisuke-kun.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, man.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Haruka?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I...

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not going.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's with you?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you going to just let it be?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I mean...

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be thought of as a good girlfriend by Mr. Furotaki.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You idiot.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're Haruka.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A good girl's bro is 100 years too early.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're not going to.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You have to listen to the rules. You can't go on like this.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Fine. I'm going.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I...

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I regret...

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
about when I was in high school.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wait.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I forgot my phone.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sorry.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Huh?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Suzuki-san?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Huh?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Huh?

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Kurotaki-kun.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You knew my name?

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Huh?

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're Suzuki Mio, right?

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know you're from the same class.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're normal.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, but we've never talked properly before.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Kurotaki, are you still here?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sorry. I'll talk to you later.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're not going to class?

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not the type Kurotaki-kun and the others are.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go together after this.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to talk more with Mio.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When we first talked, I thought you were a good girl.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Please go out with me.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was happy to be confessed.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I thought we were going well together.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But when I went to school during summer vacation...

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I didn't understand what you meant.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But when I heard about the video...

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a bad thing, but you're handsome and popular.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I didn't have the confidence to be next to you.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the real reason.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're angry because I made it up, right?

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm angry at myself.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm angry at myself.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was with you, but I didn't notice anything.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm tired of my insincerity.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I didn't think you would care about me like that.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I wish we could talk more like this.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's look for her.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where is she?

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey!

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you okay?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm fine.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Haruka?

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You promised Haruka today.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What do you mean?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stalker?

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know yet.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But I'm scared of people following me all day.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll go get some water.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I just moved to Tokyo, and I only relied on you.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I was so worried that someone else would come.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm glad you're okay.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry I bothered you.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's too late.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You should talk to me.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Haruka, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can take you home.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Of course.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll send her home.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's okay.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sure she'll be more relieved.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you sure?

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Please be careful.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry for the sweat.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can I take you home with me?

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But I'm worried.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's hard being an influencer.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you for today.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll see you around.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll send her home.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm fine.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm hungry.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wait.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It looks delicious.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Can I eat?

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll warm it up.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's delicious.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Really?

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's delicious.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's too good.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It was better when it was freshly fried.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's delicious even when it's cold.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's delicious.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've never seen you like that.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Haruka, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Haruka, I'm really sorry.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll talk to you later.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You shouldn't be.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You'll make me worried.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's okay.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I won't sit down.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm relieved.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Right?

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hikaru is here for me.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's delicious.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Of course.

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Who taught you that?

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hikaru taught me.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you know, eat it all.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll eat it.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll eat it.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll eat it.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll eat it.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll eat it.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll eat it.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll eat it.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll eat it.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll eat it.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll eat it.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll eat it.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Eat cabbage.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Vitamin is important.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're early, Kurotaki.

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry about the other day.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's okay.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll open next week.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a month anniversary.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think girls are important.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You remember me?

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm happy.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You didn't go out because of work.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So think about the course.

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's wrong?

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nothing.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll call you when I get closer.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll go now.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll go now.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was arrested.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is for you two.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you for the other day.

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry to make you worry.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I wasn't angry enough.

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I'm sorry.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I won't contact you again.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't worry.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Are you trying to say that?

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm really sorry.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But you don't have a manager.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's why you contacted me.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's...

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
When things get difficult, trust me.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't hold anything to yourself.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think so too.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Haruka.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll go get some water.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Thank you.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You idiot.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why are you worrying about me in front of Haruka?

202
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm just worried about you.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're the same, Keisuke.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're nice to everyone.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But I'm worried about her.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're not like your usual self.

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I know.

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll be careful from now on.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Haruka is a good girl.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I want her to be happy.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Take good care of her.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I know you won't say it.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Really?

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I won't hurt Haruka.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I promise.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Please.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How much I love her.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If only I could tell.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hikaru, I'm so happy.

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was worried you'd be busy.

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I couldn't call you.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I knew it.

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm fine. I'm on break.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're going to be a month with Kurotaki.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You were worried about me?

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I thought about the anniversary.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's good.

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe a night out date.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Night out?

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A kiss before a night out.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What are you thinking?

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're saying weird things.

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm just having fun.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Sorry.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll call you later.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I didn't know Hikaru was going to school.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why are we here?

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was asked to teach at the influencer course.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to be a judge this year.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What?

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is called destiny.

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Shu?

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Haruka.

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Long time no see.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Are you going home?

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes. I'm going to work now.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I see.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You heard about the show, right?

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is how it's going to be this year.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I see.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I like it.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hikaru, come with me.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Come with me.

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Good luck.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
See you.

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,260
Hikaru's

262
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hikaru.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's almost the month anniversary.

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Have you decided what to wear?

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Welcome.

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're so busy. Are you sure you're okay?

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

268
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm going to change my mind.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What do you think of this dress?

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you have one?

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Which one should I choose?

274
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Something's been wrong.

275
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you have any questions, just ask me.

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm fine.

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm fine.

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I heard from Shu.

279
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Myo-rin is the judge.

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, right.

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was so surprised by the coincidence.

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I see.

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Which one do you think is better?

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You're good at it.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This one?

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Then I'll choose this one.

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Haruka.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't worry.

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I like you.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Excuse me.

292
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'd like one of these.

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I know this store.

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I saw it on Instagram.

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's fashionable, delicious, and very popular.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm glad you're happy.

297
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're a girl's favorite.

298
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's for her.

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What is it?

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I have something to apologize for.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I overheard your conversation with Ms. Kurotaki at the cafe.

302
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sorry, too.

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was angry at her for not taking good care of Haruka.

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I feel like I'm doing too much.

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I thought you were a good match.

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think so.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Ms. Kurotaki when she was talking to Miorin,

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I feel like an old man.

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Really?

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I like her mature and cool side.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
She's actually a very cute person.

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not happy to be called cute.

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Really?

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What did you like about me?

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
She's cute and thoughtful.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I think she's a good girl.

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What is this place?

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know the size of Haruka's finger.

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I wanted to buy it with her.

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's an anniversary ring.

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think I've been thinking about it since I started thinking about it.

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I know, but I can't imagine it.

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What?

325
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Don't be so rude.

327
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Haruka.

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Kuro?

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What's wrong?

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You have class, right?

331
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's her.

332
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Where is she?

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
She's already gone.

334
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey, did something happen?

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Haruka.

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You know what?

337
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I broke up with Kurotaki.

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Please break up with me.

339
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Even if Haruka hates herself, she likes Haruka.

340
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If you say you're sorry, I'll cut your hair.

341
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Haruka, you're the model for Hikaru's group.

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're the model for Hikaru's group.

343
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm not a model.

344
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm not a model.

345
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Haruka, can you be the model for Hikaru's group?

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Leave it to me.

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The shame of the Kamiyama family.
