1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
To be continued...

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,160
When I was admiring Tokyo, I was much more like a girl.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,540
Sorry!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,800
How do you do your long eyelashes?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,600
What do you do with your skin like a rabbit?

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,300
You wanted to be cute for the person you like, didn't you?

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm not confident.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,980
I'll cast a spell.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,600
You're so confident that you can't even say a word.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,780
You're amazing.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,940
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Kurotaki.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,740
I'll go on a date with you next time.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,860
Yes.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,580
Can you tell me about Hikaru's magic?

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,080
He's not as kind as the one who was just a kid.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hikaru!

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,380
Stop being such a man and be mine.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,800
Hikaru's man? What do you mean?

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Oh.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,720
This is what I mean.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
A girl?

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,640
Why?

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,680
I like beautiful things, so I wear what I want to wear.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,900
I see.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,820
What?

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
What do you mean?

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,820
Are you saying that we...

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,280
We're a man and a woman, and we're in first place?

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,500
What are you doing?

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,080
You were so aggressive.

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,500
What did I do?

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,540
I don't know.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,380
There's only one thing you can do.

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,720
What?

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,020
Trying to findØ±

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,440
A few days earlier

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Is it about the baby?

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,540
I'm glad, but...

40
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,920
What's this?

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,640
Over there!

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,180
You're parking over there in this teachers' Volvo mansion.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,320
She's not coming out?

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Drunkard...

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,320
I can tell I'm drinking water.

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,060
Don't step out.

47
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,860
Treat this like something new.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,920
Fl ahora, on the track.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,620
panties.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
It's so hot!

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,340
I didn't clean up, but my fingers are all dirty.

55
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
I guess this is enough.

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Good night.

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm so exhausted.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm so tired.

59
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm so tired.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm so tired.

61
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm so tired.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
I'm so tired.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm so tired.

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm so tired.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm so tired.

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
I'm so tired.

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
I'm so tired.

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
You're done?

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Good job.

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I'm going to bed.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
You're not wearing a dress today.

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
You were cute.

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
What?

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
You're not coming to work.

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
What?

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Haruka, you're wearing too many clothes.

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm confident in my health,

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
but thank you.

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll be careful.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
We're on a break.

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Tomorrow?

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Are you going somewhere tomorrow?

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
What?

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Are you going to Sasagani-kyu tomorrow?

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
No, I'm happy.

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Then it's a deal.

87
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
I'll call you when I have time.

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Okay.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
Thank you.

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
That's good.

91
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
It's not good.

92
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,400
What should I do?

93
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Let's go to a cafe.

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Mr. Piccoli!

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
What?

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Please tell me the magic you promised.

97
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
What I want to know is...

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,160
what clothes you're wearing.

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,760
You're so lame.

100
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
What?

101
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,280
You're wearing clothes

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,760
that even I can wear.

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
What do you want to know?

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Mr. Kurotaki.

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Then think about Kurotaki more.

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
I see.

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
But the budget is tight.

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,920
You're not wearing a dress today.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You were cute.

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,520
A dress?

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
A dress.

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
A dress.

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
A dress is enough for one.

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
You can live without having to pay.

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Is this it?

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Is there anything you're curious about?

117
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
No.

118
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
It's okay to decide on shoes.

119
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,280
But it's impossible.

120
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Why?

121
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I've always been a tall person.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
If I wear heels, I'll look like a giant.

123
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Cat!

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
You're too close to your neck.

125
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Don't be so angry.

126
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Pull your chin.

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Pull your chin.

128
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Don't hide it.

129
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Be bold.

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
What's wrong with being tall?

131
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
You've always been a good woman.

132
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Perfect.

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm glad you changed your clothes.

134
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
It's my first date, so I did my best.

135
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I'll give you a cabbage as a thank you.

136
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
That's enough.

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Don't bring it to me.

138
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
What's going on in your head?

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,720
You're a woman, so you should pull your chin.

140
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Why?

141
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Why?

142
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I want to be friends with you.

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm embarrassed.

144
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,720
I know you're a nice person.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
I'm not angry.

146
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
That's not what I meant.

147
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
I know.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's okay.

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
What?

150
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
You can call me Hikaru.

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
You'll be my friend.

152
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
We're the same age.

153
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
What?

154
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
We're the same age?

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Then we can call each other Tameguchi.

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
What?

157
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
You're really cool.

158
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Call me Haruka.

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Nice to meet you, Hikaru.

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay.

161
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
You're friends now.

162
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Do you have a crush on someone?

163
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
What?

164
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Hurry up.

165
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
I don't want to talk about it.

166
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Do you have a crush on someone?

167
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Are you curious?

168
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm not.

169
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
What?

170
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Wait!

171
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Don't worry.

172
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,280
I can't date a woman who's always fighting.

173
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
You saw that?

174
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Hello?

175
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Hello, Haruka?

176
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Are you okay?

177
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Yes, of course.

178
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Good.

179
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I was thinking about what to do tomorrow.

180
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
My friend invited me to a party

181
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,760
for the new selection.

182
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Are you interested?

183
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
A party?

184
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
You have a great friend.

185
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Can I go too?

186
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Of course.

187
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
I'll go on a casual date.

188
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Of course.

189
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,880
It's a casual party, so I'll be fine.

190
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I'm a little nervous about a party.

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
But I want to go.

192
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Okay.

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
It's decided then.

194
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Yes.

195
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I'm looking forward to it.

196
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay.

197
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Bye.

198
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
She's so serious.

199
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,760
A date with that face.

200
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
But I've done it many times.

201
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
And this?

202
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Anyway, drop everything.

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Yes, sir!

204
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
I'm done.

205
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Wow!

206
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I can go on a date with Mr. Kurotaki.

207
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
You can?

208
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Why?

209
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Because...

210
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Who do you think chose that makeup and clothes?

211
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,040
You think you're not confident after this?

212
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
That's not what I meant!

213
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,640
Don't bring up a relationship between a man and a woman.

215
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,280
You'll be licked if you're a tiktok.

216
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Mr. Kurotaki won't do that.

217
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Then don't be so hard on him.

218
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
He's the cutest guy I've ever seen.

219
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Mr. Kurotaki!

220
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Wow, you're so cute!

221
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
That's great.

222
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Let's go.

223
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Okay!

224
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Haruka is the cutest girl I've ever seen.

225
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Thank you!

226
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Thank you so much!

227
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Thank you so much!

228
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Thank you so much!

229
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
I love you, Hikaru!

230
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll always rely on you no matter what happens!

231
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll always be there for you!

232
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I love you!

233
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Geez, they're just friends.

234
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Huh?

235
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Is that lipstick a new one from Gunelius?

236
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,640
What's with the attitude?

237
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,320
You know what I mean.

238
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I know everything about you.

239
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,480
I thought that color would suit you.

240
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Let's go.

241
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Let's go.

242
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
What?

243
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,880
It's a date, but it's so cold.

244
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I have to hurry or I'll be late.

245
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Oh, turn it off.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, this one too.

247
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,760
Oh, they're doing it.

248
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm here.

249
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,360
Excuse me.

250
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Hello.

251
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Wow.

252
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,160
Wow.

253
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Keisuke!

254
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,520
Wow, long time no see.

255
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
It's so cold.

256
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,120
We haven't seen each other since Tomoki's birthday.

257
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Right?

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
Long time no see.

259
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Honek!

260
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Long time no see.

261
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Great to see you.

262
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Yeah, so am I.

263
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,760
I didn't expect you to expand your marketing in Japan.

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,440
Thank you for accepting to be a model.

265
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,800
So you're here with your friend?

266
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Uh...

267
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm here with...

268
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
someone special.

269
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Awesome.

270
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
It's great to meet you.

271
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,840
I got to know Keisuke two years ago through his Ruby Kelly.

272
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,160
Well, I met Nick in a room-mate in a foreign school.

273
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
What?

274
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Yeah.

275
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Nick!

276
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,360
Can you hand the interview?

277
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm coming.

278
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Feel free to look around.

279
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Yeah, enjoy.

280
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Thank you.

281
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,000
He's really amazing.

282
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Cool.

283
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,840
I think you're amazing too, Mr. Kurotaki.

284
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn't understand what you were saying.

285
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,800
Oh, you came here with your friend?

286
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,720
What do you call your work partner in English?

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know.

288
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
What?

289
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,520
I said I came here with a girl I'm interested in.

290
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
What?

291
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,360
Are you okay?

292
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,360
I'm totally fine.

293
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,560
Is this your first time here?

294
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,480
If you tell me it's my first time, I'll be attracted.

295
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,080
It's been a while.

296
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Did you find out?

297
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
I see.

298
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,200
Do you like select shops?

299
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280
What? Yes, of course.

300
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm kidding. I've never been here before.

301
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,040
It looks delicious.

302
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Which one?

303
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,080
This one and this one.

304
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,280
It's amazing.

305
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Yeah.

306
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Oh, it's your house.

307
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, you like these kind of design?

308
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Yes.

309
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm kidding. I was just kidding.

310
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Kurotaki.

311
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Yes?

312
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
It's been a while.

313
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,160
Nick's shooting is in the background.

314
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Yes, it is.

315
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
Thank you for inviting me.

316
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,240
I heard Hikaru's voice.

317
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Hikaru!

318
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
What?

319
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
Why are you here?

320
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm here to listen to the sound of the same grade students.

321
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm here to listen to the sound of the same grade students.

322
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,240
I'm here to listen to the sound of the same grade students.

323
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm the son of the same grade student,

324
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,480
and this is Kiriya, his father's company.

325
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,040
What? Kiriya is a cosmetics brand?

326
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,480
I know her.

327
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Thank you.

328
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
I'm Kiriya Shu.

329
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,600
Well...

330
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
What's your name?

331
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm Haruka Fukunaga, and I teach you about makeup.

332
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,920
Are you alone today?

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,640
No, I'm with my senior.

334
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I see.

335
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,640
Let's make sure we both like you guys just like straight up asiskets.

336
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,760
What?

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,480
Yes, okay.

338
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,760
Just go around greeting the others and come back.

339
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,920
All right?

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,040
Well, sorry.

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,320
Haruka?

342
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
Sorry about what Hikaru said.

343
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
I was so scared.

344
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,800
I was totally hopeless.

345
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I don't know what happened,

346
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,200
but there's nothing wrong with you today.

347
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Hikaru...

348
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Well, if there is,

349
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
it's your ugly face that makes you feel confident.

350
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
You're mean!

351
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Beautiful people

352
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
tell you about the person who's confident.

353
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
You cast a spell on me,

354
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
but I have to change.

355
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
You can't lie.

356
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,200
You'll hate yourself.

357
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
What's wrong?

358
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Thank you, Hikaru.

359
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Sorry, Haruka.

360
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
I got caught.

361
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,200
No!

362
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Um...

363
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Mr. Kurotaki!

364
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I was actually

366
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
lying.

367
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Actually,

368
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
today is my first date in my life.

369
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
What?

370
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I was scared of the difference in my life experience

371
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
with you, Mr. Kurotaki.

372
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm sorry I lied.

373
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,200
But I don't want to go home yet.

374
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm so sad.

375
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I want to go on a date with you.

376
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Thank you, Haruka.

377
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
But

378
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm not that amazing.

379
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
And

380
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
I'm not that bad.

381
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
And

382
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I know that you're not used to it.

383
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
But

384
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,200
you took care of me and dressed up.

385
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm happy.

386
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Thank you.

387
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
I'll go get some dessert.

388
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Wait for me.

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Thank goodness.

390
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
You're wearing shoes?

391
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Why do you know?

392
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Who are you talking to?

393
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I was just kidding.

394
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Why are you talking to me?

395
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
It's dangerous for a man to find out about you.

396
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Why can't I?

397
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Why?

398
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Men who pretend to be a woman

399
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
and approach a woman

400
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
are so annoying.

401
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
They're just annoying.

402
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
If you're so annoying,

403
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm going to hate you.

404
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm sure you're not like that.

405
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Show me your feet.

406
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
What?

407
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm fine.

408
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Look.

409
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I'm so lucky.

410
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Wait.

411
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm going to break my arm.

412
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
You can break it with this?

413
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
But it's heavy.

414
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Haruka.

415
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
What?

416
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
This is bad.

417
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
It's the same room as Haruka's.

418
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Is there a problem?

419
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm jealous.

420
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
I wish it was sunny and straight.

421
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I wonder what it's like to be with you.

422
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
What do you think I'm like?

423
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm the happiest when I'm with you.

424
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Take it.

425
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Why did you drink so much?
