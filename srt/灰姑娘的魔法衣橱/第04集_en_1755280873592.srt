1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm a normal guy who's always around.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I want to know about each other first.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm glad you thought about me.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You look like my friend.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I want to be straight and straight.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have a crush on someone.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's your name?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Koichi.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't like you.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've been calling you every day since the camp.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I fell asleep while you were talking.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I was out of breath.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a couple's conversation.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Get closer.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Really?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think we should stay like this.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've been busy lately.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you have a reason to drink?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you confess to me again,

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to know about you first.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want you to know about me first.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think I'm already in love.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you tell me...

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You want me to tell you?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me hear about you.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm more busy with school.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm busy preparing for the school's school festival.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You graduated from a vocational school in two years?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So you can't see Haruko forever?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's done.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's done?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's a big help.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was wondering what would happen if the hair and makeup artist I asked for

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
fell down.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I remembered Koichi saying he was a beauty expert.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're just a student.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's a good thing.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The owner was happy.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's actually a good feeling.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's light.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Owner!

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Koichi is in the middle of a festival.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Please introduce him to us.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you want to be my servant, go ahead.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're a real charm monster.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What do you think of Koichi?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's my favorite.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't care about that.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't want to hear it.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it's a good feeling.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I think he'll be here soon.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why?

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I asked for help.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's here.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh no.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Haruka.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're always different.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm here to buy clothes and Koichi's hair and makeup.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Koichi?

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll introduce him to you.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Koichi?

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Koichi?

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Where did he go?

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is he your friend?

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I saw him in the morning.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He was doing my hair and makeup.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I wanted to introduce him to you.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Really?

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where did he go?

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Where did he go?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Toilet?

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What kind of person is he?

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's a bad person.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But he's actually a good person.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm hungry.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going home.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I suddenly have a stomachache.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are you okay?

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait a minute.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have medicine.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll give it to you.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Toilet.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm hungry.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now's my chance.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What was his name?

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Koichi.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
His bag.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He wasn't here.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hikaru?

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why is Hikaru here?

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, Koichi.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you saying?

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm not wrong about Hikaru.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you doing, Hikaru?

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hikaru?

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well...

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do you mean?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hikaru?

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well...

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You were at the camp with Haruka.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, this is...

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was with Hikaru all the time.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I didn't do anything.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Wait a minute.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is Hikaru a girl?

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well...

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Make-up is amazing.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But why did you say Koichi?

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was just teasing her.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I thought she was being played by a suspicious girl.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was just checking her profile.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But...

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I passed.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hikaru...

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Mr. Koichi, please take number three.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll be right back.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hikaru, I don't think you were teasing her.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I think you lied to me.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Lied?

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was worried about the girl who was with the girl in the dress.

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She said she had a bad impression.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm really sorry.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, no. Haruka doesn't have to apologize.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I see.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But how did you get along with her?

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hikaru cast a spell on me.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's amazing.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm so confident.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's like a magic that gives me courage.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When I'm with Hikaru,

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can like myself.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mr. Kurotaki?

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, no.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thanks for helping me today.

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're welcome.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thanks for sending me.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're welcome.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
See you.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The girl Koichi likes...

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The girl Koichi likes...

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Moisturizing with moisturizing serum.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Warm up your skin as you like.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And wrap your cheeks with both hands.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hikaru said he was going to have a meeting.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll do it.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll do it.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't rely on Hikaru,

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but I don't know what suits him.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Where?

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why are you here?

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Shu told me that you saw Haruka freeze at the cosmetics store.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why don't you rely on me?

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No, I don't.

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hikaru, which one do you want to buy?

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What?

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You fool.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Haruka's skin is different, so the color suits her.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, but this will suit both of you.

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're not here to pick your own color.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What?

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So I want to give Hikaru a present.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What? Why?

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want you to do your best during the holidays.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're always so helpful.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I want to thank you.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're so fast.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're so stupid.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What?

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You don't go to the party dressed like a woman.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm happy today.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm happy with the money, so I'm happy with that.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's okay. I just got a job.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, it's okay.

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No?

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, I'll buy it.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Really?

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let me see.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll take this one each.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hikaru and Sorou.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm embarrassed, so stop it.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's okay. I'm happy.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll never forget that we gave each other presents.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll buy it.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll buy it.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll buy it.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll do my makeup myself.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I want to make Kurotaki a good girl.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm talking about Kurotaki.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He wasn't angry at all.

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He said Hikaru's makeup was good.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, why don't you put on lipstick?

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What?

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Come here.

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No way.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How can I wear it without a mirror?

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well...

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let me.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do I look good?

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Who do you think chose it?

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's right.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Here.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you.

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well...

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's beautiful.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's natural.

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's right.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It looks like Hikaru will be with me when I put this on.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll make you my guardian angel.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll make you my guardian angel.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Are you going to kiss him after I put this on?

246
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Kiss?

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Not yet.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's too early.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey, Jotomo, Hikaru.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you saying?

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's go home.

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's go home.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What?

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's go home.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm embarrassed.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can go ahead.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Okay.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The day after the next day off,

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
will you go out?

261
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll go out.

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There's someone I like.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's right.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There is.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Is it interesting?

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll see you later.

269
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hikaru.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Haruka, that outfit...

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I chose it at the cheap shop that Hikaru told me about.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What do you think?

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Did you do all the hair and makeup alone?

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going to confess to Mr. Kurotaki.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I thought I'd tell Hikaru before that.

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
60 points.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You put too much eyeshadow and too much eyebrow.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Are you going to go with that?

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I've been trying really hard for this.

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is the last time, my princess.

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm just disappointed that Hikaru is doing it.

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's too late.

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You don't have to worry about that.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What?

287
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I lied because if I didn't find out that he was a man,

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I thought I'd be able to be with him after we dated.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's for my own good.

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You were worried about that?

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll be with you forever,

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
whether I date you or not.

293
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hello?

294
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Sorry, can we meet up?

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What's up?

296
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Is there anything you like about Koichi?

297
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He's not here.

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Don't apologize there.

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's what's annoying.

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sorry.

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll make you more angry.

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll apologize later.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're so easy.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I heard from Haruka that you have a friend you like.

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Take good care of her.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If she cries, I'll kill her.

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay, it's done.

310
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you.

311
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you.

312
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're the one Haruka wants, right?

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Not me.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Take good care of her.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We're friends.

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Kurosaki, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

318
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, it's okay.

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Um...

320
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I wanted to see you today.

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Actually, I have something to tell you.

322
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Me too.

323
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I have something to tell you.

324
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have something to tell you.

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Let's date, Haruka.

326
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm her girlfriend.

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I like Haruka.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You really like her?

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What?

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Kensuke?

331
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Look, it's a friend.

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why don't we go out and play?

333
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's okay. Hikaru is with you.
