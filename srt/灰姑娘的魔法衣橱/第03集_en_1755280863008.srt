1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460
Oh, no.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,460
I slipped!

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,840
It's okay. I'm fine.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,880
Let me down.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,100
Be careful.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,800
You're a girl, but you're amazing.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,640
Oh, I was in the sports club.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,640
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,440
Here.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,600
Thank you!

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,480
Mr. Karateki, excuse me.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,520
Oh.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,160
Have we met before?

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,660
What?

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,120
You remember me?

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Hikaru.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,620
I heard from Haruka.

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,120
Mr. Kurotaki is really cool.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,120
Will you be my friend?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,660
Are you being tested?

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
What?

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,660
Haruka is a really good girl.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,660
So I'm worried about who she'll be.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
That's not it.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,660
You're so kind, Hikaru.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Wait.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,160
Sorry!

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,160
No, Hikaru loves Haruka.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,000
What?

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,160
I said no.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,920
You two are friends.

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,420
So what?

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,300
You two are friends?

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,760
What?

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,720
You met by chance and you're being treated?

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
What's that?

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,100
I don't know, but Hikaru is my favorite person.

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
I see.

40
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
Hikaru?

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,700
That's what I'm saying.

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,500
Don't make him cry.

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,420
Mr. Kurotaki.

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Oh.

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,220
I'll get out of your way.

46
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,400
Thanks! I'll call you again!

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,240
Friends.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
What?

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,740
You're still here?

50
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,160
Hikaru!

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,360
You're a junior high school student after dinner?

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,740
Mr. Kurotaki is a nice and mature guy.

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
He's making me a better person.

54
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,580
You're dreaming too much.

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,700
Don't make him a beauty.

56
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,460
You're the one who said it was a rumor.

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
What?

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,460
You're the one who said it was a rumor.

59
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,540
What?

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
You're the one who said it was a rumor.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,600
Hikaru! Look!

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,560
Let's go camping together.

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,560
Invite Hikaru too. Let's have fun.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,980
What?

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Oh!

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Haruka!

67
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Welcome.

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,280
This isn't my campground.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Nice to meet you.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,160
Thanks.

71
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,580
The air is fresh.

72
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,320
Yeah, it's great.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,580
What's with this crowd?

74
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,580
Cheers!

75
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Oh, right. I checked in.

76
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,080
Go get your luggage.

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,660
Thank you!

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
What?

79
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,740
It's the same room as Haruka's.

80
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,820
Yeah.

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Any problem?

82
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
No, thanks.

83
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,980
Okay.

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,560
Oh, that's it!

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Hey.

86
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,560
I was wondering when we'd get in.

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,140
But I'm sure we'll get in.

88
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,220
What?

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,440
I thought I'd manage on my own since I'm not wearing my clothes.

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,980
You'd die if you were licking the mountains.

91
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
It's Bangarou who's stopping me.

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,940
Hey, don't worry about me.

93
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
I'm sure you'd think,

94
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,860
I'm always asking about your love life.

95
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,480
How many have you had?

96
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
A boyfriend?

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Or a girlfriend?

98
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,320
I've never had more than Haruka thought.

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,780
Love isn't for you.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,780
It's a hassle to think about your partner

101
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,080
and be careful.

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,160
It's easier to be alone.

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,700
What?

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
You can't be with someone else.

105
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,760
You didn't have fun with him?

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,300
No, I didn't!

107
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,260
I love being with Hikaru the most.

108
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,180
Ouch!

109
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,300
Are you okay?

110
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
I told you.

111
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,020
Don't tell anyone about that.

112
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,940
I'm not telling anyone.

113
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,360
It's because of Hikaru.

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
You don't have to tell anyone.

115
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,440
I know Hikaru's not mad at me,

116
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
but he's been kind to me.

117
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,220
They're gone.

118
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,560
They're gone.

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,560
Hikaru has approached me.

120
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
Now that you know him,

121
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,820
you know everything about him.

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,620
It's pretty fun, but...

123
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Right?

124
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Let's take a picture together.

125
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,080
I want to see it.

126
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,800
Here. Cheese.

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,540
Smile.

128
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,260
Thank you.

129
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,880
I'll post it on Instagram.

130
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,560
Oh, this is nostalgic.

131
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,020
Look. I made it when I was in high school.

132
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,020
List of things I want to do.

133
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,980
I think I can do this.

134
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,280
I couldn't do it alone.

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,120
But I think I can do it with Hikaru.

136
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I see.

137
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,620
I can do it with Hikaru.

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,740
Please.

139
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,880
Do it with me from now on.

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Are you sure?

141
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
What?

142
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,260
Can I do it with you?

143
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,180
Are you ready?

144
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,060
It's already that late?

145
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,220
I'll go first.

146
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,480
Wait.

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,100
Hikaru, give me the key.

148
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,380
I'll be right there.

149
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,220
I guess I'm just a friend.

150
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,440
Sorry I'm late.

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,240
It's Haruka. I heard from Keisuke.

152
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,740
Nice to meet you.

153
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,080
There's sake in there. Take whatever you want.

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Thank you.

155
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,860
Keisuke, want some?

156
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,900
He's just about to.

157
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,740
Take it.

158
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Thanks.

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,860
Here.

160
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,320
Thanks.

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Haruka.

162
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,780
Go help him.

163
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,240
Okay.

164
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,740
I can't help it.

165
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,400
I can't move unless I'm being pushed around.

166
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,900
You're right.

167
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,860
If you insist, I'll go with you.

168
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,780
I'll go alone today.

169
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
What?

170
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,080
I can't be spoiled by Hikaru forever.

171
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,200
I'll do my best.

172
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
No.

173
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,080
You said you'd do your best.

174
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
I'll do my best.

175
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
You'll do your best?

176
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
I'll do my best.

177
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,700
I'm surprised you like outdoor.

178
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Really?

179
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,620
I think I can enjoy it with you.

180
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I have to do this seriously.

181
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,620
Keisuke, you're here.

182
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm here.

183
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
I'm here.

184
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
I'm here.

185
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
I'm here.

186
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm here.

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm here.

188
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm glad you invited me today.

189
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,960
I thought so too.

190
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,120
It's fun to do it together.

191
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,420
Um...

192
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Yes?

193
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,340
What do you think I look like in your eyes?

194
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
What?

195
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
It's hot.

196
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
It's hot.

197
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
It's hot.

198
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,980
I just want to make sure.

199
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Haruka, you can call me your fan.

200
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Yes!

201
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Yes!

202
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,980
You did your best for me.

203
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
I'm happy.

204
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,400
And you always try your best at work.

205
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,980
I like that.

206
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
So...

207
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,980
I'm not thinking about...

208
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
...going out with Haruka...

209
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,480
...right now.

210
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Not now.

211
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Not now?

212
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,980
Well...

213
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Well...

214
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,980
I don't look like a prince in Haruka's eyes.

215
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
How do you know?

216
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,400
I was told I was different from what I thought...

217
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
...when I dated her.

218
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,740
You dream too much.

219
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,980
You don't understand her.

220
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm a child.

221
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
I'm a fool.

222
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,980
I'm just a normal guy.

223
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,980
So I want to know about each other first.

224
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,980
I'm sorry I did this.

225
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,980
It's okay.

226
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,980
I was just thinking about it.

227
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,980
I'm glad you were thinking about it.

228
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,980
I want you to know more about yourself.

229
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,980
I'll do my best!

230
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Are you okay? You drank too much.

231
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,980
I feel like I want to drink.

232
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
Hurry up!

233
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,980
You're angry? What's wrong?

234
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,980
Shut up.

235
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,980
Haruka didn't date you.

236
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,980
I didn't.

237
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Watch out!

238
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,980
Let's go back.

239
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,180
Sorry, Mr. Otsuki. We're going home.

240
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,980
I'm going home?

241
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,980
I hate this.

242
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,980
Be careful!

243
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,180
No, no.

244
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,980
Be careful.

245
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,980
Haruka, take off your makeup sheet.

246
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,680
She's so conscious of beauty.

247
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,180
What?

248
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,680
Here it is.

249
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
Here.

250
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,180
What?

251
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,680
Hey, Hikaru!

252
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,680
Take it off.

253
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,680
Hikaru is jealous?

254
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,680
What are you laughing at?

255
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,680
I'm always the one who's reliable.

256
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm glad you're being spoiled by Hikaru.

257
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Why did you drink so much?

258
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Why?

259
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Because I'm curious.

260
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
I know you're curious.

261
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,680
What were you talking about with Kurotaki?

262
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,680
About dating him?

263
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
About dating him.

264
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
You're wearing a suit.

266
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,680
You're too much.

267
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
I'm going to take a shower.

268
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
You idiot!

269
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
I'm going to take a shower.

270
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
What do you want to do?

271
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
Do it with me.

272
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,680
We can do it all together.

273
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,680
Are you going to Tokyo with your sister?

274
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
You have one, right?

275
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
No.

276
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,680
What?

277
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,680
Really?

278
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,680
You look like my friend.

279
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,680
I thought you were twins.

280
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Really?

281
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,680
Well...

282
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Wait!

283
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
Take a picture with me.

284
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
Haruka will be surprised.

285
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,680
Shut up.

286
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,680
You don't know anything about photography.

287
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
I'm Hiketsuke Kurotaki.

288
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm not interested.

289
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,680
Sorry.

290
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,680
What's your name?

291
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
You...

292
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
You don't have any worries, do you?

293
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,680
You think the answer will come back if you ask.

294
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
I envy you.

295
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
You're so straightforward.

296
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
But...

297
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I think that's good.

298
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Sorry.

299
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,680
Who are you talking about?

300
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
There's someone I like.

301
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,680
No!

302
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Yes, there is.

303
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
You're just a guy.

304
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,680
You're not bad. Sorry.

305
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,680
You're bright, refreshing, and a good guy.

306
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
What?

307
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
How do you know?

308
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,680
I guess I am.

309
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I'm not good at all.

310
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
What?

311
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,680
There was a guy who confessed to me like a good guy.

312
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
I couldn't accept it.

313
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
What?

314
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
He was too good.

315
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I thought I was really okay.

316
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Like you said, I'm a bit cold and cold.

317
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,680
I'm scared of hurting her.

318
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,680
So I said something I couldn't say.

319
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Sorry.

320
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
I said something to the first person I met.

321
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll tell you what you said to a woman in your life.

322
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
What?

323
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Why don't you understand?

324
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
If you don't, then forget it.

325
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Think about how I feel.

326
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Are you jealous?

327
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
But you're not mean.

328
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
You're a coward.

329
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
You're a coward.

330
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Love is a relationship, so you have to say it.

331
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
But you're not kind.

332
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,680
You're so kind to me.

333
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
What?

334
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Tell me your contact number.

335
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Why?

336
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I need to talk to you.

337
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Why?

338
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
It's a real weather.

339
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Tell me.

340
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Thank you.

341
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
What's your name?

342
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
propose

343
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Koichi.

344
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Don't look.

345
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
My dream

346
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Mr.

347
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
That's right.

348
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Forget it.

349
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,540
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use the

350
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,200
same thing as the

351
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,540
other one, but I think it's a good idea to use it.

352
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,540
I think it's a good idea to use it.

353
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,540
I think it's a good idea to use it.

354
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,540
I think it's a good idea to use it.

355
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,540
I think it's a good idea to use it.

356
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,540
I think it's a good idea to use it.
