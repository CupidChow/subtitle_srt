1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to be a good friend to many people.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to work at a cafe.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to be fashionable.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm going to spend a fulfilling campus life.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to make a boyfriend.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to have a wonderful love.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Haruka, let's go.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But it's graduation.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm so happy.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let me stay when I go to Tokyo.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
OK.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm looking forward to it.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm waiting for you to be a city girl.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
OK.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Cheese.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tokyo

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's hot.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Are you OK?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you OK?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm OK.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's OK.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sorry.

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Excuse me.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,500
Yes?

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,700
Is Kurotaki here?

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,000
He's on break. He'll be here soon.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
I'm sorry. Can you throw this away?

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,500
Yes!

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,200
Kurotaki has a lot of friends.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
He does.

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
My dream was to study while drinking.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,000
To buy drinks that are over 500 yen.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Lunch is worth a meal.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Right?

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey!

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The empty bill please.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll take it.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,500
The reality is so harsh.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll change.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kurotaki!

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,500
This is 20kg.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't push yourself.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm fine. I have muscles.

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Haruka, you don't trust me that much.

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
That's not the case.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Serious?

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Move.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're a good listener.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Isn't that right, Kurotaki?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm home.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What a terrible room.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What a terrible room.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can sleep like this.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sleepy mother.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm home.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What the hell!

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Cute!

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When I was longing for Tokyo,

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I was more like a girl.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Sorry!

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What?

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is something on your face?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can see it.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was just fascinated by how beautiful you are.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thanks.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Beautiful people are different.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want to do my makeup,

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but I'm too busy and I don't have money.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm always thinking about it.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Did someone complain about you being a virgin?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Not really.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then, it's fine.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just be yourself.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you're beautiful, you have to work hard.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Eat it while it's hot.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I guess I can't today.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Today?

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was thinking of drinking after work.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Again?

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry I'm so busy.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Busy?

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you break up with your girlfriend?

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bingo!

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please comfort me.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You didn't call me during school.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're self-sufficient.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't eat, but how about a drink?

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm still a minor.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're still a 19?

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When is your birthday?

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Next Tuesday.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's fast.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go drink.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sorry.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Did you just say you were going to drink?

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What should I do?

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're so young.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh no!

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm so worried.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's my birthday.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm so glad you invited me.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have to do something.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Make up first.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Lip, foundation, eye makeup.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Lip.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's that makeup you wore the other day?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have a celebration on my birthday.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I want to know how to do my makeup today.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
How do I do my long eyelashes?

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What do I do with my skin?

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do you do with that scent?

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was in a hurry.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Which one should I buy?

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A beauty product.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Fixer?

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's that?

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is for your eyelashes.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's easy to apply because the brush is curved.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It has fiber, so I recommend it.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's hard to get rid of with just cleansing.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Buy eye makeup remover and a set.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Here.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And...

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think it's around here.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Excuse me.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank you.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think you know it's a good place to do it.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But it's not good to copy others.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Here you go.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What was it?

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What?

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Haruko!

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Kuzu!

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
K-Kagurotaki!

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What are you doing?

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well...

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm trying to be cute for you.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I can't say that.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you playing with your friends?

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What?

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm going to work now.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's fun.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's fun, isn't it?

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't need this anymore.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What?

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I thought I promised you.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It was just me.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
With that guy?

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I was expecting it.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm an idiot.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're not an idiot.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You wanted to be cute for the person you love.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's natural for a girl.

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A girl?

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What am I?

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thank you.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
How was it?

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was going to do my best.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I couldn't.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I didn't want to be a part of it.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I didn't have the confidence.

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I didn't know what to do.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I didn't know what to do.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I didn't know what to do.

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I didn't know what to do.

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't have the confidence.

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's go.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Good morning.

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Good morning.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Good morning.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm studying hair and makeup here.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're going to be a good student.

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm going to be a good student.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to be a good student.

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to be a good student.

193
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm studying hair and makeup here.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Sit down.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, I'm not.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you're over 20, you're going to be in charge of the booth.

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't get the wrong idea.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not talking about looks.

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I said I'm not cute even if I laugh at myself.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Sit down.

201
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll cast a spell on you.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're so confident that you can't even say what the outside world says.

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's go.

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's go.

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's go.

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm so tired today.

210
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you know the meaning of the word?

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Clouds...

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you for your hard work.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Haruka?

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Yes?

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What's wrong?

216
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
A wedding?

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
What?

218
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Well...

219
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,000
I was really surprised.

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
That's what I'm dressed like.

221
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
You're cute.

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,500
Hey, Kurosaki. We're taking pictures.

223
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm coming.

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Bye.

225
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
This magic is my magic.

226
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,000
You'll be the ones to use it today.

227
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Anon!

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I...

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was really...

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was really waiting for you.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

232
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't think you remember, but...

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Today, on your 20th birthday...

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You said you wanted to go drink with me.

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well...

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So...

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was really looking forward to it.

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm the worst.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, I just thought it was today.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I didn't check it properly.

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Sorry.

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I was rude.

243
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm really sorry.

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm going ahead.

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No, no.

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry for getting in your way.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Thank you for your hard work.

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wait.

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Listen.

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I want you to make it up to me next time.

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

252
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So...

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Not just drinking...

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's go on a date.

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The kindness that blooms in the spring breeze

256
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Even if it's a fake and you laugh

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you say it's true

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes.

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Our family is a cabbage farmer.

260
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So...

261
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What's the matter?

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I want to thank you.

263
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And...

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I have a favor to ask.

265
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Could you tell me about Hikaru's magic?

266
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

267
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to be able to give myself confidence.

268
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I want to be myself in front of the person I like.

269
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I want to like myself.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Please.

271
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll tell you.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,620
The person who used to be a

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not kind to be spoiled.

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I did it!

275
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I knew it.

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hikaru is pretty kind.

277
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're really a human being.

278
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Cheers to our meeting!

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Cheers.

280
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Cheers to our meeting!

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Cheers.

282
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Here.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Eat it.

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Eat it first.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why?

286
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let me eat it.

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Please eat it.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Listen.

289
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't eat fried food.

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why?

291
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Please eat it.

292
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll eat the fried chicken.

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Please eat the fried chicken.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What?

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The room is clean?

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's really clean!

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's really clean!

298
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's really clean!

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's really clean!

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's really clean!

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It can't be.

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You drunkard.

303
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Who?

304
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hey.

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hey.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The magician you called.

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What?

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You asked for it.

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Mr. Hikaru?

310
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hikaru.

311
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey.

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Stop being such a man.

313
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Just let me be.

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hey.

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I wanted to be friends with Hikaru.

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You went on a date with that face?

317
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I answered that a girl I like came.

318
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm scared that Kurotaki will find out that I'm a man.

319
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I was actually lying.

320
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Thank you.

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're a girlfriend?
