00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,300
 Episode 24

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:11,680

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,060
There is another reason, right?

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,580
Teacher Joo didn't do that all because of Aunt.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,450
There is another reason.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,700
Are you able to pick up on things because you are smart

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,990
or is it because you really like Seo Yeon a lot.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,460
It actually seems like both.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,780
But you are also a grandson of Sinhwa Food.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,340
Isn't your situation not much different from Lee Kang Woo's?

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,650
Do you think your parents will accept Seo Yeon easily?

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,670
- I'm a black sheep. 
 - Pardon?

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,120
I gave up my parents.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,140
That was out of context.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,480
Even a graduate from the mighty Hanguk University Medical School is weak in Korean.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,770
Hey! Hey!

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,360
This way!  If you go straight this way, you'll find the track team's office!

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,090
What? Okay.

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,690
At this rate, she is going to die.

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,760
 The moment you want to give up is the moment you start over.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,890
 We have an obligation to be eaten by Joo Seo Yeon.

22
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,930
Strange person...

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,290
No matter how I think about it, I had stopped her from dating him at first.

24
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,060
I'm talking about Joo Seo Yeon! Now that I've come to my senses, I was

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,340
begging her to keep dating our Kang Woo.

26
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,150
You stopped her from dating him.

27
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,480
- Does she look healthy? 
 - Pardon?

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,620
No... If Kang Woo likes her that much, isn't there a reason...

29
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,550
- Mother-in-law! 
- That surprised me.

30
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,550
Oh, what reason!

31
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,860
No, I mean— You're here without contacting us?

32
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,460
I'm a grandson here, the grandson of Sinhwa Food.

33
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,320
You— You're hungry, right son? I'll prepare your food, wait for a little.

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,730
So you were very hungry, my son.

35
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,560
It's delicious, Sinhwa Food's side dishes.

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,590
Ah, hey—

37
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,330
Hey.

38
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,290
Are you okay?

39
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,810
Are you on my side?

40
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,480
- No.
- Aish... 
- Hey.

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,410
I can't help but be on Mom's side because I love your mom.

42
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,340
Despite that, stay strong.

43
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,280
Dad, how did you give it up? Drawing, I mean.

44
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,800
I didn't give it up. I just keep it in here

45
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,360
for your mom and grandmother.

46
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,480
Do I have to do that too?

47
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,340
Can you?

48
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,750
No, I cannot.

49
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,040
That's why I'm telling you to be strong.

50
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,930
Ah, and... Can't you wear your clothes properly?

51
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,490
How does a person who makes clothes look like?

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,410
A person who makes clothes?  Did he find out?

53
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,540
Everything is ruined. How did he know?

54
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,160
Did Hyeon Soo tell him?  I don't think so.

55
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,110
Yes.  I sent you money. Just use it to temporarily solve the problem.

56
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,100
 My Room

57
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,470
Money? Where did she get the money to send from?

58
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,430
What on earth is Lee Joo Hee going around doing?

59
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,600
 Lee Joo Hee?  What is it with your appearance?

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,050
Hey, no way! No way, Lee Joo Hee isn't...

61
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,910
No way, my butt!  She used to work at a wine bar.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,660
Noona!

63
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,020
That scared me! Don't you knock, you bastard!?

64
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,230
- Oh, sorry. Are you busy right now? 
 -  I'm busy.

65
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,610
- Are you really busy? 
 - Why?

66
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,210
Seo Joon's business seems really urgent, so I'll do this a bit later.

67
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,800
You sit down.  And you close the door!

68
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,130
Miss Baek Jang Mi, don't you have something to say to me?

69
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,540
You really don't have a place to stay or no family?

70
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,770
I'm sorry, but I would like you to leave this house.

71
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,230
I have...

72
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,790
a family.

73
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,810
But... I'm not a family to them.

74
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,750
What?

75
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,740
To them, I'm just an item.

76
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,740
An item to be sold at a high price.

77
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,730
What does that mean?

78
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,720
Thank you very much for letting me stay. I've caused you too much inconvenience.

79
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,050
You don't need

80
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,930
to rush yourself.  You may take your time to leave.

81
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,030
In return, don't meddle into my family's matters.

82
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,000
By the way, Lee Kang Woo...

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,610
Miss Jang Mi, didn't we just make an agreement?

84
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,560
He was loitering in front of the house for a while.

85
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,590
You should've told me sooner!

86
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,300
Oh, what should I do?

87
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,300
 Seo Yeon, let's play!

88
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,430
Hey. What's with you? Why haven't you been picking up your phone?

89
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,050
You should've kept on avoiding me. Why did you come?

90
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,100
Because I missed you.

91
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,900
You haven't changed your expression. I came in vain.

92
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,950
Lee Kang Woo.

93
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:35,030
Lee Kang Woo! 
 ♫  Do you remember?   ♫

94
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,450
♫  Our past story  ♫

95
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,930
You really!

96
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,950
Why am I avoiding you? Because I don't want to hear you. And what you're going to say is too obvious!

97
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,440
Because if I don't want to hear what you have to say, there's no other way but avoiding you.

98
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,340
Because the only thing I can do... is just that.

99
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,290
Lee Kang Woo.

100
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,900
So, move out of the way.

101
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,150
Forget it. I'll just leave it, I guess.

102
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,850
I got it. I said I got it.

103
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,430
♫  Wandering around your empty place, I missed you  ♫

104
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,120
♫  Wandering around your empty place, I missed you  ♫

105
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,060
♫  My painful heart is covered with tears  ♫

106
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:41,150
♫  I don't even know whether even a smarting wound hurts  ♫

107
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,840
♫  Do you know the days I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

108
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:52,870
♫  Do you know the days I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

109
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,700
Why does he look so distressed?

110
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,980
♬  If you stay for this minute  ♬

111
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,010
 Lee Kang Hee 
♬  Girl, I'll never let you down  ♬

112
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,850
♬  We ain't off the limit  ♬

113
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,220
 Lee Kang Hee 
♬  I could hold you after now  ♬

114
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,330
♬  No more talking  ♬

115
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,610
 Phone is not connected so this call goes to the voice mail...

116
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,940
Did something happen?

117
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,620
I'm crazy.

118
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,550
Coming all this way.

119
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,580
This is an interesting place.

120
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,680
How did you come here?

121
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,530
I told you I know all of your private information.

122
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,020
Looking at you, it doesn't seem like you're very busy.

123
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,480
Be quiet, quiet! Sh!

124
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,360
What are you doing right now?

125
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,980
Joo Won Jae, please don't give the cat any stress and just come out.

126
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
You don't look any different from last time.

127
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,820
I did put some efforts on coordinating my outfit last time.

128
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,930
- Why were you avoiding my phone calls? 
 - I didn't.

129
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,250
Looking at you, I think you didn't answer on purpose.

130
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,350
Why didn't you?

131
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm shabby and worn out.

132
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm not pure nor beautiful like you.  I used to live off women.

133
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,400
I know.  You approached me for that purpose in the beginning.

134
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,530
Yes. I'm that kind of guy.

135
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,890
That's why I'm frustrated when I'm next to you.

136
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,810
Did I demand more from you than the contents on the contract?

137
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,200
- If that's so— 
 - I'm not talking about the contract.

138
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,400
Yes. The contract. Let's just say it doesn't exist.

139
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,930
I don't want to make money using you any more, Lee Kang Hee.

140
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,530
Go safely.

141
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,230
 Phone is not connected so this call goes to the voice ma—

142
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,150
This punk Lee Kang Woo doesn't come to meetings and doesn't answer phones.

143
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,770
 Do I order around my subordinate to do something or do I wait on him?

144
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,440
Ah, what is this smell?

145
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,860
What's all of this?

146
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,560
- Were you just eating that one while pooping? 
 - Why are you here?

147
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,890
Did you forget our meeting today?

148
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,490
Oh, that's right. Sorry, I was busy.

149
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,820
You're busy? Doing what?

150
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,500
Eating and pooping?

151
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,110
I already prepared all the data.  I'll bring it.

152
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,260
Are you okay? Huh? Hey!

153
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,650
Come here, get up. H-Hey, you!

154
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,280
B-B-Blood! Blood!

155
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,600
Why does he act like this again?

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,020
Ah, that surprised me!

157
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,840
So Lee Kang Woo is meeting with you?

158
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,780
What?

159
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,420
Is Lee Kang Woo home?

160
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,350
Yeah. Do you want to go in?

161
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,010
No! Next time, not today.

162
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,780
- What are you doing? 
 - Huh?

163
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,040
I'll leave in a bit. Don't pay attention to me and leave.

164
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,110
  Yes?

165
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,930
Hey, Joo Seo Yeon is in front of your house right now.

166
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,570
 What?! Don't open the door for her!

167
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,620
 - If you open the door for her, I'll kill you, Park Hyeon Soo– 
- Okay, I got it, I got it.

168
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,810
Ah, what the heck—

169
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,290
What on earth is going on?

170
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,490
 Why am I avoiding you? Because I don't want to hear you.

171
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,560
 And what you're going to say is too obvious!

172
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,260
 Because if I don't want to hear what you have to say, there's no other way but avoiding you.

173
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,510
 Because the only thing I can do is just that.

174
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:29,060
♫  Meeting  by chance, a person who leaves me only sadness  ♫

175
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,820
♫  Becoming a small candle in my heart  ♫

176
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:43,570
I begged her so much but she was here again?

177
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,060
♫  I want to shout to call you  ♫

178
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,680
So she wants to do it anyway after all, right?

179
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
 I just realized your position and mine.

180
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,380
 So, Lee Kang Woo, let's break up now.

181
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,100
♫  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♫

182
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,340
♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore   ♫

183
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:16,880
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

184
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,380
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

185
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,670
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

186
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,550
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

187
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,860
Go home.

188
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,560
Even if you wait, I won't go out.

189
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:16,240
♫  Like the small leaves falling on the ground  ♫

190
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,020
♫  My heart has no place to go  ♫

191
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,700
♫  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♫

192
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,880
♫  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♫

193
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,380
Just today...

194
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,880
♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore   ♫

195
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,870
I just delay one more day, today.

196
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,220
♫  If I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

197
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,110
♫  If I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

198
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,600
Just today...

199
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,530
 I'll be a shameless daughter.

200
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,680
 I'm sorry.

201
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,990
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

202
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,710
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

203
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,540
Only one day...

204
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,630
You're just giving one day to me?

205
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,530
Joo Seo Yeon?

206
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,680
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

207
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,410
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

208
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:33,440
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

209
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,450
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

210
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,370
 Really, that's only reason?

211
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,450
 Are you saying there's another reason?

212
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,090
 I'm saying there is possibility.

213
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,990
Another reason?

214
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,130
I heard she is a teacher here.  What kind of person is she?

215
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,200
She is a good person, who I want to have.

216
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Is that so?

217
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,460
What good is it?  Her family history is so complicated.

218
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,180
Her parents passed early and she even has step-siblings.  Even if she has only one fault, I'm not sure if we would accept her.

219
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,720
What do you...

220
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,690
Oh, you didn't know that yet.

221
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,540
In truth, you don't need to know every teacher's family history.

222
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,800
Does Hyung know?

223
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,000
I think he knows it.  He wouldn't care about it even if he knew it.

224
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,200
You console Kang Woo well.

225
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm so scared that he might cause some trouble.

226
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,330
Yes.

227
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,700
Okay.

228
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,860
Thank you.

229
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,520
You should go home, Uncle.

230
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,380
Don't come out! Work hard.

231
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,840
 Her parents passed early and she even has step-siblings.

232
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,900
  Even if she has only one fault, I'm not sure if we would accept her.

233
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,050
How is your ankle?

234
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,260
It's fine.

235
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,770
Chief Director Lee?

236
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,550
What?

237
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,570
I think other people think it's odd if you keep coming by the track office.

238
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,220
- So— 
 - I became a chief director to do that.

239
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,290
And to be seen.

240
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,620
I hope everybody notices I like Teacher Joo.

241
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,810
It'll rain later.  I think you didn't bring an umbrella.

242
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:20,190
When I was going to school, and it rained suddenly, then everyone's parents would come with umbrellas.

243
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,900
I was really envious of them.

244
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,280
Because my parents never did that.

245
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,840
Were you never envious, Teacher Joo?

246
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,700
Of parents' coming with umbrellas when it rained?

247
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,040
I'll come again.

248
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,390
What happened to Mom in this hour?

249
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,350
Who...?

250
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,700
Why you?

251
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,990
He said he is a brother of Student Lee Kang Wook in your class.

252
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,530
Saying he needs some consultation about Student Lee Kang Wook's matter.

253
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,160
Lee Kang Wook?

254
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,110
You know Lee Kang Wook, don't you?

255
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,000
Well, he is tall and white like bleached flour dough?

256
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,890
I need to go to the restroom.

257
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,200
Follow me.

258
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,350
I also need to go to the bathroom.

259
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,710
Let me see...

260
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,850
Is there a student named Lee Kang Wook in Teacher Kim's class?

261
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,880
I'm not sure... Seeing I don't remember him particularly...

262
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,060
He must be a kid who doesn't get good grades.

263
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,870
That's it, that's it.

264
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,000
That's why I couldn't remember him.  That's why.

265
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,500
The weather is nice.

266
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,560
Are you crazy? How could you come here to find me?

267
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,580
Quickly go.

268
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,660
- What is this? 
 - Lee Kang Woo is dying by bleeding.

269
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,040
Did Lee Kang Woo get into an accident?

270
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,390
His heart's blood.

271
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,320
It's because of Joo Seo Yeon, right?

272
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,910
You don't have to know.

273
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,910
Why don't I need to know?  I have so many troubles with my business because of him.

274
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,710
I said you don't have to know! The two of them will figure it out by themselves.

275
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,690
Mom, I'm busy, so call me later—

276
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,820
Why are you being like this? Don't cry and tell me!

277
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,460
I got it. I got it, so hang up for now.

278
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,800
What happened?

279
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,220
Can you give me a ride to the bus terminal?

280
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,640
Okay. Let's go.

281
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,130
Type in the address.

282
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,990
That's okay, so just bring me to the terminal.

283
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,270
Joo Seo Yeon knows your address, right? Joo Seo Yeon hasn't gone home yet, right?

284
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,280
She is in a very complicated situation right now.  I don't want to add my problem to her.

285
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,050
Type it in.

286
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,940
Don't ask anything.

287
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,790
 Your destination will be instructed.

288
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,820
Your hands are cold, aren't they?

289
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,040
Mom, I'm on my way right now.

290
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,980
Stay calm, nothing serious will happen.

291
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,800
Seriously! Why would you die?

292
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,850
You know, how much medical technology has developed these days.

293
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,400
If you have a thorough medical examination and get surgery done, you'll be okay.

294
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,900
Don't worry and hang up.

295
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,870
If my mom dies, then I'll die, too!

296
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,660
Hey, you. Why do you say such horrible words?

297
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,980
Don't cry!

298
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,490
I'm telling you not to cry!

299
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,270
Stop!

300
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,170
Don't cry.

301
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,220
 Joo Seo Yeon

302
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,050
 Phone is not connected so this call goes to the voice mail...

303
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,040
 Come to my house. I'll listen to you.

304
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,150
I can do this.

305
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,520
I can do this.

306
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,370
Lee Kang Woo.

307
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,110
What happened to your lips?

308
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,070
I don't understand. No matter what you say, I don't think I'll understand.

309
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,540
Is that really the reason? The fact that I'm a grandson of Sinhwa Food?

310
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,170
If that's the reason, I'll take care of it.  Why are you so scared in advance that you give up me?

311
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,440
How could you let go of me so easily—

312
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,930
There is one–a different reason.

313
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,110
What on earth is it?

314
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,180
What exactly is the reason?

315
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,690
- Lee Kang Woo... 
- What on earth is it?

316
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,290
I don't love you.

317
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,290
That's the reason.

318
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,470
You called me Kang Woo!

319
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,560
You called me by saying, 'Kang Woo'.

320
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,440
If you were going to act like this, why did you call me like that?

321
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,360
Move out of the way.

322
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,770
You're very bad.

323
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:06,350
You're bad! But I can't bring myself to hate you.

324
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,690
I'm the guy who never hates you even if I die.

325
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,400
I told you to move.

326
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,220
I got it. I understand everything, so

327
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,090
just play around with me and then throw me away.

328
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,140
Can't you do that?

329
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,590
Come to your senses, Lee Kang Woo. I think you're crazy.

330
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:39,930
♫  Even if I shout while looking at the empty sky, you don't answer back  ♫

331
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:47,330
♫  Do you know my sad tears that I couldn't even forget?  ♫

332
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,520
♫  Do you hear my voice?  ♫

333
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:56,530
♫  Thinking you might come back all day long every day  ♫

334
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:04,860
♫  Wandering around your empty place, I missed you  ♫

335
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,950
♫  My painful heart is covered with tears  ♫

336
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,440
♫  I don't even know whether even a smarting wound hurts  ♫

337
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,520
She must be getting rained on.

338
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,490
Joo Seo Yeon.

339
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:29,100
♫  Do you know I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

340
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:39,670

341
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,420
I told you it was going to rain.

342
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,330
I came to pick you up.

343
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:55,560
I... like Lee Kang Woo.

344
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,910
I know.

345
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm going to keep on liking him by myself.

346
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:07,060
I also keep liking you by myself.

347
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,460
You're really a weird person.

348
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,400
♫  Thinking you might come back all day long every day  ♫

349
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:30,880
♫  Wandering around your empty place, I missed you  ♫

350
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,870
♫  My painful heart is already covered with tears  ♫

351
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:44,010
♫  I don't even know whether even a smarting wound hurts  ♫

352
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:52,330
♫  Do you know I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

353
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:58,260
♫  Look at my tears  ♫

354
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,800
♫  You don't have to say anything,  just smile at me  ♫

355
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,770
 Love With Flaws

356
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,620
 Joo Seo Yeon! You can't cry, though.

357
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,440
 Please don't draw a line even to me.  I beg you.

358
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,230
 What's with you?

359
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,440
 Are you really asking because you don't know? Why do you think I'm being like this?

360
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,240
 You did all sorts of things and now you even work at the bar?

361
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,880
 Do you think you're something to me because we live together?

362
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,540
 Do they live together?

363
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,210
 Are you going to end with Seo Yeon like this?

364
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,480
 Should I tell everything to Lee Kang Woo and just die bravely?

365
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,070
 Is it reall. because of me?

366
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,000
 Why is Lee Kang Woo...

367
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,990
 I'm telling you he got into an accident. An accident!

368
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,460
 I'm sorry I dared to want Joo Seo Yeon.

369
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,680
♫  I'm waiting for your love  ♫
