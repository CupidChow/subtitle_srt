00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,550
 Episode 22

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,790
I'm sorry we couldn't tell you right away.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,880
I was fifteen years old back then.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,540
If I knew then, I wouldn't have been able to endure it.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,300
♬  But it's killing me to see you go after all this time  ♬

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,190
Until now, you two worried about me and tried to protect me.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,940
I know all.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,150
Thank you.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,750
Our Seo Yeon... is all grown up now.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,230
I thought you'd hate us and resent us for not telling you.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,850
Elder Oppa... are you crying?

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,590
Crying? As if!

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,010
Why are you crying?

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,270
I'm not, you punk!

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,310
I'm not crying.

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,030
Leave him alone.  He is in the andropause.

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,300
Still... Even if you're all grown up, drinking in front of your older brothers is a little too much.

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,830
I drink a lot in front of Second Oppa.

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,790
I'm a regular at his bar.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,000
You punk, not only do you not stop her from drinking but your  give  her drinks?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,950
Her tolerance for alcohol is higher than yours.

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,290
No way.  You should learn how to drink from the oldest brother.

23
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,920
Here.

24
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,140
Be quiet. Elder Oppa can't drink at all.

25
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,900
He doesn't live up to his body size.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,840
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,430
Seo Yeon... This oppa is sorry!

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,200
Please!

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,920
I wondered who made such a noise but it's you, Eldest Brother.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,100
Our youngest!  Our little puppy!

31
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,960
Hyung is sorry.

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,850
I'm sorry, Seo Joon.

34
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,840
You're heavy!

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm sorry to Seo Joon!

36
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,100
Why did you drink so much?

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,700
Ah seriously.

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,710
- It's Noona's boyfriend. 
 - What?

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,350
Go inside first.

40
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,860
I'll introduce myself again. I'm Lee Kang Woo.

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,800
Go inside.

42
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,760
- That rascal did—
 - Let's get inside!

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,460
- He did— 
 - I told you to get inside!

44
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,440
 Please—

45
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,310
You bother me.

46
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,650
Oppa.

47
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,110
What is it, Joo Seo Yeon?

48
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,680
Did your battery go out? Is it broken?

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,800
Never mind. There must be a situation.

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,390
Are you tired of me?

51
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,890
I'm sorry, Lee Kang Woo.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,980
No, it's okay.

53
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm not that angry.

54
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,930
♬  I purposefully take a few steps back  ♬

55
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,640
♬  I look at you walking without me  ♬

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,220
♬  I look at you  ♬

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,840
♬  There is a void beside you  ♬

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,130
But... Why didn't you contact me today?

59
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
Because I thought I'd want to see you if I heard your voice.

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,520
Don't you like me too much, Joo Seo Yeon? Do it moderately.

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,280
No, I cancel what I just said.

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Like me like crazy!

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,580
Completely!

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,350
Got it?

65
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,960
You're heavy.

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,460
Even if I'm heavy, endure it.

67
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,950
Joo Seo Yeon is a woman who can bear this much weight.

68
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,820
Kang Woo...

69
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,130
What did you just say?

70
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,440
Not 'Lee Kang Woo', you said 'Kang Woo', right?

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,650
If I'm mean to you in the future, hate me a lot.

72
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,200
- What? 
- You have to curse at me and resent me, okay?

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,150
Don't hold back. You got that?

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,770
You got it?

75
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,830
But no matter how mean you are to me,

76
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,380
if you just call me by saying 'Kang Woo',

77
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,240
I think it will be okay.

78
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,070
So, if there's anything that makes you sad or angry,

79
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,850
vent it all on me. Everything.

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,050
Now I won't bother you.

81
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,200
When you have time, call me.

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,150
Even if I want to hear your voice, I'll hold back.  Even if I miss you, I'll hold back as well.

83
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,440
I'll wait for you quietly.

84
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,040
Go in.

85
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,840
After I see you leave.

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,940
Okay, then.

87
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm leaving.

88
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,880
Bye-bye.

89
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,540
You're dating him again?

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,370
No.

91
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,260
It's a no again?

92
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,460
Is it him?

93
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,190
The one you went to meet with mother and father on the day of the accident.

94
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,760
Your middle school classmate and the one you wronged back then, right?

95
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,120
Are you okay?

96
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,660
If I'm having a hard time, help me, Younger Oppa.

97
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,830
Anytime.

98
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,860
That easily?

99
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,010
She's acting like she's okay, isn't she?

100
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,870
You're awake already?

101
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,220
I get drunk fast and sober up fast too.

102
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,230
Watch her carefully!

103
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,450
She is hanging by a thread right now.

104
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,670
You're still not asleep?

105
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,360
Don't worry. I'll protect you, Unni.

106
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,470
His eyes, nose, and mouth are all the same.

107
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,230
They are the same person.

108
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,910
 I told them to go. It was because of me

109
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,870
 that Mom and Dad died. Because of me...

110
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,200
 Seo Yeon...

111
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,460
 It's because of me that Mom and Dad died.

112
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,540
No, it's because of this person.

113
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,070
They said he was Sinhwa Food's grandson, right?

114
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,790
What do you do in your free time, Noona?

115
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,440
- Huh?
 - What?

116
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,320
I said, what do you do in your free time?

117
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,810
- What?! 
- I heard you got fired from your chief director position.

118
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,060
I heard you were going to come in the headquarters. That is the last quarter's performance reports.  Just look at them.

119
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,090
Why should I look at them?  You know very well what I am doing.

120
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,910
Are you doing it?  If you do, can you have free time?

121
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,690
You're doing it while playing around.

122
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,510
When you said you didn't need two jobs, I thought you were doing it very seriously.

123
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,660
That...

124
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,560
Working hours and this kind of hours are different.

125
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,100
Who's the person from the police station last time?

126
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,260
The person I like.

127
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,440
Which family and who?

128
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,960
She is only daughter from Joo family.

129
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,700
Even though I can, you can't.

130
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,650
- I can choose anyone I want, but you can't. 
 - What are you talking about?

131
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,190
- Can you introduce her to Mom and Grandma right now?  
 - Yeah.

132
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,210
You're very selfish.

133
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,010
What do you have right now?  Can you show the accomplishments or results of what you want to do?

134
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,430
Are you independent financially?

135
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,550
Your unplanned action would hurt her.

136
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,450
Don't think Mom is an easy person.  She is very stubborn when it comes to her kids' matters.

137
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,570
Especially when it comes to your matters.

138
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,190
Lee Kang Woo!

139
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,670
It's nothing. I came to my senses thanks to you.

140
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,160
You're right. There's no need to console me.

141
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,820
What is he saying? Pick it up.

142
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,270
What?

143
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh.

144
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,220
I'll approve no matter what.

145
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,860
Regardless of what man you choose.

146
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,990
So be on my side as well.

147
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,630
Deal?

148
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,330
Deal.

149
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,090
Assistant Manager, are you waiting for someone's call?

150
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,630
No. Waiting, as if.

151
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,720
I should've taken her to her house that day.

152
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
Ah, did she fall while walking back by any chance?

153
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,840
Her knee was bleeding or something?

154
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,440
Yes, this is Lee Kang Hee.

155
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,410
 - Are you okay?  
 - Pardon?

156
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,480
Mr. Joo Won Jae?

157
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,210
That day... Did you get back well?

158
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,130
 Of course.

159
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,080
I thought otherwise because you didn't call me.

160
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
Did you wait for my call?

161
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,060
No, I didn't exactly wait...

162
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,900
Do you want to eat dinner with me?

163
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,540
Or some other time if you already have an appointment.

164
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,620
I don't have any appointments.

165
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,970
I don't make any appointments since I don't know when you would call me.

166
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,870
I contracted with you, when and where, anytime from 6 p to midnight.

167
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,330
You're a faithful worker.

168
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,130
It was good of me to make that contract.

169
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,640
Of course. You can't find anyone like me anywhere.

170
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,170
I'm very useful.

171
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,730
So... I'll see you later.

172
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,700
Ah, so embarrassing.

173
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,510
How could I prattle on like this?

174
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,010
 I'll see you later, Mr. Joo Won Jae.

175
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,310
 You're very selfish.

176
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,600
 What do you have right now?

177
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,080
 Can you show the accomplishments or results of what you want to do?

178
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,590
Okay!

179
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,310
 Let's meet in the evening. I have something to say—

180
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,120
 Let's meet in the evening. I have something to sa—

181
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,100
Ah, that surprised me.

182
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,580
Who?

183
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,770
Aunt?

184
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,170
Health Teacher's aunt is the mother of Lee Kang Woo.

185
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,830
I didn't even think about it.

186
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,880
 Welcome.

187
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,050
Then I definitely saw you that other time as well.

188
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm so stupid.  Stupid!  Stupid!

189
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,610
But... Why did you come here?

190
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,050
Are you dating Kang Woo?

191
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,850
- Pardon? 
 - Why are you so surprised?

192
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,910
Then... Did you think you would continue to go unnoticed?

193
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,320
I don't need to talk long.

194
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,240
Break up with Kang Woo.

195
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,170
Shinhwa Food's family is not a pushover.

196
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,620
Of course, it must be difficult for you to break up.

197
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,490
That's why I came to make it easy for you.

198
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes. I'll do that.

199
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,420
I'm sorry for causing you an inconvenience.

200
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,860
No, well...

201
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,900
What was that? So easily?

202
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,000
I prepared ten of these.

203
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,210
She didn't even look at them.

204
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,880
Ah, this place is cozier than I thought.

205
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,410
Are you okay?

206
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,300
I saw my aunt here.

207
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,370
Don't worry.

208
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,050
Hyung won't ever give you up.

209
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,200
As long as you don't let go of him first.

210
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,980
That should be the case, right?

211
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,570
As long as I don't let go of him first.

212
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,620
Yes. Hyung won't let go first.

213
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,570
Please don't tell Mi Kyeong.

214
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,310
She'll be sad.

215
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes, don't worry.

216
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,460
Thank you.

217
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,130
I'm always thankful.

218
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,330
What are you going to do if you get caught by Kang Woo, Mother?

219
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,980
- Even if you didn't stop my wife— 
 - Ah, really.

220
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,340
If it were possible, I would.

221
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,670
You heard it from Lawyer Kim too.

222
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,060
Her parents passed away earlier and she has step-siblings.

223
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,160
If Kang Woo finds out, he'll go crazy.

224
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,180
If he gets upset, he will be more dogged than Kang Hee.

225
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,820
So that's why you just need to keep your mouth shut.

226
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,210
Mother, I need to get ready for a meeting so...

227
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,500
- Sit down!  
 - Okay.

228
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,770
Give me your phone.

229
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,510
- What? 
- Until Kang Woo's issue is resolved,

230
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,310
your phone will be confiscated for the time being.

231
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,790
Mother,  I'm working and receiving a lot of phone calls in the business matters.

232
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,560
- What did you say? 
 - Mother, still...

233
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,730
There must be some business calls.

234
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,360
Honey.

235
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,020
What happened?

236
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,820
I'm not sure whether she is shrewd or stupid.

237
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,370
What are you talking about? Did she say she won't ever break up with him?

238
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,270
No!  She said very easily she would break up with him.

239
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,430
No... How many of those did you give her?

240
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,710
- I didn't even give one of them.  
 - What?

241
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,680
Aigoo. Is it because you're the chief director?

242
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,290
It's too soon for you to be off work.

243
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,010
You have nothing different from me.

244
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,040
Your face looks good.

245
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
I worried about you just in case.  But I guess you really don't know anything.

246
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,590
What are you talking about?

247
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,120
If someone is hurting or dying next to you, you won't know anything.

248
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,430
What?

249
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,120
Do you know what doctors have to beware of the most in surgery?

250
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,280
Conceit.

251
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,680
Even if a doctor, who repeated  the same surgery several hundred times, is conceited about his skill, he'll easily make a mistake.

252
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,120
Still, if the doctor admits his mistake and retrieves himself neatly, everything will be fine.

253
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,290
But if he gets stubborn, everything will be complicated.

254
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,750
What do you want to say?

255
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,570
Don't loosen up.

256
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,710
Because if you make one mistake, I won't lose that opportunity.

257
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
Ha! She already got off from work.

258
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,310
She didn't show herself to me all day long.

259
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,180
Hyung, why didn't you come to practice again today?

260
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,730
I made an excuse to the dance instructor saying you were sick but

261
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,280
call me as soon as you hear this.

262
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,730
Who are you? Who are you to come to a stranger's house—

263
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,770
Lee Joo Hee?!

264
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,890
What is with your appearance?

265
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,600
What is it? Don't you have tutoring today?

266
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,640
What? No. Tutor Ho Dol called me.

267
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,620
Second Hyung, did you see Lee Joo Hee just now?  Why does she go around like that?

268
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,600
- What? 
- I mean,

269
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,520
Lee Joo Hee doesn't look like Lee Joo Hee!

270
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,230
What is about Lee Joo Hee looking like Lee Joo Hee?

271
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,750
Are you asking as if you don't know?

272
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,420
Sneakers, pants, and her short hair, but just now she had makeup and a skirt on.

273
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,820
Never mind.

274
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,580
What did he say? The tutor.

275
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,910
What was the reason he said for his not being able to come?

276
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,070
Just that he had a situation. Maybe he's sick?

277
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,480
How stuffy do these friends (cars) feel?

278
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,190
They must be jealous when they see other cars out on the streets through the windows.

279
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,090
Do you feel stuffy at your office too?

280
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,540
I'm hungry.

281
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,240
Come here.

282
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,800
Please have a seat.

283
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,110
These are new, so wear them comfortably.

284
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,050
Thank you.

285
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,710
What did you eat for lunch?

286
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,560
I just ate simply, a glass of milk.

287
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,690
I thought that would be so.

288
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,340
This looks really delicious.

289
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,270
I went to many places while making sales.  This place has the most delicious food like a homemade meal.

290
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,450
Did you buy it on purpose?

291
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,810
Well, I'm assuming other guys have taken you to nice and expensive places.

292
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,780
I just wanted you to eat comfortably.

293
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,340
Here.

294
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,570
Not really.

295
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,780
Are you uncomfortable?

296
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,930
I've been to nice and expensive places

297
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,670
but not with men.

298
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,160
Why? You must've dated many guys.

299
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,310
38.

300
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,620
You met 38 guys...

301
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,870
I mean I haven't properly dated anyone these past 38 years.

302
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,710
I've been to several blind dates,

303
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,050
but I was studying, learning how to work, and going to work.

304
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,680
This really tastes like home food.

305
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,340
♬  Sorry if you got a problem with yourself  ♬

306
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,920
♬  You tryin' to put it on me, I don't need no help  ♬

307
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,690
Hyung! Hyung!

308
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,180
Hyung, Hyung! Did you see this?

309
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,890
♬  Why you tryin' to talk so much? (So much)  ♬

310
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,400
Why are you back? I heard the company told you not to come anymore.

311
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,920
That's ridiculous.  How much money did I earn for them?

312
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,830
I mean, Hyung.  Have you seen this? What an absurd video is up on the internet?

313
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,040
 Then do you want to date me?

314
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,900
♬  Why you tryin' to talk so much?   ♬

315
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,790
 Look at him.

316
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,370
What's this?

317
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,140
I don't know. A dummy unluckily got caught.

318
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,290
 You like it to death?

319
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,150
 Smile, smile.

320
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,320
 Smile so you look better in the video.

321
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,010
 Did you think I was really one of your kind?

322
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,030
Joo Seo Yeon... I'm sure there's something going on.

323
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,160
 Your phone is not connected so it goes to the voice mail...

324
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,720
Look at this! She doesn't answer my calls!

325
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Yes.  I came to the place of the last call.

326
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,370
I'll check a little bit more and call you back.

327
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,650
Excuse me.

328
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,540
Have you seen anyone that looks like this?

329
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,140
No, I haven't.

330
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,060
Okay.

331
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,400
But... Who are you?

332
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,620
I'm a police officer. Then, I will leave now.

333
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,320
What was that? A police officer is looking for Baek Jang Mi?

334
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,290
What's going on in this house?

335
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,030
I'm a crazy b*tch.

336
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,290
It'll be okay if I'm the crazy b*tch. Only me.

337
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,060
I did well, right? I didn't bother you, right?

338
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,290
I only thought of you a little and I got a lot of work done.

339
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,810
I did well, right?

340
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,680
You did well.

341
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,770
Why are you being like this? Did something happen?

342
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,590
Exactly how much is this house?

343
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,860
- What? 
 - Is this house yours?

344
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,340
Well, the house is in my name.

345
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,830
So you're saying that all of this stuff is yours?

346
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,490
Well.

347
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,470
This is the same thing that Elder Oppa has.

348
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,050
He has an eye for choosing clothes.

349
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,050
He bought it with 36 monthly payments and I think he is still paying.

350
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,260
- You bought it with one payment, didn't you? 
 - Yeah.

351
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,120
You really are rich, Lee Kang Woo.

352
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,290
Why are you being like this?

353
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,260
I just realized.

354
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,050
What?

355
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,220
Your place and my place.

356
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,460
- What? 
 - Like a fool, I forgot.

357
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,050
That you are a grandson of Sinhwa Food.

358
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:54,390
Why did I forget that? Don't you think I'm an idiot?

359
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,790
It doesn't make sense–you and me.

360
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,590
Do you know why I don't look like my brothers?

361
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,120
They're not my biological brothers.

362
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,960
As you already know, my parents

363
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,380
passed away.

364
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,550
I'm an orphan.

365
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,970
What are you doing right now?

366
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,290
Do you need more explanation?

367
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,780
I feel like I'm getting pathetic.

368
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,260
Just let's stop when we are in moderation.

369
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,290
In moderation?

370
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:44,340
It's obvious. Even if we keep meeting, I'll be at a loss.

371
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,860
Did you meet me calculating the benefit or loss?

372
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,830
You don't know

373
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,130
because you've never been in a subordinate position.

374
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,710
So Lee Kang Woo, let's break up now–

375
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,840
Joo Seo Yeon!

376
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,130
Why are you being like this, Seo Yeon?

377
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,060
I'm sorry. I did wrong.

378
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,090
Don't do this, Seo Yeon. Hm?

379
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,440
You have a guest!

380
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,900
Who is it?

381
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,550
Pardon?

382
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,840
By any chance, are you Kang Woo's girlfriend?

383
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,720

384
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,380
That's right, my girlfriend.

385
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,880
Why? That's right.

386
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,790
You're my girl.

387
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:12,540
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫ 
 ♫  There is I who only look at you  ♫

388
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,310
♫  Whenever and wherever I'm next to you  ♫

389
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,000
♫  How do you not know?  How do you not know?  ♫

390
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,160
♫  I didn't say anything, but my eyes say  ♫

391
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,750
 Love With Flaws  
 ♫  How don't you notice?  ♫

392
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,560
 Doesn't like you because you're handsome. Doesn't like you because you're ugly. But now she says she doesn't like you because you're a chaebol's grandson?

393
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,760
 Do it moderately.

394
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,750
 You got caught!

395
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,890
 What's your identity?

396
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,330
 I'll protect Unni Seo Yeon.

397
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,520
 If I don't need anything but all I need is just that woman, am I crazy?

398
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,030
 I don't know.  I'm going to get upset now.

399
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,570
 I'll die.

400
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,460
 Don't cry! I told you to stop crying!

401
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,750
 Just play around with me then throw me away.

402
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,780
 Come to your senses, Lee Kang Woo. I think you're crazy.

403
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,480
 Lee Kang Woo is dying with bleeding.

404
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,420
 Why do you give up on me by getting scared beforehand?

405
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,950
 I don't love you.

406
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,500
♫  Would you please notice, my love?  ♫
