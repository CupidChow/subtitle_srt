1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,220
Why won't you sign? By any chance, is it because of what happened before?

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,060
You didn't even confess you liked me because you really liked me!

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,430
You made a bet with our friends to shame me–

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:46,520

5
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,360
Why?

6
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,670
Hey! What are you doing? Let go, you bastard!

7
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,410
Let go, you bastard!

8
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,300
Teacher Joo.

9
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,330
 I'm so humiliated.

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
So Kang Woo— no, Director Lee is your middle school classmate?

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,620
Yes, I got anxious about the track team's matter and came here to resolve it.

12
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,640
But... Why were you kicked out?

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,310
Just now, you were kicked out, right?

14
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,610
By any chance, did you make a mess with his stuff?

15
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,390
Kang Woo— no, Director Lee is a little sensitive to cleanliness.

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,290
Well, he had some beer...

17
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,800
But what are you doing there?

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,430
Lee Min Hyeok!

19
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,690
Hey! What are you doing here at this time? Are you here to see Kang Woo?

20
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,230
How do you know Health Teacher?

21
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,860
Health Teacher?

22
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,140
Oh right! You teach at Shinhwa High!

23
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,640
What is it with you guys?  It's not "Three Families Under One Roof"?

24
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,120
Don't you know "Three Families Under One Roof"?

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,240
Shinhwa High School is for one roof. One family, two families, and three families.

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,180
You should laugh about it for me if you got the gist of it.

27
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,930
So how do you know Health Teacher?

28
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,380
Why wouldn't I know him? Min Hyeok—

29
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,460
It's been a while! He's a hyung I know.

30
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,970
- Yeah, yeah. We're just hyung and dongsaeng but there's– 
 - Wow!

31
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,140
Look how great your skin is.

32
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,890
You must be dating right now.

33
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,800
I got to know Director Lee through Hyeon Soo and yeah...

34
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,990
Yeah, yeah!

35
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,140
Oh, sure.

36
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,060
- Let's go. 
 - Yeah.

37
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,040
Hey.  You still remember what you promised, right?

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,190
Then, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

39
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,650
Yes.

40
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,500
Yeah, but Kang Woo—

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,030
It seems like...

42
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,630
Health Teacher also...

43
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,990
Yeah...

44
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,220
That could b ...

45
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,300
Anyway, what happened? Did you get Lee Kang Woo to sign?

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,630
Joo Seo Yeon came by due to stuff about school. I got that.

47
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,620
Well, while you were talking, you had a drink. I get that. But why are you like this?

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,890
Hey.

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,610
Let's go, let's go. Once he starts, it never ends. It's better to just leave him alone.

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,330
Hyung. If nothing's wrong, then hurry and sign it.

51
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,840
Teacher Joo looked really worried. Okay?

52
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm so humiliated.

53
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,270
Humiliated.

54
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,930
I'm so humiliated!

55
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,420
I'm really so humiliated!

56
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,090
I'm really so humiliated.

57
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,350
Ah, really.

58
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,360
Do you have a cold?

59
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,030
Maybe?

60
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,180
You're always sick around this time.

61
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,060
It's fine.

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,400
Little Oppa...

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,330
Do you feel a reaction when you see women?

64
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,490
Well, what I'm saying is... You're someone that

65
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,990
isn't interested in women physically or mentally, right?

66
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,060
But do you get any physical reactions?

67
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,010
- Why? 
 - Well, just wondering!

68
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
Whether or not, I get stimulated...there are times like that.

69
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,510
Oh, right! I used it well.

70
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,660
What is this?

71
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm sorry! I was in a bind so I just used it!

72
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,460
Not that. Is this about that guy who you mentioned before?

73
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,920
The guy who was pretending not to be gay but hitting on you?

74
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,090
You said something like a physical reaction...

75
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,130
Are you sure he's really gay?

76
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,170
Yeah, he said he was with his own mouth.

77
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,070
There aren't people who would lie about that!

78
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,430
 Who?

79
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,200
 Yeah, you're right! Kang Woo and I have... that kind of relationship.

80
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,160
 Really?

81
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,850
If Kang Woo finds out, will he kill me?

82
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,210
Well, Kang Woo doesn't really have that kind of bias or anything.

83
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,950
To tell the truth, I did it for his own sake.

84
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,070
What am I going to do?

85
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,950
No, no, no, no. It's fine.

86
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,250
It's fine. it's fine. It's fine.

87
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,510
It's not fine!

88
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,330
I'm going crazy.

89
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,110
 The track team's budget proposal 
Teacher-in-charge:  Joo Seo Yeon signed

90
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,340
I just won't look. If I don't look, it'll be fine!

91
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,850
I'll consider that signing this is "taking one step back to go ten steps forward."

92
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,400
Joo Seo Yeon, if you like candy in front of you now,  there will be

93
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,110
a very bitter aftertaste in the end.

94
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,580
What is this? He even dry cleaned this for me?

95
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,600
Lee Kang Woo, you~!

96
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,080
This crazy wrist. This crazy wrist!

97
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,840
 Joo Seo Yeon

98
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,900
What, what, what? What else? I did everything you asked!

99
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,770
I am thankful for that.

100
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,700
We'll make the school's name with our best results for sure.

101
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,640
Thank you so much, Lee Kang Woo.

102
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,180
I mean... Thank you, Chief Director Lee.

103
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:42,080
The happening of yesterday was beyond his control so it'd be better not to mention it, right?

104
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,050
Even if I said anything, we'd both just be uncomfortable.

105
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,020
What's this?  Does she not care about the thing that happened yesterday?

106
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,670
To you, was that just a nonchalant thing?

107
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,840
Am I the only one that is bothered this much?!

108
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,310
 By any chance, is it because of what happened before?

109
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,280
 You didn't confess because you really liked me in the past!

110
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,150
But... What does that mean?

111
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,880
 You made a bet with our friends to shame me–

112
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,960
 What nonsense—

113
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,020
She definitely said something.

114
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,390
Yeah, you shouldn't have hung up like that!

115
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,850
Hello.

116
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,920
 Hello? Son?

117
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,250
Today we're playing a pair dodgeball game. The boys should protect the girls they're paired up with.

118
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,720
Also, the couple that lasts until the end

119
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,850
will get a perfect score on the performance assessment.

120
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,530
- Okay? 
 - Yes!

121
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,620
Giving a perfect score on the performance assessment.

122
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,640
What?

123
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,310
Well, everyone, let's get in position!

124
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,280
Let's go.

125
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,890
Hurry up!

126
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,150
I told you to block it!  Why are you dodging it?

127
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,490
You should catch it and attack them.

128
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,490
 Block it, block it. Block!

129
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,830
Woah!

130
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,310
An idol can't get his face injured!

131
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,530
- Get behind me. 
- What?

132
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,930
I said, get behind me!

133
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,300
♫  At the beach with the endless sea, sun shines in the morning    ♫

134
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,800
♫  Breathing with fresh air, let's run to our hearts' content  ♫

135
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,740
♫  Our big dream that you and I keep in our hearts  ♫

136
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,640
♫  Becoming the best dodgeball player  ♫

137
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,900
♫  The king of dodgeball players!  ♫

138
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,710
You never said that the girl couldn't be the one to protect.

139
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,840
That's right, that's right. Okay!

140
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,470
Lee Joo Hee and Joo Seo Joon, perfect score!

141
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,240
Applause!

142
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,420
What, what?  Good job.

143
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,120
Because of you, I got a perfect score in P.E.

144
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,860
Thanks to you, I'm getting tutoring that I've never dreamed of.  So getting a perfect score is nothing compared to tutoring.

145
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,770
- That was— 
 - I'm not sarcastic.

146
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,780
I said that because I'm really grateful.

147
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,500
I've never been tutored before.

148
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,240
Thanks. Let's do well.

149
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,360
What is this? Why is she acting so cool?

150
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,100
Blind date? At our age? A blind date?

151
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,950
Why are you acting so tacky?

152
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:22,070
We're 30! If we're 30, we definitely should be going on these dates.

153
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,840
Mascara.

154
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,110
Starting Lee Kang Woo, going through Park Hyeon Soo...

155
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,260
How about the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth persons?

156
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,550
Hey, that has already ended at Park Hyeon Soo.  Do you know what he is doing for his living?

157
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,530
He cleans at Seo Joon's company. Cleaning!

158
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,070
This is lip gloss!

159
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,750
What? Oh.

160
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,280
That's enough. Give it to me.

161
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,420
Lee Kang Woo, Park Hyeon Soo, even Teacher Lee Min Hyeok are all in a different league.

162
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,860
Even though I go through the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth persons, they'll probably all be the same.

163
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,520
I really didn't think Teacher Lee Min Hyeok would be the same kind at all.

164
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,870
I always thought that he must've liked you—

165
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,880
Nevermind.

166
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,390
Anyway, my mom set this meeting a month ago.

167
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,630
He has a huge barbecue restaurant in Gangnam.

168
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,940
Of course, if you want to make money, you have to run a  food business.

169
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,420
After all, Shinhwa Food is also a food business.

170
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,170
Do you really have to get married even by going on a blind date?

171
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,520
If you were born human, shouldn't you do everything that other people do before dying?

172
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,430
Don't worry. I'm not saying I'll get married right away either.

173
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,290
Listen to me. Let's go together and you watch me. If I order something with whipped cream, call me in twenty minutes.

174
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,750
- Why? 
 - Would I eat whipped cream messily in front of a guy I like?

175
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,860
If he has any sense, he'll think "oh she doesn't like me."

176
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,090
What if you like him?

177
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,550
Why ask? You should notice it and leave us alone.

178
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,230
Do you think people just go meet up at an expensive hotel coffee shop?

179
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,670
You can get on the elevator right away, then you just...

180
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,900
Hey! It's the first date!

181
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,490
You're going to get yourself in trouble!

182
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,140
Welcome.

183
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,480
Come here, my son.

184
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,590
You've already been here.

185
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,470
You used to say, "Women's being late ten minutes is etiquette."

186
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,400
Well, there are a lot of traffic jams at this time.

187
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,420
By the way, I heard that you don't come to school regularly nowadays.

188
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,630
I'm working well without giving any poor effect on work!

189
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,240
Regardless of the work,  a person has to be earnest.

190
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,020
The more those below you will learn and follow.

191
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,710
People over there don't like it either that a very young guy acts as their boss.

192
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,690
I have to be involved in moderation and be uninvolved in moderation too.

193
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,380
No, no. Let's stay a bit longer.

194
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,050
What is it?

195
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,710
What? W-what are you asking?

196
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,140
Someone else is supposed to come, right?

197
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,760
No way! Who would come?

198
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,550
I'll meet the person, I suppose.

199
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,030
What?

200
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,330
I said I'll meet the person.

201
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,800
You're being serious, right?

202
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,560
If you're being like this, you can't run away later.

203
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,930
Are you always being deceived?

204
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,050
That's right... I haven't dated... Too seldom...

205
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,930
That was why I reacted to a girl like Joo Seo Yeon.

206
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,100
I need to go to the restroom.

207
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,600
You know, right?

208
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,440
Whipped cream. Call you after twenty minutes.

209
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,920
See you later.

210
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,180
 I'm here for a blind date.

211
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,850
Wow, so I guess a lot of people go on these blind dates.

212
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,910
 Shinhwa Food's grandson.

213
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,700
 Yeah, I have to do a good job. I heard he's not the type to come out to these.

214
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,750
 Hang up.  I have to go. Okay.

215
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,810
Was she talking about Lee Kang Woo? Then what about Park Hyeon Soo?

216
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,590
We're right here.

217
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,870
Welcome.

218
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Thanks for coming! Please, sit.

219
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,490
That's really Lee Kang Woo.

220
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,350
Now that I'm seeing you in person, you are so beautiful.

221
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,050
Thank you. He's very handsome.

222
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,340
You think so?

223
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm not saying this because he's my son, but isn't he quite nice?

224
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,340
Wherever we go, they all think he's a celebrity!

225
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,110
Isn't it time for us to leave the two of you alone?

226
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,500
No, please eat dinner with us before you leave.

227
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,370
Oh my! Look how kind her heart is.

228
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,910
No, we should leave.

229
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,770
Let's go, Mother-in-law.

230
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,430
I can take you to your car.

231
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,580
No, it's fine! My two legs are fine.

232
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,760
Let's go.

233
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,930
Take time and have a good time.

234
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,900
Let's go!

235
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,450
They look good together, right?

236
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,740
Is the food not to your taste?

237
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,110
No, it's very delicious.

238
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,060
Then why—

239
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,940
Never mind, please eat.

240
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,740
What's that expression?

241
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,470
Why is he going on a blind date when he has Park Hyeon Soo?

242
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,500
They two like each other so much. So stupid.

243
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,010
Customer?

244
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,900
Is there something you need?

245
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,310
I took the wrong way. I'm sorry.

246
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,440
It seems like you like sweets.

247
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,190
Well, yes. I get rid of my stress with sweets.

248
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,700
Even so, you're maintaining your shape.  Very good.

249
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,570
Where did this girl go?

250
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,290
Until now, I've never gone on the blind dates with someone who is older than 29.

251
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:39,060
30 seems... What should I say? They don't seem like women?

252
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:47,230
But Miss Mi Kyeong, for 30, you have such great skin and your body...

253
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,880
- It seems like you really take care of yourself! 
 - Yes.

254
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,860
A woman who takes care of herself... I like that!

255
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,860
As someone who likes... maintenance, why don't you yourself...

256
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,380
Men are different.

257
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,260
Don't you know the words, men are like wine?

258
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,090
I don't know.

259
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:14,980
As they get older, their taste and fragrance gets deeper.

260
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,900
Just like wine.

261
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,460
What a line!

262
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,840
Why? Is it your first time seeing someone eating?

263
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,650
Very sexy.

264
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,600
I've made a decision.

265
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,930
I will date you, Mi Kyeong.

266
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,160
Wine? What kind of nonsense is that?

267
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,610
Korean people should like Makgeolli (Korean rice wine). Wine? My ass.

268
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,200
If Makgeolli gets too old, it gets sour and nasty, you jerk!

269
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,710
Hey!  Where have you been?

270
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,610
Sorry, sorry, how did it go?

271
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,900
Are you okay?

272
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,490
Whatever. It didn't work. Where were you?

273
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,390
- Lee Kang Woo. 
 - Huh?

274
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,260
Lee Kang Woo was on a blind date.

275
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,260
He looked very sad. Even from my perception, she was a very fine lady, though.

276
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,830
Lee Kang Woo looked like he was having a hard time. Maybe he was forced to go.

277
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,500
Of course.  Do you think that a family like that would just understand him easily? He probably didn't even tell them.

278
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,870
He probably just needs to keep living his entire life, hiding his true self.

279
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,940
Even Park Hyeon Soo begged me never to tell anyone that we know about his relationship with Lee Kang Woo.

280
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,220
He was so adamant about it!

281
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,110
So you too, just ignore it.

282
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,120
Even though they love each other, they can't even say they love each other.

283
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,070
That's so harsh, Lee Kang Woo.

284
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,450
 What? What didn't you like about her?

285
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,430
That person is too perfect but I have a lot to think about.

286
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,750
 Thoughts? What thoughts?

287
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,320
Let's talk again later Madam Oh, I'm driving.

288
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,120
- Go in 
 -  Hey, hey!

289
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,000
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

290
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,170
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

291
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,180
I'm going crazy, really.

292
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,840
♫  Why does my heart keeps trembling whenever I look at you?  ♫

293
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,700
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop whenever I look at you  ♫

294
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,370
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

295
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,590
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

296
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,340
♫  Why does my heart keeps trembling  ♫

297
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,300
- I must really be crazy. 
♫  When I look at you?  ♫

298
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,500
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop whenever I look at you  ♫

299
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,720
What's this? You are real?

300
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,890
Here.

301
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,670
It's because I wanted to say thanks for signing and doing my dry cleaning.

302
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,260
I was on a walk and they were selling them on the street so I bought one.

303
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,860
It's a grass doll. The hair grows out of the head like grass!

304
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,460
Is it so-so?

305
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,950
I thought it looked like you as soon as I saw it.

306
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,530
They also have animal ones, too. If you don't like it, should I go switch it for a different one?

307
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,950
I guess I should have just bought a watermelon or something.

308
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,620
This is really what you don't like, isn't it?

309
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,120
I can bring a watermelon next time!

310
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,850
I want to pick it.

311
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,410
I want to see it myself and pick.

312
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,780
Did the ahjussi already leave?

313
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,590
Just give me, I'll change it to another one next time.

314
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,340
Don't touch my Potato without permission!

315
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,220
What?  You already gave it a name?

316
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,910
Are you okay?

317
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,920
Well, I mean... I was wondering if you had a good day.

318
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,720
That we look alike? I know.

319
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,730
Like middle school Lee Kang Woo!

320
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,870
Back then you were really cute.

321
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,110
When did you grow so much?

322
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,260
When did you grow so much, Lee Kang Woo?

323
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,080
 Okay! I'm stamping  with my thumb.

324
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,060
You really grew a lot, Lee Kang Woo.

325
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,310
Since when?

326
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,100
 Since when did you...

327
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,450
 mean so much to me? Joo Seo Yeon.

328
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,060
What?

329
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,300
Let's go.
