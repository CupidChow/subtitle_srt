1
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,660
 Episode 5

2
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,510
Chief Director!

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,100

4
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,390
I'll introduce myself for the first time.

5
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,430
I'm Chief Director Lee Kang Woo.

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,360
 What the!

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,480
 What are you staring at?

8
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,810
 Should I poke in your eyes?

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,420
 No!  With that state of mind,  you'll have your stomach rumble more, instead of doing revenge.

10
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,400
 Stomach rumble...

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,730
 Do you want to live in fear of when and where your poop will burst out forever?

12
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,660
 My poop bursts out?

13
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,300
 No, I don't want to.

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,560
 I can't hear you.

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,520
  No!

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,670
 Let's try again.  Don't avert your eyes from her eyes no matter what the situation is.

17
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,130
 Well, by the way, this treatment is really used by NASA as well?

18
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,570
 Don't you trust me right now?

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,120
 It's not that I don't trust you.

20
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,430
 What?  Is there something wrong?

21
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,040
 Role—

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,080
 Role-playing is the most basic process in psychotherapy.

23
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,300
 Stanford University 
 Doctor of Psychology 
 Clinical Psychology

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,930
 Okay.

25
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,640
 Let's start again.

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,460
 Never avert your eyes first.

27
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,550
Chief Director,  what are you looking at?

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,350
Chief Director?

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,500
Is there anything more you'd like to say?

30
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,470
Oh, okay, okay.

31
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,030
I think he has something prepared. He is going to read that.

32
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,080
 This is a very potent antidiarrheal imported from Italy.   Please take this medicine in an emergency,

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,060
 in the situation when you can't even move one step.

34
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,770
Our chief director...

35
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,520
I think he must not be a very taciturn person.

36
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,270
Everybody knows we'll have a welcome party for our chief director after work, right?

37
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,660
I understand everybody will be there.

38
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,640
Yes.

39
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,970
Vice Principal! Vice Principal!

40
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,630
Role-playing or something didn't work for me.

41
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,080
It's impossible.

42
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,200
I'm telling you it's possible.

43
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,500
We should've used the actual target person or a picture of the person.

44
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,270
I think we used a drawing so it didn't work well.

45
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,230
Take a picture of her and keep controlling your mind with it.

46
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,960
Where can I get a picture of her all of a sudden?

47
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,430
Didn't you say you were working at the same place?

48
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,270
Are you telling me to take a picture of her with a hidden camera?

49
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,170
If it bothers you, you can take a picture of other people putting her in the background.

50
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,520
You're sure this method is used at NASA, right?

51
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,970
My noodles got soggy.

52
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,540
Ah, ah. I did knock before coming in.

53
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,990
Yes. What is the matter?

54
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,610
I would like to take you on a guided tour of school.

55
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,580
After 10 minutes— , 30 minutes, let's do it.

56
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,520
Ah yes.  I'll be back later.  Then I'll take the flower pot...

57
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,710
Never mind. 30 minutes later.

58
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,060
Please just leave it.

59
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,370
Why did he take mine without my permission?

60
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,470
He just dug the stones and ate a stone, right?

61
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,610
That's right.

62
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,660
What lunatic behavior is this?

63
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,900
By the way, how is he related to Shinhwa Food?

64
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,750
Related?  I think he is around a spoiled last sibling of in-laws of the fourth cousin of the second cousin of Shinhwa.

65
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,000
If he were direct blood of the CEO, he should've gone to the main office.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,950
What benefit would he gain from working here?

67
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,530
I think he will just kill time here and won't be here for long.

68
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,690
- He said we would come back to him in 30 minutes, right? 
 - Yes.

69
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,700
Watch what I'm going to do.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,350
Ah nice weather!  It's nice weather for ditching classes!

71
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,830
- Ah.  We should've come sooner. 
 - What a waste.

72
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,970
- Go! 
 - Let's go.  Let's go and study.

73
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,630
It's just nice weather for studying.

74
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,700
How could Butt Hole be a chief director?

75
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,430
Can anybody be a chief director?

76
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,240
Perhaps... Is he related to Shinhwa Food?

77
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,930
Whatever the case may be, do you think it makes sense that he is a chief director in this sacred school?

78
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,260
We should reveal his rubbish behavior to us and make him resign right away.

79
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,280
Are you crazy?  What if he is really a family member of Shinhwa Food?

80
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,410
He won't be the one to resign but we'll be the ones to get kicked out.

81
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,240
Wow, Kim Mi Kyeong. I never took you for that type of person, but you are.

82
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,180
What did we do wrong?  So why are we scared?

83
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,090
Who on earth is Lee Kang Woo?

84
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,800
- Shut it.  I don't have the headspace to think. 
 - Yeah.

85
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,590
Why isn't he picking up?

86
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,620
- Whom? 
 - Park Hyeon Soo.

87
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,630
If they're really dating as you said, he must know what Lee Kang Woo did.

88
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,890
Still... You should not act as you would know about their dating.

89
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,230
What do you take me for?

90
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,810
 The number you called can't be reached so you're connected to the voice mail...  
 Ah, really!

91
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,690
What's wrong?

92
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,270
I clearly told him we would have to be there by 9 am.

93
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,990
But he didn't pick up the phone nor responded to the doorbell ringing.

94
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,420
Ah, that punk, really.

95
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,120
That's why I need to know the door passcode.

96
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,610
I know privacy is important but a situation like this is killing me.

97
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,810
I'll bring him out.  You tell staff at the site he is going to be a little late.

98
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,620
Why aren't you telling me his passcode?

99
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,540
You asked me why I didn't tell you the passcode?

100
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,890
I was afraid it'd look like this.

101
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,290
Like this...

102
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,200
He ditched a shoot worth 400 million won.

103
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,930
But he is flaunting himself.

104
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,090
You punk!

105
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,800
Who are...?

106
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,680
Who are you?

107
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,700
Why do I?

108
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,020
Hyung, you're here?

109
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,050
I'm leaving.

110
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,930
Okay, bye.

111
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,740
Hey, who is he? It's hard to find someone with that figure. Who is his agency?

112
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,020
He doesn't have an agency?  No way.

113
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,960
Tell me, you bastard!

114
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,930
You're the one who told me to stop blabbing my mouth!

115
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,380
I meant outside!

116
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,540
Oh yeah, the filming!

117
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,850
What are you talking about?

118
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,090
Did you hear or not that you were supposed to be there by 9 am for a razor advertisement shooting?

119
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,090
Oh no!  I'm dead meat.

120
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,770
That idiot.

121
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,120
 What is Lee Kang Woo's relationship with Sinhwa Food?

122
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,540
What is this supposed to mean?

123
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,000
She didn't eat any of them. What a waste.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,710
Ahjumma.

125
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,160
You scared me!

126
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,610
Where's my mask?

127
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,270
That? There was a stain so I threw it out.

128
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,680
What is she doing? Is she crazy?

129
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,470
- How pitiful she is. 
 - It's disgusting.

130
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,300
You must be quite hungry.

131
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,540
Take even this.

132
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,840
What should I do? I left my bag at home.

133
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,020
I'll definitely repay you next time.

134
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,990
I found it!

135
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,570
I'm telling you.  This way, please.

136
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,060
But, where is the principal? I don't think I've seen him.

137
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,660
Oh! How should I put it? Our president is like air.

138
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,900
You can't see him, but he surely exists.

139
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,870
So he's being paid without doing work? Really?

140
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,360
No, no! That's not what I mean!

141
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,980
So, we definitely need him like we need air, but we can't really see him.

142
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,540
So, that doesn't mean he's not doing work.

143
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,900
- It just seems like he's not here but he is actually everywhere—what's the word for this? 
 - Fine dust...

144
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,000
Like fine dust—

145
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,100
I see. Thank you. I'll figure out myself gradually.

146
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,590
I'm going to evaluate every staff membe, regardless of rank or position, soon.

147
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,480
Oh! You might not know this, but the principal is untouchable.

148
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,820
He was actually pretty close with the Sinhwa Foods CEO in the past—

149
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,020
Oh, yes, yes.  It's a groundless rumor.  He was talking about a rumor.  Follow me.

150
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,030
- What— 
 - Shut up!

151
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:29,280
Really? If he went to work on time, it's a relief for now.

152
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,120
He has potential but no manners.

153
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,340
Mother-in-law, you have such a way with words.

154
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:41,120
Teach him well so he'll grow into a good person. Okay.

155
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,320
- Was he the principal? 
 - Yeah.

156
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,430
Mother-in-law, what do you think about this lady?

157
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,850
Her eyes and nose make her look really pretty.

158
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,470
What's so good about a pretty face?

159
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,000
Someone like Kang Woo needs someone who's smart

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,290
and doesn't put up with any nonsense.

161
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,620
Mother-in-law, why did you allow me to marry your son?

162
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,120
You were rich.

163
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,210
It was because of my money?

164
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,090
Well, having money is also a strength.

165
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,770
These girls can't even compare to me when I was young.

166
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,700
If you look from here, the view is quite nice and open!

167
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,210
We didn't use tiles to build the wall. We used marble.

168
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:37,270
Well, as for the grass on our stadium, they gave me a really high quote, but I said no to that. So—

169
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,310
Ugh, these kids. I always clean up after them.

170
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,360
- Chief! 
 - Yes?

171
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,050
What is this? Figure out who dropped this.

172
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,430
Get right on your landing position!

173
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,170
- We have a track &amp; field team, don't we? 
 - Ah, yes.

174
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,720
How is the team?

175
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,860
Well, it is the team the principal has a lot of interest in.

176
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,690
- So far, there's not much to— 
 - If there's no achievement yet, there's no point in keeping it.

177
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,660
School is not a charity organization.

178
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,190
 Take that woman's picture and keep using it for mind control.

179
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,790
- The school is quite beautiful. 
 - Ah, yes!

180
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,270
Stand over there.  I'll take a picture for you.

181
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,640
- Sorry? 
 - You stand together over there.

182
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,550
O-oh, shall we?

183
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,480
- A picture out of the blue— 
 - He said to stand!

184
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,440
Ready... One, two, three!

185
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,270
Here.

186
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,260
One, two, three!

187
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,350
One, two, three!

188
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,470
Here. One, two, three!

189
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,680
Ah really.  It's fun.

190
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,610
Here, here.

191
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,640
One, two, three!

192
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,960
 I think I blinked!

193
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,890
How do they look? Did we come out alright?

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,430
Let's end the tour here.

195
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,050
Why did he take pictures if he wasn't going to show them to us?

196
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,160
Right?

197
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,780
How dare you ask a chief director to come to your office?

198
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,880
Have a seat.

199
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,680
Wow, acting assertive.

200
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,980
Are you okay? Why did you run off without finishing saying hi before?

201
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,600
Well, there wasn't anything I had to say.

202
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,290
Was there something bothering you?

203
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,130
Your mysophobia.  Are you getting treatment for it?

204
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,190
How old were you when you watched your first adult film?

205
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,010
When? Where? With who?

206
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,620
I was in fourth grade with my friend at my friend's house.

207
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,680
Fourth grade? I didn't see you that way.

208
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,420
Don't worry about me and focus on yourself.

209
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,390
Are you even considered human if you can't lie?

210
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,520
You called me here to ask that?

211
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,970
Soon, it's going to be known that you're the grandma's grandson.

212
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So what?

213
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,200
It might not matter to you, but it matters to me. I wish they wouldn't know about me.

214
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,060
You want me to keep it confidential that you're one of the school foundation's family members?

215
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,780
Yes.  Please, Hyung.

216
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,350
Well, there's no reason for me to talk about you.

217
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,310
But, why did you come here out of all companies? You were not interested in school.

218
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,750
Did I steal your position?

219
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,970
No, I was just curious. Why here?

220
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,160
I won't be here long.

221
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,790
 Expected Budge Track &amp; Field Team for Preparing Junior National Meet in 2019

222
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,800
This is just how she lives her life,

223
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,290
but she tells me to what? Go poop?

224
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,730
I'm going to look her straight in the eyes and yell, "You're fired!" I am.

225
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,340
What the heck? Did she know I was taking a picture of her?

226
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,200
No way.

227
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,670
Hey! Lee K—

228
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,810
What was that?

229
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,270
 Meeting the most notable female in 2019, Lee Kang Hee, Director of Sinhwa Food

230
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,860
One son and one daughter. Lee Kang Hee and Lee Kang Woo.  You can understand the situation, right?

231
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,930
So, what you're saying is that Lee Kang Woo is the grandson of Sinhwa Food?

232
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,520
Yeah. The third-generation chaebol we've only heard of.

233
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,460
Ugh. If only I'd known earlier.

234
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,970
What if you had known?  Were you going to be a sacrificial lamb in the fake wedding?

235
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,400
Honestly, maybe.

236
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,240
I think it might be worth risking it if I were to become a chaebol's daughter-in-law.

237
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,040
- Get a grip! 
 - You startled me. I'm just thinking about it!

238
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,940
I can't even think about it with my own head?

239
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,370
Anyway, if we think of how much he played us, I want to destroy him. But what can we do?

240
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,510
He's the chief director and could be the heir.

241
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,790
Well, so what? Do you think I'll leave him alone because of something like this?

242
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,320
Your words and actions are very different, right now.

243
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,140
W-what's different? Who cares if he's a chief director? What if he's an heir?

244
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,220
Of course, that's everything. It's so obvious.  You're a contract worker.

245
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,840
And also you said the chief director would have to approve the budget for track competition.

246
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,780
Butt Hole holds your lifeline, right now.

247
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,410
If he strangles you with it somehow,

248
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,960
you'll be dead.

249
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,270
My point is, try not to run into him.

250
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,600
Pretend like you don't know him. Like you don't exist by not standing out.   It's not that hard.

251
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,740
 Company Motto: Diligence over Success

252
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,060
Let's go. It's time for the meeting.

253
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,650
Do I have to attend?

254
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,610
You can skip all other meetings but you promised to attend the board meetings.

255
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,770
Why do we pay them so much money?  We pay them because they can take care of things on their own without me.

256
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,970
And I'm busy right now. I have so many overdue reports to fill.

257
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,730
Let's go. Fine. Who said I wouldn't go?

258
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,630
I really don't want to work.

259
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,990
Take this position quickly so I can take a rest.

260
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,120
Try to persuade the chairwoman.  She said she wouldn't let me before I marry.

261
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,520
I really don't want to go.  I really don't want to work.

262
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,820
- Father! 
 - What? What? What?

263
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,710
They want to show off so desperately that they're working?  Why do they have to hold a meeting?

264
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,240
You're a company representative.  You have to know what's going on at the company at least.

265
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,670
I just can read their reports.  Why do they must hold a meeting?

266
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,390
Why do they hold a meeting when I can just read the reports?

267
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,620
I'm going to marry a workaholic for sure.

268
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,030
♬  I'm only one call away  ♬

269
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,390

270
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,970

271
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:49,090
♬  I'm only one call away  ♬

272
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,640
Is he asleep?

273
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,020
That punk.  I won't leave him alone today—

274
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,740
Oh, no.  Wait.

275
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,270
A car model.  A car model!

276
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,170
Hey,  let's give him something to make him look even better.

277
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,140
♬  Where you go  ♬

278

00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,290
Hey, bring this to him.

280
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,040
♬  I'll be  ♬

281
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,040
Are you awake?  You can sleep more.

282
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,030
Why did you wake him up, punk?  Why did you wake up?  Go back to sleep.  Put the sunglasses on.

283
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,990
Hello.

284
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,250
Thanks to you, we've sold three of this car.

285
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,060
Hello.

286
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,640
 Meeting the most notable female in 2019, Lee Kang Hee, Director of Sinhwa Food

287
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,690
 What are you doing? I told you to park my car.

288
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,190
Sinhwa Food?

289
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,940
 Meeting the most notable female in 2019, Lee Kang Hee, Director of Sinhwa Food

290
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,930
She deserved being arrogant.

291
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,970
 Sinhwa Bakery's premium ice cream, Sinhwa Tripe, best grilled tripe

292
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,390
Is this place also Sinhwa Food's?

293
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,500
The food in this place is really very good.

294
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,640
Wouldn't it be better for me to befriend Lee Kang Woo?

295
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,300
It's really miserable.  Miserable.

296
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,860
Joo Seo Yeon, your life is really miserable.

297
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,850
My bread.

298
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,460
You put it there, Health Teacher!

299
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,810
What a lunati—

300
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,540
Oh my!

301
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,220
This is made by Sinhwa Food?

302
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,850
Ah, it's so good!

303
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,110
It's so good.

304
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,620
Are you looking for your wallet?

305
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,360
Yes.  Have you seen it?

306
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,850
I think I left it here yesterday.

307
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,250
You must be happy to be so popular.

308
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,060
 It sounds exciting.

309
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,490
 Our life.  Let's go.

310
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,670
- Wait!  I-I left something. 
- What did you?

311
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,790
He always leaves something.

312
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,620
- You said we're going to meet the girls from the department of dance? 
 - Yeah.

313
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,470
Why are we taking Ho Dol?  He doesn't make us look great.

314
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,580
He's our underdog.  We need someone who's worse looking.

315
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,220
Anyway, how did you convince him?

316
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,440
He never comes to a blind date.

317
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,660
I told him to eat as much as he wants without paying.

318
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,110
I kept you waiting for a long, didn't I?  I'm sorry.

319
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,930
-  Let's go. 
 -  Let's go.

320
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,630
Wait for me.

321
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,510
I really didn't expect you would come all the way here.

322
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,350
It's so annoying.

323
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,850
If I didn't do like this, you wouldn't see me.

324
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,100
Give it to me.  I told you to give it to me.

325
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:50,030
Excuse me.  I'm attending Han Gook University.  This is the best university in Korea.

326
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,370
So what?

327
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,190
I'm young, handsome,

328
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,910
and smart.  Why you don't want to date me?

329
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,730
What do you not like about me?  Tell me so I'll fix it.

330
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,540
I told you to tell me...

331
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,090
You can't handle it, right?

332
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,650
A guy who can't handle himself is annoying.

333
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,740
- Did you order chicken? 
  - Huh?

334
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,280
It's not a delivery woman?

335
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,640
Go faster! Faster!  You became slower.

336
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,220
Knees up!

337
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,160
Why did you bring him?

338
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,310
- Noona! 
- It's Teacher!  What again?

339
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,900
- I have to sit with her now. 
 - So what?

340
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,720
I mean, I live with her at home.  Now I have to sit with her together even at school?

341
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
What one earth are you worried about?

342
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,660
It's so obvious that she'll end up liking me.

343
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,070
How can I live with a stalking fan under the same roof?

344
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,930
- Go!  Don't you go!  
 - Ah, seriously.

345
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,690
- Seriously. 
 - Wait and see.

346
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,630
You'll regret ignoring what I said.

347
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,690
Seriously, you.

348
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,530
I should've raised him better.

349
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,400
How did you end up sitting together?  You should've avoided this well.

350
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,890
We drew lots, so I had no other choice.

351
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,070
 Don't look at me.

352
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,550
 I told you to not look at me.

353
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,450
 I said, "Don't look at me!"

354
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,710
 Don't cross over the line.

355
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,120
 I'll kill you if you tattle on me to Noona!!

356
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,010
 By chance, do you like me?

357
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,740
 Even though you like me, don't like me!!!

358
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,090
 Otherwise, you'll be dead!!!

359
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,750
 So clingy.

360
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,400
Teacher, have you ever received 30 messages within a minute?

361
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,740
We weren't even friends on the messenger either.

362
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,100
I'm sorry.  I'll have another talk with him.

363
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,250
Please bear it just a little longer.

364
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,240
I don't mind.  He'll stop eventually.

365
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,730
I have less than a month to the track meet, so I have no time to be concerned.

366
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,770
Of course, the track meet is very important.

367
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:47,090
Of course. The chief director will give approval of the budget very soon.  Way to go!

368
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,270
This is driving me crazy.

369
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,610
It's not like he wouldn't sign the approval because of personal grudges, right?

370
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,610
Hello.
