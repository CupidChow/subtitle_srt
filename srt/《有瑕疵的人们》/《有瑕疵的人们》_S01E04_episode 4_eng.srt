1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,080
There's nowhere else that pays this well. How can you just make me quit because you want me to?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,810
Doesn't the wine bar pay you more than this place, anyway?

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,660
You're doing so well, a high school student working at a bar.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,890
That bar isn't the place that you think.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,850
What did you do so well to talk back to me?

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,670
You're quitting track? You're not going to college?

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,820
If I do track, can I eat and live off of it?

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,390
Look at me! I did track, and I became a teacher who makes money.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,710
And I got fame, too.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,920
Winning a silver medal in the national meet was getting fame?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey!  That is not easy!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,280
Be honest. If you don't do track, do you have anything else to do?

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,180
Do you have a clear goal?

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,990
So, do what you're best at and run track for now.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,160
You like running.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,540
Just because people like something, it doesn't mean they can live off of it.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,590
Everyone has their own situation.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,270
What happened to your house? And your older sister?

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,960
After getting crazy over a guy, she ran away with all the savings.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,850
- Why didn't you tell me? 
 - Because it was embarrassing.

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,460
You have so many things that are embarrassing.

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,340
Where did you live all this time? Where's your stuff?

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,460
At the sauna.

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,880
Let's go.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,860
Really? Seo Joon and you both really don't listen to me at all.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,560
Are you going through your sophomore puberty?

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,100
I'm going!

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,160
Are you eating well?

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,580
Here. This is a room we don't use, so use it without feeling guilty.

30
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,160
It's like the room from "Anne of Green Gables."

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,270
I said the same thing when I was younger.

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,430
You stayed at this house since you were younger?

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,840
Yeah, ever since I was eleven years old.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,750
Your whole family?

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,180
Then do you still live with your parents?

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,600
They died when I was in middle school.

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,580
Is that why you look after me? Because I'm like you?

38
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,050
No, it's because you run well.

39
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,560
If you hadn't been able to run, I wouldn't even have had this much care for you.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,060
You don't have that much going for you. You can fix up the room however you'd like.

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,600
I'll let Seo Joon know that only you and I will use the bathroom on the second floor from now on.

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,640
But Joo Seo Joon will probably not like that I'm staying here.

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,420
If he doesn't like it, he can leave.

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,610
Also, besides Seo Joon, I have two older brothers, but they rarely come to the second floor, so you don't need to mind them.

45
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,670
I'm sure you're tired. Rest up.

46
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,350
Teacher!

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,520
Thank you.

48
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,410
You must not be understanding the situation.

49
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,310
Living under the same roof as me means that you should always be ready for training.

50
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,090
Your life is in my hands, okay?

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,170
That's why I'm more thankful.

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,060
My student will be staying in the unused room on the second floor.

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,100
Please know that. Is there anyone who wants to eat dinner at the house?

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,440
Will their fingers break if they type a response?

55
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,000
I've never seen them reply to me, not once!

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
These kids.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,370
Joo Seo Yeon? Who is Joo Seo Yeon again?

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
Why don't you know? How can you not know Joo Seo Yeon?

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,650
I don't go out to middle school reunions a lot.

60
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,180
You don't remember Joo Seo Yeon from middle school?

61
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,910
Was she pretty? That's strange because I remember all the pretty kids.

62
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,740
Here.

63
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,780
Why did you go as far as to draw a picture?

64
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,780
It makes sense that I don't remember her!  This is Kim Mi Kyeong's friend.

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,310
Kim Mi Kyeong?

66
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,050
Yeah, I have met with her before but she's that clingy type.

67
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,130
Make some space.

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,520
Do you like her? Is this type of face your style?

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
Would that be so?

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,230
That's right. It's not, right? But why then?

71
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,390
I have something to settle. Can it be done right away?

72
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,670
I can do it within five minutes.

73
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,430
Are you done?

74
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,040
The only guy worth anything in our class! He's the guy I talked about last, Park Hyeon Soo!

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,210
I don't know.

76
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,880
Anyway, I got a message from him, and he wants to see me right away.

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,010
Good for you.

78
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,110
 With you, too!

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,930
What?!

80
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,260
He wants me to come out with a friend. What do you think that means?

81
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,200
It means that another man is coming out as well.

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,370
 Then I don't like it more.

83
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,200
Just keep me company.

84
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,700
Take someone else!

85
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,920
I can't trust anyone else!

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,570
Do you really need to go that far?

87
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,260
If you really don't want to, then fine.

88
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,860
But I think I'm going to drink all the alcohol he'll give me.

89
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,400
But as you know, three glasses are my limit, right?

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,470
 If he took me away somewhere, I would probably just follow him, right?

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,610
Then the next morning, I'll call you in tears.

92
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,090
Seo Yeon, last night, with that guy, I—

93
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,570
So, where do we meet?

94
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,140
I'll send the address.

95
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,640
♫  You must remember me  ♫

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,380
Are you sure it's here?

97
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,410
Yeah. After looking into this place at the internet, I found out that it's a very expensive place.

98
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,620
How do I look? Do I look like I tried too hard?

99
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,590
It has to look natural, though.

100
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,340
You look pretty, you look pretty.

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,770
Just a moment. I prepared this so we would look good together.

102
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm here to send you home safely.

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,710
It's better if it works out for the both of us.

104
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,040
Ah, really.

105
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,050
If you drink three glasses of alcohol, we're going to leave right away.

106
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,470
Okay, okay.

107
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,620
All my weapons are equipped.  (I'm ready.)

108
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,410
Take a pious attitude. Take a pious attitude.

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,530
Nice to meet you.

110
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,580
Kim Mi Kyeong, Joo Seo Yeon?

111
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,070
Do you know me?

112
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,340
Of course, we went to the same school.  Take a seat.

113
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,640
Why didn't you contact me after seeing me?

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,010
I waited for your message, why didn't you contact me?

115
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,270
You're not bad. Responding to a question with another question.

116
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,050
Oh, is that so?

117
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,760
- I ordered what I like.  Is that all right? 
 - Yup.

118
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,140
I'll drink it well.

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,460
But why did you contact us so suddenly?

120
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,770
I remembered I didn't go to the reunion.

121
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,950
I thought I would've been able to see you at the reunion. So I called you.

122
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,030
That's right. You know Lee Kang Woo, right?

123
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,770
Butt hole. He was there.

124
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,180
That fat kid became a completely different person. He became unbelievably cool.

125
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,980
Oh, really? What did everyone else say?

126
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,730
Everyone else was going crazy, of course.

127
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,430
If I had to pick which celebrity he resembled–

128
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,310
I'm telling you, he's a conman.

129
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,580
A conman?

130
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,820
He showed up all of sudden and left abruptly.   He probably didn't pay his dues either.

131
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,420
I didn't know we had to pay our dues.

132
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,650
Lee Kang Woo? How are you here?

133
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,510
I stayed in contact with him.

134
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,040
We meet again.

135
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,860
I know, right.

136
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,730
I'm sorry I left like that.

137
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,440
Why are you sorry? It's not like we made plans to meet.

138
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,110
But were you sick anywhere?

139
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,060
Yeah, something urgent suddenly came up.

140
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,500
But you left too slowly for it to be an urgent matter...

141
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,390
- It looked like you needed to poop— 
 - By the way!

142
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,890
What are you two doing for a living?

143
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,200
Guess. What do you think?

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,110
At this level of beauty... Stewardess?

145
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,000
That's not bad. What do you do?

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,810
Just this and that.

147
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,420
If you have a lot of secrets, you're a bad man, though.

148
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,100
Do you have anything to say?

149
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,840
It seems they're having a good time.  Shall we have a drink somewhere else?

150
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,320
 Can you resist not following me?

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,570
I don't know...  Do we have to?

152
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,470
 What?

153
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,200
What?

154
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm going to leave for a bit.

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,920
Let's be sure to go home together.

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,900
Shall we? Okay.

157
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,630
 I knew it.

158
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,050
 What's with his gaze?  It looks like a rotten fish gaze. It's so dull.

159
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,270
 How about me? You're chomping at the bit to fall for me, right? Going crazy, right?

160
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,950
 Is that a man's face?  You can cut fish with that chin.

161
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,800
 It's not crafted pottery.  How can it be so sharp?

162
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,470
 You're going insane, right? You like me so much that you're going crazy, right?

163
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,330
 How are his limbs so long?  And how is his head so small?

164
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,390
 Anyway, it's the worst. The worst!

165
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,750
 Your head is filled with me.

166
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,520
 How hard you shake your head, you can't get rid of me from your head.

167
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,720
 You're already done for.

168
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,870
What do you do for a living?

169
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,800
Well, I just make money enough to live.

170
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,750
Do you have someone you're dating?

171
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,560
Why are you curious about that?

172
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,710
I... am interested in you.

173
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,240
- What? 
 - That's why I asked Hyeon Soo to do this.

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,110
I asked for a space to meet with you.

175
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,540
Not because of Mi Kyeong?

176
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,650
Just as you said, you were my first love.

177
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,130
After you rejected my love last time...

178
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,650
That...

179
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,040
I'll say it first.

180
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,220
After you rejected my love, I sobered up.

181
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,710
I vowed to transform myself into someone amazing and befitting of you.

182
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,910
It took fifteen long years,

183
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,770
but how am I? Are you going to accept my confession?

184
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,690
Joo Seo Yeon, do you want to date me?

185
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,540
You... Are you sick anywhere?

186
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,240
What?

187
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,970
You were so sick,  you received treatment in the United States for fifteen years?

188
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,810
What?

189
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,350
You're not a crazy guy, and yet you suddenly say this after fifteen years?

190
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,930
You're going to say those things to a girl you don't even know?!

191
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,740
Crazy guy?!

192
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,350
Hey! Stop saying those insane things and go poop!

193
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,360
Poop?! Hey, why would I poop?

194
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,300
Have you helped me on my pooping?

195
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,120
Whether or not I poop, why does it matter to you? Why does it matter to you?

196
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,850
I don't need to poop, you know!

197
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,470
Dammit...

198
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,700
Why? Why?

199
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,160
Why are we acting like this?

200
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,880
You better not meet those guys again. Don't even pick up their calls!

201
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,240
Why?

202
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,830
Do you know what Lee Kang Woo said? He said for me to date him.

203
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,660
What?

204
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,390
How foolishly do you think he thought of me to say stuff like that?

205
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,520
Did Park Hyeon Soo not say anything?

206
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,890
No, not really. But strangely enough, he didn't tell me about his job.

207
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,780
He cleverly kept beating around the bush.

208
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,090
So I didn't tell him either.

209
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,190
Look at that. They're both weird.

210
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,680
They must have gone crazy.

211
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,130
I had my suspicions based on their looks. Sure enough, guys act just how they look.

212
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,320
Man, I thought I met someone nice this time.

213
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,970
- That's enough. Let's eat some Soup Rice. 
 - It sounds good.

214
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,270
Hey, who would ask a woman to date him abruptly even if so?

215
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,970
You just show so obviously that you didn't have any experience in dating.

216
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,980
Why? What am I lacking?

217
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,560
If a man like me had asked her out, she should've been grateful.

218
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
What?  Go poop?!

219
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,770
But it is strange.

220
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,920
It's not that easy to say no in front of your face.

221
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,910
In the worst case,

222
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,300
she would say she'd think about it.

223
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,570
Joo Seo Yeon, in your eyes, I'm still lacking, right?

224
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,970
Just what? What is lacking?

225
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm perfect! This face, this body!

226
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,040
That's right, that's it!

227
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,330
Wealth.

228
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,680
- What? 
 - It's money.

229
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,140
Kim Mi Kyeong told me earlier that you didn't bring your own car to the class reunion.

230
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,110
She asked why you, looking rich, didn't have your own car.

231
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,470
It's really so ludicrous.

232
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,570
People judge other's wealth based on cars.

233
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,510
Anyway, you can't leave Korea right away because of your grandma.

234
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,950
Go and buy yourself a car tomorrow.

235
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,360
A car?

236
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,680
Yeah. Get a super nice one and try again.

237
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,610
Tell her all you have are good looks and money.

238
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,630
Say, "The only thing that can fill my empty heart is you, Joo Seo Yeon."

239
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,710
Buy her delicious food and something nice.  Just make her crazy for you.

240
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,000
And then!

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,750
And after that?

242
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,690
When she looks the happiest,

243
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,750
when she goes gaga over you, that's when...

244
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,860
You should dump her.

245
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,030
Then it's game over.

246
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,910
Game. Over.

247
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm here.

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,960
What's this? No one's here again!?

249
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,760
Are you kidding me?

250
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,090
Dammit.

251
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,150
Is it okay if they always leave the house empty until late at night when a minor lives here?

252
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,160
Ah, really!

253
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,790
 On the first day of moving into a rented room,

254
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,730
 it happened.

255
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,300
 While I was washing my hair in the bathroom, I looked at the mirror thoughtlessly.

256
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,510
 Some woman was seen there.

257
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,310
 Hunching her back a little bit, through the mirror,

258
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,500
 she was watching me motionlessly.

259
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,050
 Like having a nightmare...

260
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,020
It's a lie, right? Of course, it's a lie!

261
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,700
Ah, what do I do?

262
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,420
Noona, are you here?

263
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,470
Noona?

264
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,150
Oldest brother? Is it the second oldest brother?

265
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,140
N-Noona?

266
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,380
Are you okay?

267
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,650
What if someone at school finds out we live in the same house?

268
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,170
You know the idols can lose their popularity in a moment because of a scandal, right?

269
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,260
If you really don't like it, I'll tell Teacher and leave this house.

270
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,740
That's what you have to do, then!

271
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,890
I'm not going to leave my room so don't feel bothered.

272
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,660
Who said l'd feel bothered?

273
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,640
So frustrating!

274
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,860
What makes him sleep well alone?

275
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,130
Because Joo Hee is here, he felt safe?

276
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,700
Noona!

277
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,560
I decided. Joo Hee will stay here.

278
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,740
Hyung!

279
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,270
After listening to the situation, I feel sorry for her.  Just bear it.

280
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,310
Hyung!

281
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,230
Can I go back to my room and sleep?

282
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,970
Hyungs!

283
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,770
Let's go.

284
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,500
Ah, really!

285
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,540
You know you have to deposit your shared living expense by noon, right?

286
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,810
Noona, what if someone finds out?

287
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,830
Do only the two of you, Joo Hee and you live here?

288
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,250
Why are you overreacting? Also, you seemed to sleep well without us last night!

289
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,500
Th-that–

290
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,490
You slept well because you knew, subconsciously, Joo Hee was here.

291
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,210
See?  She is already helpful.

292
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,720
Stop complaining and get ready to go to school.

293
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,680
Ah, really!

294
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,140
Why are you being like this, really?

295
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,890
You... From now on, I'll consider you as a dog.

296
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,300
A dog that guards house.  You're no more or no less.

297
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,330
Don't act like you know me in school.

298
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,010
Don't even think about taking pictures of me and selling them.

299
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,450
Lunatic.

300
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,750
 Give me some more vegetables.

301
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,350
 - I'll give you mine. 
 - Eat mine.

302
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,500
- I'm okay. 
 - I don't like rice.

303
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,530
Why are you like that? I'll give you some water.

304
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,390
Let's eat somewhere else.

305
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,340
Why are you like this?

306
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,750
I don't know, let's just eat somewhere else!

307
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,110
Why are you being like this? Where are you going?

308
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,090
He is the one making it more obvious.

309
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,100
I told them to send me the living expense but they didn't listen to me.

310
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,710
Fine. I'll go and get it in person.

311
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,040
You have a nice view here.

312
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,420
Do you need anything?

313
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,070
It's strange.

314
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,260
Pardon?

315
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,540
I can't figure out your character.

316
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,820
What are you talking about?

317
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,380
Why did you tattle on Seo Yeon?

318
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,300
Because I saw Teacher Joo Seo Yeon ruining the flowerpot.

319
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,240
Your answer is not what I was asking.

320
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:36,320
School Doctor,  by chance... do you like Seo Yeon?

321
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,570
Nevermind.

322
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,010
Whatever it is, you look more handsome when I look at you closely.

323
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,980
It's more disappointing.

324
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,480
Good day.

325
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:05,170
 Urban Motors

326
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,520
So if you want to keep them just as acquaintances, don't tell them which family you're from.

327
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,390
I don't tell people what I do for a living.

328
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,860
Why?

329
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,910
It's a hassle when people find out about what I do.

330
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,050
It's better just to give them vague answers.

331
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,450
Hey!

332
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,650
Isn't that Joo Seo Yeon?

333
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,410
Why did you wear pajamas to visit me at work?

334
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,430
Wow, is that her boyfriend? He's so handsome!

335
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,830
Because of whom do you think I'm living like this?

336
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,110
Let's talk about it at home.

337
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,950
- Than me? 
 - What?

338
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,750
Is he more handsome than me?

339
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,270
No, he's just handsome with a different style.

340
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,320
Now I understand why Joo Seo Yeon didn't fall for your face.

341
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,190
It's because she has such a handsome boyfriend like him.

342
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,760
Where are you going? Aren't you going to buy a car?

343
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,430
Are you going to walk?

344
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,400
 Easy Transferring 
500,000 won (=~421 USD)

345
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
You're so determined.

346
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,670
You could've just wired me the money on time.

347
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,610
You always make me come down here for this.

348
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,910
Hey, are you satisfied?

349
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,780
Now, I'll see you next month.

350
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,060
♫  Didn't notice 'cause our love was blind  ♫

351
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,790
Is she really your sibling?

352
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,260
Yeah. Why?

353
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,000
She doesn't look like you at all!

354
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
Is she really your sibling?

355
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,060
Yeah, we do look alike!

356
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,620
We look exactly the same.

357
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,700
How did she meet a guy like that?

358
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,460
What's this?

359
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,660
She must be so charming in a way that we don't know.

360
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,950
Charming? Joo Seo Yeon? As if.

361
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,820
I'm sure that guy is just playing with her.

362
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,580
Just like what you're going to do.

363
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,220
Hey, that's—

364
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,550
- Yes? 
 -  CEO, Mr Park Seok Min —

365
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,670
What about Seok Min?

366
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,480
What?

367
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,330
That idiot.

368
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,780
I got it.

369
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,350
What happened?

370
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,650
I told this idiot to be careful for a while.

371
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,310
Why couldn't he hold himself back?

372
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,680
Wait here for a short. I have to see if someone is there.

373
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,450
What's this?

374
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,580
What is that place so only that kind of guys walk in there?

375
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,330
♬  Always be my day one  ♬

376
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,360
♬  Day zero when I was no one  ♬

377
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,280
♬  I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else  ♬

378
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,080
♬  Thankful  ♬

379
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,290
 That's right. Even guys look up at me like this.

380
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,490
 Joo Seo Yeon, you dared to look down on me?

381
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,080
♬  I got lucky  ♬

382
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,170
Oh my, where did Hyeon Soo go anyway?

383
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,100
♬  I won big  ♬

384
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,610
Wait, if you don't send it right away...

385
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,740
I will make a really big scene here.

386
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,780
I'll send it right now.

387
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,020
This is unbelievable.

388
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,690
I told you to wait in the car.

389
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,890
Hey.

390
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Why are you like this?

391
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,610
Do.. Do you need to poop?

392
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,400
Go now.

393
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,870
Did you poop? Did you do it again?

394
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,630
It's not, right? Say it's not, you bastard!

395
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,730
It's okay.  It's okay.

396
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,060
Let's go for now.

397
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,550
Hold it in, bastard. Please hold it in.

398
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,630
What's with those jerks?

399
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,260
They had that kind of relationship?

400
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,960
How could Joo Seo Yeon be with those guys?

401
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,880
Wait. If she can date them, then why not me?

402
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,900
Why, exactly?

403
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,860
What? They were both at your second brother's bar together?

404
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,330
Yes. And it looked like they were in a really deep relationship.

405
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,160
So, have they been playing with us?

406
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,970
I told you: people who look good can't be trusted.

407
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,130
If I see any of them again, I'll break them in half. Huh?

408
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,580
What, what, what?

409
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,670
Excuse me...

410
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,820
It's the teacher!

411
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,080
By any chance, do you not have anywhere to stay?

412
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,100
Pardon?

413
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,060
If you have anyone to call, should I call them for you?

414
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,500
- Or to a shelter... 
 - I'm fine.

415
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,250
Are you really okay?

416
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,410
You're a kind person.

417
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,780
Do you want to have this?

418
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,690
What? No.

419
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,930
You can have it, though.

420
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,100
If you need help in the future...

421
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,510
Why are you acting like this? Ah, really.

422
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,330
If you ever need help, contact me.

423
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,490
 010 2883 2083

424
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,290
What's your name?

425
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,760
Me? Joo Seo Yeon.

426
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm Baek Jang Mi. (White Rose)

427
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,110
Then...

428
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,480
Who is that?

429
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,720
I think she's homeless.

430
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,740
But she's that young?

431
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,340
She must have some situation.

432
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,830
She said she's Baek Jang Mi, right?

433
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,270
That is a name for a psychopathically bad wench in the dramas.

434
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,520
Joo Seo Yeon...

435
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,110
 I don't really like him. Even after eating all that, how can he keep his shape?

436
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,700
Huh? What led you to come here, Hyung?

437
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,340
Well...

438
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,110
I want to see you and other things.

439
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,090
You had such a great career in that huge hospital.

440
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,850
Aren't you suffocated sitting in such a tiny room?

441
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,120
It's not as tiny as you think it is.

442
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,450
Is it comfortable to work in a school?

443
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,740
You can come and go at a set time and you get vacations. It's not bad.

444
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,290
You're saying It's good, right?

445
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:48,710
What? Is this place also on the list?

446
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,060
Well... but I hate kids so I don't think this place—

447
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,360
What's this? Why is she here?

448
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,180
I found out that friend is sitting in my palm.

449
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,170
All I need to do is just to clench my fist lightly like this.

450
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,930
I didn't know I could overcome it easily.

451
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,640
What does that mean?

452
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,100
Instead of overcoming her, I want to seek revenge on her.

453
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,000
I need your attention.

454
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,120
Today, a new chief director, whose position has been

455
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,680
vacant for a while, has finally been appointed.

456
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,880
He is a very competent person who studied at the renowned Stanford University in America.

457
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,510
Everyone, I ask you to applaud.

458
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,490
Chief Director!

459
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,200
I will introduce myself for the first time.

460
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,120
I'm Chief Director Lee Kang Woo.

461
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,830
 F**k.

462
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,240
 I won't leave you alone and I'm going to watch you.

463
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:16,690

464
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,590
 You punk.

465
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:30,320
♫  I came to meet you by chance, and I fell in love with you  ♫

466
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:37,980
♫  I didn't realize that day by day, time was passing  ♫

467
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,480
♫  But are you tired of me or I did something wrong  ♫

468
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,360
 Love With Flaws

469
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,710
 Does it matter if he's the director?

470
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,950
 I'm asking it does matter if he's a heir.

471
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,610
 Right now, that butt hole is holding your lifeline.

472
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,780
 If the track team don't get good results, we don't need to keep them.

473
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,570
 You're asking me to make them not know you're one of this foundation family?

474
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,250
 Teachers, do you want to ride in my car?

475
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,210
 - You punk! 
 - Who is he? Who is his agency?

476
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,480
 Shinwha Food?  She deserved being arrogant.

477
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,590
 Stop right there!  You're holding such an old grudge.

478
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,390
