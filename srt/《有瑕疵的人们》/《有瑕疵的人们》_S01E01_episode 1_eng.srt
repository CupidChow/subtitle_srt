1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,780

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,190
Oh, no.

3
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,800
How could they finish so much stuff in three days?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,370
 Pork belly half-price sale! Now, the delicious pork belly is discounted 50%!

5
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,400
This is karma.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,440
This is my punishment.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,530
Blame who, my karma.

8
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,770
Is it you?

9
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,330
Huh?

10
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,590
Who..?

11
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,560
It was with someone like her?

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,450
Like me?

13
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,930
Hey! You dare to live with my boyfriend?

14
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,190
Which bastard was it this time?

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,280
It's not anything like that!

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,050
She says it's nothing!

17
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,330
Unbelievable.

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,580
Hey! He's my man!

19
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,910
He's mine!

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,380
No, I'm the younger sibling!

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,230
I'm the younger sibling!

22
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,640
Younger sibling?!

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,520
That's right! The younger sister!

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,890
What kind of nonsense is that?

25
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,790
Hey!

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,210
You're his younger sibling?

27
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,690
Like hell!

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,240
Hey!

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,610
Damn it.

30
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,050
What's this? What's this?

31
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,310
Die! Die!

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,220
Let go! Let go!

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,070
Damn it!

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,330
You punks!

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,990
Who was it this time? Who caused the problem this time?

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,320
What, you guys will die with loyalty?

37
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,270
So that's how you're playing it?

38
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,300
What are you doing?

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,490
Stop that!

40
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,970
Ah, really Seo Yeon?

41
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,850
If you don't speak up right now, I'm going to upload these photos to the internet.

42
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,680
Let's see if they still like you after seeing you like this.

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,120
Let's just handle this with words.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,340
Come on, give it to me.

45
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,580
Damn it.

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,840
Come on!

47
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,990
Aish, really!

48
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,250
Stop it, really!

49
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,720
♫  Despacito quiero respirar tu cuello despacito  ♫

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,800
What the heck?

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,490
That's right, it's me!

52
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,270
She was really clingy, so I told her that I had another woman.

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,170
What good is it to be a younger sibling? You should help out your brothers when they're struggling.

54
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,370
Yeah, where else would you use your strength?

55
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,860
Exactly! Don't act like an amateur who's done this once or twice.

56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,460
You guys!

57
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

58
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,270
Amateur?!

59
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,220
When I raised you all...

60
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,860
I'm the older one!

61
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,250
 Long ago, I was also a tenderhearted girl with big dreams.

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,360
 From now on, Seo Yeon and Mom will live here.

63
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,890
 Here, there's a dad and two older brothers.

64
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,050
 So, you're Seo Yeon.

65
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,140
 We'll live well, right?

66
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,650
 Beautiful Mom, impressive Stepfather,

67
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,070
 handsome older brothers,

68
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,090
 and...

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,490
 a shining younger sibling.

70
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,640
 From all of that, I knew I would be happy.

71
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,830
 I like...

72
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,070
 Your...

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,950
 older brother.

74
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,400
 I know your older brother has a girlfriend,

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,230
 but still, I wanted to have my feelings known.

76
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,030
 Can you tell him for me?

77
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,270
 Because we're friends.

78
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,290
 Can you give these to your brothers?

79
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,880
 Please give these!

80
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,960
-  I love you! 
 - I love you!

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,580
 I love you!

82
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,410
 I love you. Please tell that to them.

83
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,110
 I love him!

84
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,460
 Throw it out.

85
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,620
 You keep it.

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,380
 - I'm handsome, what can I do about it? 
 - I have no interest, you know that!

87
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,500
 I'm just too popular.

88
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,150
 Oppa, I want to see you so much.

89
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,140
 I love you.

90
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,760
 -Just throw it all away! 
-Say there's none. 
-Are they good looking?

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,280
 - People can change. 
 - There was someone like her? Just throw it away.

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,870
 You little things are so cheeky.

93
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,090
 - I'm so sick of it! 
 - You understand.

94
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,370
 But!

95
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,680
 My happiness disappeared after seeing the pour souls being hurt by my brothers.

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,560
 I learned a bone-crushing life lesson.

97
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
 Hate Pretty Boy

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,040
 Guys who look handsome have nothing but their faces.

99
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,080
 For sure.

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,470
- Ya! 
 - Oh! Ah!

101
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,150
 Episode One

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,670
Am I crazy?

103
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,870
Yes.

104
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,330
 Twenty minutes. No, I'll be there in just fifteen minutes.

105
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,960
Let's just forget about the contract.

106
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,940
 T-Then, just five minutes!

107
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,490
- I'll give you ten minutes. 
-  Y-Yeah, ten minutes. Wait, what?

108
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,090
 Why all of a sudden?

109
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,750
I just saw something amusing that could be fun.

110
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
- I'm going to bathroom.  
 - Okay.

111
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,860
That...

112
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,600
man who just left. Is that your boyfriend?

113
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,260
Pardon?

114
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,870
- That's...
 - I guess I made a mistake.

115
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,260
No.

116
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,190
He's just a friend.

117
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,400
Then, would you give me your contact information?

118
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,330
Thank you.

119
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,630
Oh?

120
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,540
Didn't you leave a memo?

121
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,100
Some girl gave me her contact information. She's not my style.

122
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,800
 018-3358-405
Woo Min Ah

123
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,540
I took exactly ten minutes!

124
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,010
That's all you have?

125
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,100
I won't stay long.

126
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,680
Hey, you want to know something funny?

127
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,470
 Oppa, hear me out!

128
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,970
- Listen to what I'm saying!
 - Hey, let go!

129
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,640
Why are you being like this?

130
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,100
How dare she?

131
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,490
What?

132
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,690
- I'm just asking that you listen to me! 
 - Let go of me!

133
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,150
This is the budget for the track and field competition, which will start in a month.

134
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,010
The kids' conditions and their records are very good.

135
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,980
Especially Lee Joo Hee. If she kept going at this rate,

136
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,720
she might be able to get placed well at this competition so she could go to college with scholarship–

137
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,350
Would she be able to go to Seol National University, Korea University, Yonsei University?

138
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,420
What?

139
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,650
Sogang, Sungkyunkwan, Hanyang, Chung-Ang, Kyung Hee,  Hanguk Foreign Studies, University of Seoul?

140
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,500
Well... Even though you didn't mention this college–

141
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,050
That's what I'm saying. For a no-name college, a physical education major student,

142
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,920
why should the school pay money to send just one student to  that  college.

143
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Is that so?

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,990
This student has enough potential and talent. They could even be active at the international lev–

145
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,780
I got it, I got it. I got it for now.

146
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,050
Budget aside, the chief director's position is vacant right now.

147
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,020
When  the chief director's position is filled,  let's bring this up again.

148
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,630
The competition is next month. If you review this beforehand—

149
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,500
Teacher Joo! Your contract ends next year, right?

150
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,200
Staying still can take us halfway. (A proverb)

151
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,060
A proverb is never wrong.

152
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,360
You keep trying to go further, which causes problems. Problems!

153
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,160
Then what–

154
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,400
That's right. It's up to next year.

155
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,030
Next year.

156
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,860
This school is so unfair, seriously!

157
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,440
Ah, really!

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Take this!

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,700

160
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,790
 Lee Joo Hee

161
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,790
 The call cannot be completed. You will be forwarded to voicemail.

162
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,960
Joo Hee, it's your teacher. Why didn't you come to school today?

163
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,600
Are you sick?

164
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
There's not much time until the competition.

165
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,800
Call me if you get this message. I'm still fine even if it's late.

166
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,670

♫  I'm curious about you, how's your day? Oh, tell me (Oh yeah oh yeah)  ♫

168
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,600
♫  Oh yeah, oh yeah  ♫

169
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,210
♫   What makes you happy?   ♫

170

♫  Oh, text me (Oh yeah oh yeah)  ♫

♫  Oh yeah, oh yeah  ♫

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,700
♫  Your every picture, I wanna have under my pillow   ♫

173
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,960
♫   Come be my teacher, Teach me everything about you  ♫

174
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,740
♫  Your one, your two  ♫

175
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,820
- It hurts! 
 - Hey, get up.

176
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,220
Be quiet! If your classes are over, go home.

177
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,210
Please don't be like that!

178
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,490
- You all get demerits. 
 - Oh, Teacher!

179
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,140
- Demerits are too harsh–  
 - Move!

180
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,160
You!

181
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,160
Qu-quickly, the people who have to clean will do that, and the people going home will leave.

182
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,730
Leave, I'm leaving as well.

183
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,180
Follow me.

184
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,620
Ah, it hurts!

185
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,500

186
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,400
A strip show at a school?

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,720
You've finally gone crazy.

188
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,010
What do you mean, strip show? It was dance practice!

189
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,810
♫  I used to need wake-up calls in the morning  ♫

190
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,930
Don't you know I'm a trainee at HM?

191
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,660
Alright, your debut song can be "Give Me Back My Leg."

192
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,850
"Give Me Back My Leg?" What are you talking about?

193
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,710
♫  I wear new shoes  ♫

194
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,180
I just really want your legs to avoid injury.

195
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,400
I have done wrong, I have learned my lesson.

196
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,660
If you're like this one more time, I don't care if you're a trainee or not. You're finished, understand?

197
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,620
I got it.

198
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,250
Hello? Jeong Tae.

199
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,250
What? Where?

200
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,160
Wait a moment!

201
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,100
I did something bad!

202
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,340
Fine! I'm sorry. I forgot my position as a teacher and I looked at him like a woman.

203
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,350
I filmed your handsome younger brother.

204
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,590
That's right, that's what I did!

205
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,850
- Take it off.
 - Hey, I'm sorry!

206
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,430
I said I'm sorry!

207
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,510
That doesn't mean you have to film my body too! You know this is revenge hidden camera, right?

208
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,600
- Take it off! 
- Ah, no!

209
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,970
No! Only my man can see me with my clothes off!

210
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,040
You can't!

211
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,570
You have so much to say! I just got a call from Jeong Tae.

212
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,120
What?! What did that bastard say?

213
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,500
He's someone you couldn't even find a hair of.

214
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,730
Why? Why would you take the call? Do you have no pride?

215
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,950
He said he has something important to say, so we're meeting later.

216
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,820
So, give me your clothes!

217
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,770
Where did he say to meet? Kimbap Heaven?

218
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,460
Or the 13th bench at Yeouido Park?

219
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,000
Their vending machine coffee is really good.

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,410
Hey! You better not go. If you go, I'll kill you!

221
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,370
Choose. Your eyes or Oh Jeong Tae?

222
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,850
Do you want to die?

223
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,620
My fingernails, fingernails, fingernails!

224
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,870
They were so expensive!

225
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,660
You're so crazy about him that you must be blind, but that guy is a complete asshole!

226
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,110
He said to meet at Fantasia.

227
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,470
Oh? The Fantasia in Chungdam?

228
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,390
That place that's known for p-proposals?

229
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,430
T-Then?

230
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,120
Finally!

231
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,780
That's right, you must wear this if you're going to get a proposal.

232
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,240
What are you doing? Take it off!

233
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,390
To say that you're finally getting married...

234
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,160
And with my ideal type.

235
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,380
Sure, your ideal type.

236
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,670
He's your ideal type.

237
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,570
 - We look so good together right?
 - Yeah.

238
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,260
Seo Yeon.

239
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,380
Jeong Tae?

240
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,410
Who..?

241
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,800
It's me, Oppa Jeong Tae.

242
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,560
J-J-Jeong Tae?

243
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,430
I've changed, right? I got plastic surgery during the month.

244
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,430
But why? You made your pretty face into this?

245
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,000
Just what exactly did you do to your face?

246
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,840
Can you let go?

247
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,340
It cost 20 million won (about $17K USD).

248
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,410
Why?

249
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,850
 No, it's okay. It's an immutable law.

250
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,390
 Even though his outer appearance changed, his personality didn't.

251
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,930
 That's right, Jeong Tae is still Jeong Tae.

252
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,370
Seo Yeon...

253
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,350
 Finally!

254
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,240
Yes?

255
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,430
Now let's...

256
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,790
 A ring?

257
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,950
 Proposal?

258
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,850
...break up.

259
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,020
I went on an arranged date for marriage.

260
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,470
I've always had high standards since I was young.

261
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,050
I thought I wouldn't find any woman to my tastes, but I finally found one.

262
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,560
She's a former Miss Korea contestant, but she has a golden body proportion,  34-24-32.

263
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,360
But you...

264
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,760
Now, I should meet a woman that fits me.

265
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:09,300
♫  All by myself, don't want to be   ♫

266
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,890
♫  All by myself, anymore  ♫

267
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,430
Are you done?

268
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,970
♫  All by–  ♫

269
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,370
Why do you always show your misery here?

270
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,570
It's free.

271
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Every guy looks a fop dandy...

272
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,160
34, 24, 32.

273
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,150
I'd get hit on anywhere else.

274
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,560
All your eyes are messed up, aren't they!

275
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,380
Hey!

276
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,630
This is a gay bar, you know.

277
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,850
Do you know what your problem is?

278
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm less pretty than all the men here.

279
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,140
Cruel discrimination based on appearance.

280
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,140
Wait, who are you to– Don't you see?

281
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,350
That there are only good looking men here?

282
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,010
So what? People normally seek out pretty things.

283
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,170
You're saying I discriminate based on appearance even after you say so?

284
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,730
If he's handsome, then he's rude. If he's ugly, then he's kind.

285
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,660
Judging people based on their looks like you are–isn't that a more cruel discrimination on appearance?

286
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,560
Whose fault is that?

287
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,760
You're not crying, right?  You drank alcohol, too.

288
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,530
If you really liked that guy, you would be crying even though you don't want to,

289
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,020
and you wouldn't have an appetite even though you want to drink.

290
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,370
You only liked that punk's face, that's all.

291
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,780
What do you know, younger older brother?

292
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,800
You switch guys every other day! What would you know about love?

293
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,980
Careful.

294
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,130
I'll contact you.

295
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,220
Please take care of her, Driver (formal).

296
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,510
You're so dirty I could die.

297
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,290
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm sorry!

299
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,190
I'm sad. I've been rejected.

300
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:23,580
One tear, can just one tear come out? Huh?

301
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,940
Yeah.

302
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,300
Alcohol? I'd like that, of course!

303
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,710
Let's drink and die? Where are you?

304
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,210
Ah, deal!

305
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,200
 You, who is prettier than flowers

306
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,710
I mean, is this a dog-like situation?

307
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,160
If he was going to break up with you, why'd he tell you to meet him there?

308
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,480
He must've had a 50% off coupon that had to be used by today.

309
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,260
He must've been embarrassed to use the coupon in front of the girl he was meeting for the first time.

310
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,360
Isn't that guy crazy?

311
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,390
Ugly guys are always messing around.

312
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,680
You're not actually going to contact him, right?

313
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,420
Protect it! Let's protect your last bits of pride, okay?

314
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
Who's this handsome guy?

315
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,310
- Oh Jeong Tae. 
 - What?

316
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,960
Contact him. Let's ask him what hospital he went to.

317
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,190
But why do you have his pictures?

318
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,760
He wanted me to remember his new self and not his old, so I asked him to take a selfie.

319
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,130
Did he take that since you asked so?

320
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,560
He is like that, but you are quite something too.

321
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,200
You're probably the only girl that would ask a guy who rejected her to take a selfie. How refreshing.

322
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,140
While looking at this picture, I'm going to remember it forever.

323
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,420
What?

324
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,530
That good-looking guys cannot be trusted.

325
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,500
After that kind person changed his face, he completely changed!

326
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,840
Do you think what you're saying makes sense?

327
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,980
Did your brain get shrunk after you got dumped?

328
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,220
That surprised me! Don't do that!

329
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,380
Are you okay?

330
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,750
Are you crying?

331
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,360
Why are you crying over such a bastard like him?

332
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,630
Don't cry. Look at me, okay?

333
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,820
I like it.

334
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,350
 You, who is prettier than flowers

335
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,050
I admit it.

336
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,000
Ugh, you're a neighborhood nuisance.

337
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,970
I'll be a dog if I drink again.

338
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,960
What did I drink so much?

339
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,070
This. Oh!

340
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,340
I'm sorry!

341
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,190
I'm sorry.

342
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,460
Don't get any closer!

343
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,260
Move it away!  Move it away!  Shoo! Shoo!

344
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,740
Shoo! Ah!

345
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,410
What's this? So dirty!

346
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,200
Crazy!

347
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,590
Dirty.

348
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,210
Oh, it's really filthy!  Sock!
