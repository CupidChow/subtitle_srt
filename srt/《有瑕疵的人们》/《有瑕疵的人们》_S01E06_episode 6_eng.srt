00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,900
 Episode 6

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,970
Hello.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,600

4
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,800
What is that?

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,440
Right.  Even for you, you wouldn't go that low.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,250
Right?  I trust you, Lee Kang Woo.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,470
What's with her?

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,630
 Just what? What is lacking

9
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,930
 Wealth.  It's money.  People judge other's wealth based on cars.

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,230
Joo Seo Yeon.  You're not different from other women.

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,970
Your gaze at me changed just with this mere car.

12
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,890
I'm going to show her how the roof opens.

13
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,010
Oh gosh!  You startled me!

14
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,980
Ah, Chief Director, are you going somewhere?

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,510
- I'm going home. 
 - I see.

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,990
You know that we'll have a welcome party for you later, right?

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,730
- I must attend, right? 
 - Pardon?

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,520
I almost got fooled again.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,190
You have a good sense of humor for such a young man.

20
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,060
When he asked, "I must attend, right?" for a party for him,

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,950
I had no idea how to answer that.

22
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,030
Then see you later.

23
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,740
Yes, well...

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,270
By the way, it's a very nice car.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,510
It smells like a new car too.  You're driving such a car...

26
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,360
The owner of the chicken place surely said she went to this school.

27
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,170
Then she must be a teacher here.

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,350
I found her, the teacher.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,200
Welcome party? My foot.  I don't even have enough time to work out.

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
I should change the passcode.

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,290
I'm dying after I was running around with that idiot all day long, in case he would say something stupid.

32
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,820
Who?

33
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,790
Park Seong Min in my company.

34
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,280
- Fire him. 
 - Are you crazy?  How much does  he make for us?

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,830
Oh, right.  Kim Mi Kyung asked what your relationship with Shinhwa Food is.  What's going on?

36
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,400
I went to work.

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,520
Went to work?

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
As a school chief director.

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,130
Ah, Shinhwa High School.

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,830
What does that have to do with Kim Mi Kyeong?

41
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,250
She is a teacher over there.

42
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,570
Kim Mi Kyeong is a teacher?

43
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,700
What's funnier is that Joo Seo Yeon is a teacher there too.

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,160
What the heck.  Neither one look like teachers.

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,070
Hey, you idiot. Did you go to work there because of her?

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,760
Did you flush away my words with your poop?

47
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,890
I told you to not let them find out about your family.

48
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,520
Do you know how scary people are when they try to do something with determination?

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,520
A truckload of girls jump all over even a guy like me.  Nonetheless, what would happen to you?

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,520
You should've just stayed quiet and gotten married quietly. You have no idea how scary this world is.

51
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,750
Take it easy.  If you die from working out so much, what will be good for you?

52
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,260
It didn't happen from working out.  Why are you here?

53
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,940
Oh, right!  Hey.

54
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,820
Hey, this.  By chance, is it you?

55
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,530
Park Seong Min was suddenly on the real-time search list so I was startled when I was looking at it.

56
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,950
People were saying this guy looks exactly like Park Seong Min's back.  But he was in a shoot at that time.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,540
I definitely think it looks like you.  Isn't it you?

58
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,340
Right.  There is no chance It could be you.

59
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,970
Ah, why are there so many guys with a great build these days? It would lose their scarcity.

60
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm hungry.  Do you have anything to eat?  Ah, hungry.

61
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,490
 Are you alright?

62
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,270
 Ah, yeah, yeah. Yes.

63
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,190
This design only looks great on guys with a slim body and over 180 cm (~5' 11") of height.

64
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,270
So not anyone can pull this off.  It fits very well to you.

65
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,900
I'll take it.

66
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,590
It's 830 thousand won.

67
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,490
 The amount exceeds the credit limit.

68
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,700
Do you have another credit card?

69
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,160
It says the amount exceeds the limit.

70
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,990
It was so embarrassing.

71
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,260
 Meeting the most notable female in 2019, Lee Kang Hee, Director of Sinhwa Food

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,990
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

73
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,550
Guys, keep looking ahead. Right.

74
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,180
♫  Making everybody happy  ♫

75
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,410
Is this all you can do?  Do you think you can debut like this?

76
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,610
Joo Seo Joon, you're just goofing around, believing in your looks, right?

77
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,970
Hyeong Won has a great look too.

78
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,430
I'm sure you also know who will make it in the end if you keep doing it like this.

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,300
All of you, practice that dance a hundred more times before you leave.

80
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,500
If I find out anyone didn't practice it a hundred times more when I check later, I'll kick him out.

81
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,370
- Understand it? 
- Yes.

82
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,660
Is something bothering you?  You don't seem as swift as you always are.

83
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,680
I don't know.  I don't feel like doing this today.

84
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,730
What? Girl trouble?

85
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,870
What are you talking about?

86
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,640
If not, then never mind.

87
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,340
You need to practice a hundred times.

88
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,570
I'm going to the bathroom.  You said I was not swift. I'll go empty myself.

89
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,300
Ah really!

90
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,660
Why didn't someone flush down after pooping?!

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,520
Ah really!

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,540
My gosh. It all costs me money to cover all these.  My money.

93
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,930
Hey, we all use that together. Try to conserve a little.

94
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,610
One sheet is enough to wipe your hands, isn't it?

95
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,880
That little rude jerk!

96
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,390
I'm sure someone cast him just because of his face.

97
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Why do they have no love for their company?  Why do they make it so dirty?  These stupid idiots.

98
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,230
- Are you giving lessons for comprehensive personality development?

99
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,310
Yes, we give them a special lecture once a month.

100
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,340
- And that's how they are? 
 - Pardon?

101
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,910
Do it more often, once a week.  If we let guys with bad behavior debut, it'll cause us trouble.

102
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,320
We'll end up paying for the damage.

103
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,710
Yes, I understand.

104
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,400
And start managing the school grades as well.

105
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,100
It's really difficult to work with ignoramuses.

106
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,830
It is surely difficult.  With this chance, let's get rid of the ignoramuses.

107
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,140
An idol group that's handsome and smart. Isn't it a nice concept?

108
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,930
Yes, I'll carry out your order.

109
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,190
 Kim Mi Kyeong.

110
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,690
What a fuss...

111
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,690
What was Lee Kang Woo thinking without any fear?

112
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,100
How dare he ignore my phone calls the entire day?

113
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,920
 40 years Traditional Spare Ribs

114
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,800
- Are you going to eat  pork neck too? 
 - Yeah.

115
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,630
- There're marinated pork ribs. Are you going to eat them, too? 
 - Sure.

116
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,750
What about pork rinds?  Are you going to eat too?

117
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,210
Ah, please!  You're going to stuff all of them anyway, so order whatever you want!

118
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,960
- Okay, I got it. 
 - The number you called...

119
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,390
This is so unbelievable!

120
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,920
 The number you called...

121
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,050
 40 years Traditional Spare Ribs

122
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,440
How dare these two punks ignore me?  My pride!

128

Don't you all know how unhealthy this fat is?

129
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,030
This is all fat.

130
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,360
That petty and cheap punk.  How dare he shows off his authority over food?

131
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,740
Why isn't this getting cooked already?

132
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,390
Eat. It's still meat.

134

♫  I know it just looking at your eyes  ♫

135
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,910
♫  Just looking at you  ♫

136
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,370
♫  You're in my heart  ♫

137
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,890
Don't act so annoyingly.  Just buy more yourselves with your own money!

138
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,320
 You should try it.  You don't have enough brains?

139
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,880
 Stop it, you man.

140
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,830
Hey, hey! Attention!

141
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,630
All right.  Let's stop eating and move.  I'll treat you.

142
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,470
What?  Alright.  Let's move.

143
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,350
But how can I stop eating when I didn't eat enough?

144
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,560
Let's go.  Let's go.

145
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,340
- Let's go. 
 - No.

146
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,030
Chief Director!  Let me go with you.

147
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,100
Pardon?

148
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,320
When will I be able to ride a car like this?  The car is very nice.

149
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,470
Wait.  Wait a minute.

150
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,690
Hold on! Hold on!

151
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,460
Chief Director!

152
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,020
Oh my!  Your hand!

153
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,690
Oh my! Your hand.   What shall I do?

154
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,110
My hand got already hurt earlier.

155
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm truly sorry!

156
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,110
Where?  Which finger does it hurt?

157
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,630
I'm truly sorry.  Sorry.

158
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,580
Let's go.

159
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,250
When did the two of them become so close?

160
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,780
Birds of a feather flock together.  Shall we take a taxi?

161
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,470
Do we have to go?

162
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,820
I told you there would be nothing good if you got on the wrong side of Lee Kang Woo.

163
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,430
Teachers, would you like me to drive you?

164
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,200
 Novice Driver

165
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,980
You must've learned how to drive lately.

166
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,230
Yes.  I didn't need to drive a car.

167
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,730
When did you learn how to drive?

168
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,760
Hmm... The year before last year.

169
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,430
Two years?  He's been driving for two years but how terrible he drives...

170
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm a slow learner.

171
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,240
If it's to hard for you, shall I drive instead?

172
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,190
Right.  She is very good at driving.

173
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,120
No, thank you.  You can relax.

174
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,590
How can I when you're not letting us relax?

175
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,070
Oh right.  I'm telling this only to you.

176
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,870
Our new chief director is the grandson of Shinhwa Food.

177
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,590
Is that so?

178
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,430
I'm only telling you so that you won't get on his bad side.  So line up well.

179
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,030
Hey! How could you say something political like that at the school where students are taught?

180
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,060
A school is a sacred place.  So what about his being the grandson of Shinhwa Food?

181
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,600
- You're sweating again. 
 - What?

182
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,940
You shouldn't be scared when you say things like that.

183
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,970
Were you two already friends?   Or...

184
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,530
We went to the same middle school.

185
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,230
To be honest, the chief director also—

186
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

187
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,290
- You scumbag! 
 - Calm down!  Calm down!

188
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,960
Drive properly!

189
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,940
What should I do?

190
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,280
Just wash your face.

191
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,780
By the way, I'm familiar with this place.

192
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,570
Are you stupid?  It's  that  place.

193
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,170
This is where Oh Jeong Ta dumped you.  It's Fantasia.

194
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,970
Right.  It's that place.

195
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,000
This place is owned by Shinhwa Food as well.

196
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,930
Wait.  Didn't Lee Kang Woo say that it's his treat?

197
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,350
I'm going to order two of the very most expensive dishes.

198
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,970
Hey, I'm going to go order now.

199
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,640
Gosh, she's crazy about food.

200
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,220
How could she think about eating food at the place where she got dumped?  Gosh!

201
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,550
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

202
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,600
You!

203
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,500
Are you crazy?  You're going to drive like this?

204
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,680
Hey.  Give it to me.

205
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
Wait.  I'll call a substitute driver.

206
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,980
Hey.  I told you to give it to me.

207
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,240
Are you giving me a hard time because I dumped you?

208
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,690
Are you giving me a hard time because I dumped you?

209
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,100
You lunatic.

210
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,280
Right.  So I was punished for dumping you.  So what?

211
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,340
So she rejected my proposal!

212
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,330
W-What?  You proposed?

213
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,190
It hasn't been long since we broke up!  You already—

214
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,920
She said she hated that I got plastic surgery but liked someone with a natural face.

215
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,130
I spent so much money on this face.

216
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,910
I spent so much money on this face!

217
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,150
Give that to me.  I'm going home.

218
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,370
Snap out of it!

219
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,230
Hey!  Who are you? So you stop me?

220
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,320
Wow, I didn't know there was such a grand place!

221
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
I must've had a lucky dream last night, riding in a nice car and this place...

222
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,320
It was a very nice riding, Chief Director.

223
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,060
I'll go inside first.

224
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,950
Nice riding?  My foot.  He turned the steering wheel
however he wanted.

225
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,350
Let it go! Give me my key back!

226
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,020
I told you to wait.  I'm calling a substitute driver.

227
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,990
You punk, are you out of mind?

228
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,470
Where are you going?  If you want to go, give me a key—

229
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,180
If you want to die, die alone.

230
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,020
- Who are you trying to kill? 
 - You're not my mother.

231
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,280
You really!

232
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,340
W-What?  What?  What?

233
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,930
Hey, what are you doing?

234
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,580
Are you out of your mind?

235
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,650
Without any fear, by yourself?  What were you trying to do with a drunken man?

236
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,390
Hello, I'm at Fantasia in Cheongdam-dong.

237
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,390
To Park Apartment in Sangam-dong.  Yes.

238
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,590
Who is he that you even know his address?

239
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,200
My ex-boyfriend.

240
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,790
You haven't changed.

241
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,760
Joo Seo Yeon.  You still go for guy's looks.

242
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,520
- What? 
 - What's your deal?

243
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,960
How could a man like him—

244
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,790
Why are such men—

245
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,390
Why do I... You...

246
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,520
Why do I—

247
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,380
Yes.  You're here?

248
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,230
This is awesome.

249
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,060
- Look at this. 
 - I can't believe this.

250
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,900
We're acting so obvious that we don't come to places like this.

251
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,780
We're acting so obvious that we don't come to places like this.

252
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,440
- I've been here before. 
 - Those are real flowers.

253
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,950
Even though you do it, is it working?

254
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,920
 You haven't changed. Joo Seo Yeon.  You still go for guy's looks.

255
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,940
 I don't like you because you're ugly and fat.

256
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,750
 I'm old-fashioned. I don't usually come to fancy places like this.

257
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,260
-  So you—  
 - What's the matter?

258
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,710
You said you were going to order a lot of food.

259
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,510
What?  Yes.

260
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,680
Excuse me.  Do you have a menu?

261
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,200
I'm sorry. A special meal was reserved for today.

262
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,500
Oh...

263
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,190
 Vice Principal, you don't need to do that.

264
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,490
 You don't have to.

265
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,500
It's good.

266
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,320
 Why on earth did I like a girl like her?

267
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,980
 Why did I like a girl like her?  Why on earth?

268
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,360
All right.  Please help yourselves!

269
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,180
They are all very healthy.

270
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,610
Vice Principal, please have some.

271
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,210
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

272
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,070
When will you be serving other dishes?

273
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,590
This is everything for today's meal.

274
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,290
What?  Then can I order a different dish—

275
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,570
I'm sorry. The time for the last order has already passed.

276
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,920
Excuse me—

277
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,420
Here, here, here!

278
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,980
Well, the atmosphere at the barbecue restaurant wasn't right so I didn't say it.

279
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,430
But on a day like today, it's impossible not to listen to a few words from the chief director.

280
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,210
Please say a few words, Chief Director.

281
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,530
- No, it's alright. 
 - Please say something.

282
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,560
Please say something.

283
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,300
Yes.  I believe running a school is also a business.

284
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,400
To evaluate the performance of a business, we can take not only profit gains,

285
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
but also the college enrollment rate and employment rate into consideration.

286
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,010
Of course, educating students to become morally good members of society is very important too.

287
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,870
Learning such virtues will depend on the teachers.

288
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,180
♫  I know it just looking at your eyes   ♫

289
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,730
Please enjoy the meal I prepared for you.

290
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,050
♫  Just looking at you  ♫

291
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,110
♫  You're in my heart  ♫

292
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,960
Over there!

293
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,380
What do you think about criticizing someone based on one's looks, Teacher over there?

294
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,140
Pardon?

295
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,410
For example, if a student says, "you're ugly

296
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,970
and fat."  to someone right to his face,

297
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,760
what kind of lesson will you give to that mean student?

298
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,140
What? You seem like you don't have anything to say.

299
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,930
That student is very honest.

300
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,670
Yes.  People ought to be honest.

301
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,760
Then Chief Director, what lesson will you give to a student

302
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,530
who would hit on a girl that he doesn't know well and abruptly ask her to go out with him?

303
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,580
Hitting on her?

304
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:08,350
And what lesson will you give to a student who holds a grudge against someone for something that happened ages ago?

305
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,420
Grudge?

306
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,050
Teacher Joo!  What are you doing right now?!

307
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,210
The chief director asked me first!

308
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,950
Chief Director!  The vibe of the dinner isn't good. Why don't I pour you a drink?

309
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,790
No, thank you.  I don't drink.

310
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,980
No, no.  I'll give you a glass of drink.

311
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,750
What should I do?  That way is to the bathroom.

312
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,620
I don't drin—

313
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,090
 What?

314
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,190
You can use soap.

315
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,510
What?

316
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,300
Are you out of mind?  You can't go a day without causing trouble?

317
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,190
He picked a fight with me first.

318
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,110
Are you a gamecock?  You would throw a punch without thinking because he picked a fight?

319
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,290
Why are you only yelling at me?

320
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,420
Of course I'm yelling at you!  Then should I do it to the chief director?

321
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,740
How many times did I tell you he is holding your lifeline?

322
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,100
You don't understand it?

323
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
I know.  I understand.

324
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,290
When you knew it, you behaved like that? Go apologize to him right away!

325
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,350
What apology?  Forget it.

326
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,590
Go!  Not going?

327
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,810
- Go! 
 - My gosh, I'm going.

328
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,060
She's even hitting on Lee Min Hyeok too as if she doesn't have enough men?

329
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,830
Really.

330
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,930
 Men's room

331
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,010
Excuse me.

332
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,680
What I said... happened when I was young.

333
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,970
Please forget what I said.

334
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,370
It's up to you whether you would accept my apology or not.

335
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,940
I can't do anything about it if you don't accept it.

336
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,820
Still... I hope we can get along.

337
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,740
No, no, no, no!  That's not it!

338
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,670
 That's right.

339
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,960
 Let's wrap up now.

340
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,420
 Take your seat now.

341
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,230
 She likes him.

342
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,750
 I just ... From that moment...

343
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,250
 That's right.  It had to be you.

344
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:44,890

345
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:51,690
♫  I just happened to meet you by chance and I fell in love with you  ♫

346
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:59,000
♫  I didn't realize that day by day, time was passing  ♫

347
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,220
 The budget for our track team.

348
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,720
 Chief Director didn't come to work today.

349
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,760
 I definitely think Kang Woo is messing with you.

350
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,460
 How dare you joke around with me?

351
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,220
 Wake up, you punks!

352
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,230
 Oh my gosh!  You startled me!

353
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,790
 Health Teacher, why do you keep giving Seo Yeon something to eat?

354
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,470
 To lure her.

355
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,720
 You get nervous just by looking at her, right?

356
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,580
 I just realized now like a fool that I didn't need any other women except you.

357
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,490
♫  Are you happy after you left me  ♫

358
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,200
♫  I'm not  ♫
