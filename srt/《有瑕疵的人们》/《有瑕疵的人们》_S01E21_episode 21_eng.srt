1
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,750
Seo Yeon...

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,680
Come to your senses, Seo Yeon. 
 Episode 21

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,860

4
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,460
Mom...

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,340
It's okay.

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,920
Mom...

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,310
It's okay, Seo Yeon.

8
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,690
Dad...

9
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,580
It's okay, Seo Yeon.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,090
Seo  Yeon, listen to me very well.

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,060
Here... We have to leave here.

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,890
You got that?

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,440
What about Dad?

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,260
I'll get out of here too.

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,580
So... You leave first.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,930
And ask someone to help.

17
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,220
Dad.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,930
Seo Yeon...

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,440
Keep in your mind, don't  look back.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,530
Mom and Dad are fine, so...

21
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,350
Never, never look back.

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,960
You can promise me that, right?

23
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,790
My good daughter.

24
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,650
Hurry.  Hurry go.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,330
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,460
Dad... Dad is sorry.

27
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,370
 Seo Yeon, don't look back.

28
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,840
 Don't look back and go.

29
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,850
 Mom and Dad are fine, so...

30
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,490
 Don't ever look back.

31
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,980
 You can promise me that, right?

32
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,160
Please save us.

33
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,230
Save us.

34
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,000
Pardon?

35
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,960
What does that–

36
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,900
What are you talking about? An accident?

37
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,070
What hospital did you say?

38
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,030
I got it.

39
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,250
What happened?

40
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,380
A car accident.

41
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,490
A car accident happened.

42
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,410
Huh?

43
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,950
I don't know. Let's just go for now.

44
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,040
Ah, that's crazy.

45
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,180
You startled me!

46
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,690
What happened?

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,590
Why are you doing this to me?

48
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,080
I really don't remember at all!

49
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
Why are you acting like this?

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Hey!  Who are you?

51
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,180
Let him go!

52
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,830
- Don't do this! 
 - Let him go!

53
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,160
Hey! Hey!

54
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,550
Let him go!

55
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,280
I'll kill him!

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,730
No, no! Don't!

57
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,290
Because of that bastard!

58
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,580
Joo Won Seok!

59
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,910
Are you a gangster or what?

60
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,390
Go by the law! Go by the law! You can go by the law!

61
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,550
Shut your mouth.

62
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,360
Because if you say anything more, I'll kill you.

63
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,990
How's Seo Yeon?

64
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,460
She still can't remember anything.

65
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,000
You should see Dad last.

66
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,330
I can't do it. I can't do it.

67
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,050
How can I see him?

68
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,200
How can I see him?

69
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,940
 I passed all the guilt, sorrow, and resentment that were to be mine over to my older brothers,

70
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,100
 and my younger brother, and have lived without remembering anything.

71
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,430
Are you going to exercise?

72
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,230
It's not that we didn't tell you on purpose...

73
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,890
I know why you guys didn't do that.

74
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,730
I'm going to go for a run for a bit.

75
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,230
It wasn't because of you.

76
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,170
I'm telling you it wasn't because of you so don't punch at the wrong place.

77
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,290
She thinks that was all her fault, doesn't she?

78
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,060
Everything is ruined.

79
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,130
What about?

80
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,850
What is ruined?

81
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,380
Why are you already awake? Sleep more, sleep more.

82
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,590
What's going on?

83
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,530
There's someone in here. Don't turn off the lights.

84
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,490
Student Joo Hee.

85
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,560
Are you awake?

86
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,620
Mothers or fathers are always like that?

87
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,510
Pardon?

88
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:07,790
For their kids' sake, they can risk their own lives?

89
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,400
They can die in place of their kids?

90
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,010
Wouldn't that be so?

91
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,390
Are your parents like that, too?

92
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,310
I don't remember my dad,

93
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,010
but my mom was like that.

94
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,850
To leave more money, even a penny more, to my sister and me,

95
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,600
she worked at a restaurant just until a day before she passed away.

96
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,900
She passed away?

97
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,620
Yes.

98
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,600
She was very sick.

99
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,910
But... Why all of a sudden?

100
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,230
So moms and dads  are  like that.

101
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,920
I didn't know that.

102
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,360
 We'll live well, right?

103
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,530
 Everything will be fine.

104
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,220
 I'm coming, too.

105
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,540
 I want to see which guy is giving our Seo Yeon a hard time.

106
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,400
 Come to your senses, Seo Yeon.

107
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,460
 I'm sorry.

108
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,630
 Mom and Dad are fine, so...

109
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,150
 Don't ever look back.

110
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,410
 You can promise me that, right?

111
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,120
 Lee Kang Woo

112
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,010
 Your phone will be connected to voice mail...

113
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,320
Is she still sleeping?

114
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,430
I couldn't sleep because my heart was fluttering.

115
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,960
I should take her to school!

116
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,440
Chief Director Ahjussi!

117
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,840
Ahjussi?!

118
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm in the same age as your sister.

119
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,270
What about your noona?

120
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,930
- She went to school. 
- Already?!

121
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,100
- Ahjussi. 
- I just told you I'm not an ahjussi, you punk!

122
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,020
Are you dating my sister?

123
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,850
Dating?

124
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,710
Well... I guess so.

125
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,220
Why?

126
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,690
When you're rich and handsome, why do you date my sister?

127
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,730
Since you're young, it seems you don't know your sister's charm well.

128
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,290
True.  If a younger brother knows about his sister's charm well,

129
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,120
it'd be a little strange.

130
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,010
Anyway!

131
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Let's get along well, Brother-in-law!

132
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,880
B-Brother-in-law?

133
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,800
Should I give you a ride?

134
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,370
Yes.

135
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,880
Easy punk.

136
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,770
- Get out. 
- Pardon?

137
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,260
Here? You're not going to come in?

138
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,770
Ahjussi, you're not going to go to work?

139
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm not.

140
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,860
Why?

141
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,800
Just because. I just won't!

142
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,160
By any chance... Were you fired?

143
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,500
- Ahjussi, are you unemployed? 
- No!

144
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,950
Hurry and go!  Tell your sister to come out.

145
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,820
A jobless person is a little bit of...  How does my sister date...

146
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,520
I told you I'm not.

147
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm not unemployed!

148
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,640
Noona!

149
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,090
Ex-Chief Director Ahjussi is waiting for you in front of the school.

150
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:48,640
But you hated people with such looks.  What happened?

151
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,750
You're not going to go out? He's waiting.

152
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,110
I'll handle it myself.  You go to the class quickly.

153
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,120
Joo Seo Joon.

154
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm sorry.

155
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,920
It's scary.

156
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,220
Why's she being like that? Ah, really.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,950
It's okay.

158
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,620
You came?

159
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,150
What is this?

160
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,960
I heard there was a suspicious car in school.  So I came here to check if it's a flasher.

161
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,690
Flasher?  Hey, who said it?

162
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,350
Do you park here to protest being fired?

163
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,430
No.  I came here to see Joo Seo Yeon.

164
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,880
It's Joo Seo Yeon!

165
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,290
 Let's meet later. I'm busy now.

166
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,250
Move your car quickly!

167
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,240
I also want to go to school.

168
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,480
How was it?  Did he leave?

169
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Ex-Chief Director Lee Kang Woo?

170
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,670
Yes, he just left.

171
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,620
He didn't say much but left obediently?

172
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,540
With his temperament, he is not a person who would leave obediently.

173
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,200
It wasn't our intention but...

174
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,560
We talked this and that about ex-chief director with CEO, so...

175
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,420
A little, a very little bit.

176
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,110
Yes, we talked a little bit about him.

177
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,480
Don't worry.  Nothing special will happen.

178
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,290
You're such a nice chief director but CEO didn't...

179
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,310
Why did CEO appoint a person like ex-Chief Director Lee Kang Woo?

180
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,090
That's what I'm saying.

181
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,560
I don't understand. I don't understand.

182
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,020
Then we'll get going.

183
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,110
Thank you.

184
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,240
Yes. Yes.

185
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,880
Thank you.

186
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,400
Let's go together.

187
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,880
I don't think my aunt already took action.

188
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,180
What are you doing?

189
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,160
I should take care of my son myself.

190
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,210
No matter what, you consider your oldest grandson the best.

191
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,960
Are you mad because I made Kang Woo resign from the chief director position?

192
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,400
Yes. I'm mad.

193
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,020
Mother-in-law, you really won't trust Kang Woo?

194
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,580
He has never shown his confidence to us.

195
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,060
That's what I'm saying.

196
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,140
That's why I will take care of Kang Woo from now on.

197
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,270
Your taking care of him by making him go on a blind date?

198
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,000
There are so many good women but why on earth doesn't he?

199
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,090
Why is she so upset?

200
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,460
Because I said I would bring Kang Woo into the main company?

201
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,190
No, that's not it.  I think she is because Kang Woo seems to have a girlfriend.

202
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,930
- What? 
 - That's why she kept being upset.

203
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,830
What kind of woman is she?

204
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,340
I don't know either.  So Mother,

205
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,030
you and I, let's become the same team and help Kang Woo.  Then he'll have some power.

206
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,520
Daughter-in-law!  Daughter-in-law!

207
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,630
- What does it mean? 
 - Wait. Wait. Wait.

208
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,470
Wait, wait.

209
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,720
- I got into trouble!  Big trouble. 
 -  Daugher-in-law!

210
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,860
I made a thing bigger.  I did.

211
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,420
What should I do?  I should call Kang Woo.

212
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,020
Ah, I need to turn off the stove.  Turning off.

213
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,560
Wait.  Where is it?

214
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,020
It's true you have some talents.

215
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,780
I can imagine Park Seong Min and High Seven wearing these clothes.

216
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,550
The smell of money.

217
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,830
What are you thinking about?

218
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,910
We opened our hearts to each other, had a good time, and dated.

219
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,170
But how can she not reply?

220
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,840
Joo Seo Yeon?

221
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,770
Does she have the same schedule as yours?  She is in the middle of class right now.

222
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,620
What does she do during breaks?

223
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,050
How about lunch time?  What is so hard to send a text or call once?

224
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,060
How many times did you call?

225
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,320
- Ten times. 
- You sent messages ten times?

226
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,000
No, I called ten times and sent messages twenty times.

227
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Oh, it's cloying.  Oh, it's cloying.

228
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,800
- Cloying? 
 - Do it in moderation. Before you date properly, she'll get tired of you and run away.

229
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,750
Is that so?

230
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,440
 Park Nuthead

231
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,850
I'm sick and tired of him.

232
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,300
Park Hyeon Soo keeps calling me constantly.

233
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,340
It looks like he really likes you.

234
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,870
If anyone falls under the spell of my charm, they can't get out of it.

235
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,500
I can tell I am like a swamp?

236
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,010
What? There is no way you can like Park Hyeon Soo?

237
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,650
Well, I don't think he is a bad guy but...

238
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,180
I don't know.  It's just...

239
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,650
Looking at him, I think he has many women.

240
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,570
And it's burdensome for me that he owns a much bigger company than I expected.

241
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,680
Didn't you calculate men's conditions?

242
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,100
Once I see a much better condition than I deserve, I get scared since I'm a human being.

243
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,940
I think I like someone three or four times better than me, but not ten times better.

244
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm talking about me.  Only for me.

245
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,550
You know this is not related to Lee Kang Woo and you, right?

246
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,530
Since we're hungry, let's steal some snacks from the health room.

247
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,770
- I'm fine. 
 - Huh?  What?

248
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,020
Just... He is not a health teacher anymore but the chief director.

249
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,950
We can't treat him like we did before.

250
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,860
Wow!  Health Teacher finally ...

251
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,460
Seo Yeon wouldn't come here any more.

252
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,690
Even if you kept preparing snacks for Seo Yeon, she wouldn't come here anymore, Chief Director.

253
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,910
Why not?

254
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,700
Are you asking because you don't know the reason?  What kind of confidence did you have that you confessed  to Seo Yeon?

255
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,190
Don't misunderstand.  You know Seo Yeon is not a person who brags about this kind of stuff, right?

256
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,020
I catch on very quickly.

257
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,740
Was it confidence or conceit?

258
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,100
It was obstinacy.

259
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,900
I thought so.

260
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,600
It's not someone else but Lee Kang Woo.  Then you're cousins anyway.

261
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,610
I request you to give up cleanly so Seo Yeon won't be uncomfortable.

262
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm not sure.

263
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm selfish so I can't stand someone else doing well.

264
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,930
How cool he is when he said such words with that look?

265
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,350
This guy is holding his phone all day long?

266
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,230
Yes?

267
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,050
 What?  If you call me, then talk!

268
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,960
Ah, I didn't expect you would really answer the phone.  I just called you habitually.

269
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,940
Are you kidding me right now, you bastard?  Hang up!

270
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,450
Let's eat. Eat a meal with me.

271
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,670
Thinking about it, I never ate a meal with you.

272
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,760
I don't want to.

273
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,850
- Why not? 
 - If I eat with you, I'll get attached to you.

274
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,190
What is this?  She told me to buy a meal for her.

275
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,900
She doesn't want money nor food.  What should I do, a little Cutie?

276
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,580
 Good Morning!

277
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,110
 Joo Seo Yeon, hello?

278
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,570
 Is it your break time, right???

279
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,520
 Did you eat?

280
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,770
 Did you enjoy it?

281
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,790
 You must be busy.  I miss you so much.

282
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,410
 Make sure to call me after finishing your work.

283
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,200
I think I'm here at the right time.

284
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,480
You look you need these so much right now.

285
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,550
Well— 
 - As you know,

286
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,200
I don't have a friend due to my severe caution to people.

287
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,320
You probably guessed it at the gathering.

288
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,190
Can you eat this with me?

289
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,230
I'm going only to eat it.

290
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,430
As you see, it turned out this way.

291
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,750
Well, it's good.

292
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,600
Thank you for making this happen.

293
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,560
Because of what you said, confronting trauma in order to overcome trauma,

294
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,290
I met Joo Seo Yeon again.

295
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:44,090
Then our consultation will be over today.

296
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,150
But...

297
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,330
How on earth do you do date?

298
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,580
Dating is not my specialty... But...

299
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,420
All the psychological roots are connected to one basis.

300
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,710
What is the problem?

301
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,460
Which one should I ask first?

302
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,580
Take time to think about it.

303
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,150
Is she Seo Yeon?

304
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,070
Why... you... bus stop...

305
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,510
Why didn't you take a bus?

306
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,670
I just walked.  Did you wait for me at the bus stop?

307
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,860
Who waited?

308
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,030
We... just... went...

309
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,190
It was fate, fate, fate.

310
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,870
Let's say it's coincidence and let's have a drink.

311
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,330
Right.  Let's have a drink.

312
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,800
What?  Drink?
