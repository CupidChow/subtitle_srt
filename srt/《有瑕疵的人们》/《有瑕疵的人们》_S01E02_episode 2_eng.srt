1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,430
 Episode 2 
One, two, three, four, switch.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,210
One, two, three, four, neck.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,440
One, two, three, four, switch.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,730
- One, two, three, four, front. 
 - What about Joo Hee?

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,750
One, two, three.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,220
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,380
E-Excuse me. Lee Joo Hee in your class didn't come to school again. Is she sick?

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,050
Did she not contact you?

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,980
No, she didn't.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,360
Then, don't you have to look into it?

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,540
That girl originally never wanted to go to college, so she doesn't care about her attendance.

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,800
If she skipped school so that she didn't bother the hard-working students, I'd be thankful.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,720
Do you think it's easy to look after each and every one of several dozen students?

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,130
If you're curious, why don't you look into it yourself, Teacher Joo.

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,760
PE teachers have a lot of time.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,850
What the—

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,820

19
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,170
Oh, this—

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,300
What's this? Did he not see me?

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,900
Also, this month's electricity bill was so high.

22
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,960
I think it's because of the air conditioner in the classrooms.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,280
So please make sure not to let your students lower the temperature settings on their own.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,090
Yes.

25
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,900
Vice-Principal...

26
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,100
Who did this?

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,790
I said, who did this?!

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,270
The students—

29
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,750
No! No, please stay quietly.

30
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,120
As I was going to the restroom, I let it sit in the sun for a moment, just a very short moment.

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,260
The culprit must be one of the teachers.  Hurry and confess. Who did this?

32
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,870
That person just cut the flower.  This is a very bad person.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,040
Who did this? Are you really going to be like this?

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,850
Who the hell did this?!

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,970
Teacher Joo Seo Yeon!

36
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,300
It was Teacher Joo Seo Yeon.

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,320
Did you get punished a lot?

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,340
That flower doesn't even cost that much. Why is he so harsh on you?

39
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,600
What was with that health teacher?  I was going to confess myself!

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,250
But I was turned into a shameless women because of him.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,890
So why did he do that? He's so good-looking, too.

42
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,050
I knew it. People who look good cannot be trusted.

43
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,300
Let's go. By the way, you're going to go, right?  On Saturday.

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,780
You didn't get the message? There's a middle school reunion.

45
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,150
That's this week?  Of course, I'm going!

46
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,000
It's  a chance that I can eat as much as I want just with  a reunion fee of 10,000 won ($8.40)

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,900
The guys who'll be there are not worth looking at, so I'm going to wear jogger pants!

48
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,440
Yeah!

49
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,670
♪ We'll eat and eat, drink and drink, and party!  ♪

50
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,200
Why would I go there?

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,600
Hey, You came back to Korea after 15 years.  Show them your handsome face.

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,940
Hang up. I'm busy.

53
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,070
Busy? I can tell you're working out from your heavy breaths.

54
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,730
Did you check the contract?

55
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,590
How dare you try to trick me?

56
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,170
A contract with a period of three years? Who says I'll do that?

57
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,450
Did you see that? I put it in a very small font. You have really good eyes.

58
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,430
Rewrite it and send it over. Don't try to trick me again or it's really over.

59
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,720
Hey, I'm Park Hyeon Soo. People line up, wanting to sign with my agency.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,400
Then go ask them.

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,500
 Okay, okay. I'll send the contract again.

62
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,600
But you really don't want to go together?

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,890
Hello? Hey!

64
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,970
What a cold jerk.

65
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,230
Seok Min! Seok Min! Seok Min?   Try to be bolder.

66
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,790
Hey, let's show off your good looking face a little more.

67
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,570
♫  Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito  ♫

68
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,800
Hey, you jerk!

69
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,020
What's that?!

70
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,330
Your mom, why? Where are you going?

71
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,110
Ms. Oh.

72
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,610
How did you know I came here?

73
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,130
I'm your mother. I always know where you are.

74
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,300
It was Park Hyeon Soo, wasn't it?

75
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,950
I-Is Hyeon Soo doing well?

76
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,340
You haven't changed one bit, Ms. Oh.

77
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,920
You should have contacted us first, when you came.

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,930
- How did you sneak in here like a mouse? 
 - Did you get hurt? 
 - It hurts.

79
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,240
Don't tell Grandmother that I came here. I'll leave soon.

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,970
This time you won't be able to leave easily. She is so determined to do something with you.

81
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,230
I'll win.

82
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,270
It won't be that easy this time, she already has a list made.

83
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,940
- A list? 
 - A list of positions that you could possibly take.

84
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,980
I don't like that! There's Noona. Why are you bringing me into this?

85
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,710
Saying that to me doesn't do any good. What power do I have?

86
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,460
I have less power than her.

87
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,020
Whatever! I'm going to take a flight tonight so that's it.

88
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,750
You'll be banned from leaving due to embezzlement.

89
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,760
Embezzlement? What embezzlement?

90
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,100
The CEO has already prepared evidence. It's worth 10 billion won ($8.4 million).

91
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,930
Do you think the police will accept such fake evidence?

92
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,890
Will they believe a CEO or you, who have no money?

93
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,230
Why are you doing this to me?

94
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,290
- If you're upset then stand up to her. 
 - Mom!

95
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,670
You only call me mom when you need my help.

96
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,410
Be quiet and get ready to leave. The CEO is waiting.

97
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,500
What are you doing? Put on clothes and leave.

98
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,070
So frustrating...

99
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,250
Honey! What are you doing?

100
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,050
It hurts.

101
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,910
Yes, Mother-in-law. I'm going to bring  Kang Woo there right now.

102
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,800
This is the latest model. I think it'll suit your son.  Please test drive.

103
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,740
Okay.

104
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,350
Young people enjoy driving fast. If you look over here...

105
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,340
It's quite nice having rich parents. I'm surprised by the fact that a 20-year-old will be driving that car.

106
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,110
- He's a good boy. 
 - What do you mean?

107
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,400
His parents are buying it for him and he's not complaining.

108
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,990
If you're born with a golden spoon, you have to be grateful all the time.

109
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,480
It's so annoying when spoiled rich kids are complaining.

110
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,540
Hey, you're better off than them.

111
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,360
This!

112
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,300
If I were you, I definitely would've become a celebrity.

113
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,370
I bet entertainment companies tried to cast you.

114
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,510
You're too handsome to be ignored.

115
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,570
If I tried to be a celebrity, Won Bin and Jang Woo Sung would be nothing.

116
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,130
Why didn't you try to become it then?

117
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,760
There was a much easier way to earn money.

118
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,740
What's that?

119
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,040
Eating at a dining table with a golden spoon.

120
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,960
Who is that? Kick her out but make sure not to cause a scene.

121
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,520
Okay.

122
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,310
You didn't make a reservation, right?

123
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,040
Please come next time after making a reservation. Come this way.

124
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,410
Please come with a reservation.

125
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,430
Goodbye.

126
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,500
Please come next time!

127
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:16,940

128
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,990
What's the use of having a lot of money?

129
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,700
It's no fun, no fun.

130
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,400
Oh, that surprised me.

131
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,310
What are you doing?

132
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,450
I was waiting.

133
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,570
For me?

134
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,220
Yes.

135
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,730
Is Teacher Joo Seo Yeon very upset?

136
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,980
Her?

137
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,030
Don't worry. She isn't a type person who holds a grudge for a long time.

138
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,050
If you were going to worry, why did you tell on her to the vice principal?

139
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,200
You should've just ignored it.

140
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,240
That's what I was saying.

141
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,940
What?

142
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,020
What did he say?

143
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,120
What a waste. He is so good-looking, too.

144
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,920
- Be careful so that water doesn't get in. 
 - Okay.

145
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,900
Thank you.

146
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,890
Yes?

147
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,960
Oh, today isn't...

148
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,050
Okay. I'll make the time and come.

149
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,750
Okay.

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,350
 Joo Hee? She was kicked out a few days ago for not paying her rent.

151
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,110
 That landlord is so cruel, we can't even mention it.

152
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,000
Where are you right now?

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,740
Okay.

154
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
Why me?

155
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,390
I'm sure you guys would know where she is.

156
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,980
And the kids like you.

157
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,450
Are you finally acknowledging me? Just stay there and watch.

158
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,930
You know that girl in our class, Lee Joo Hee? Where does she work nowadays?

159
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,240
Yeah.

160
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,150
Okay, look into it.

161
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,340
- How long will it take? 
 - Around ten minutes?

162
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,690
- That fast?
 - That guy knows everyone.

163
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,380
Who is he? Is he in your class?

164
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,700
Come on.  Have you seen any cop who reveals his informant?

165
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,560
You must be joking. Are you practicing well? You're completely tone-deaf.

166
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,810
Hey, I'm the visual member.

167
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,720
I'm at the center and the main vocalists and dancers are my both side.  Okay?

168
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,910
You will snap out of it when you get 1 million haters.

169
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,550
Having a lot of haters shows how popular you are.

170
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,930
Oh, it's Park Seok Min!

171
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,350
Oh...

172
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,430
What's gotten into you? You're usually not fazed by handsome guys.

173
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,060
That looks really delicious.

174
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,800
What?

175
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,880
That's super expensive.

176
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,910
Go ask to share some with you.  Since you are in the same agency, you must be close with him!

177
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,510
You're so embarrassing, stop!

178
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,600
Aish, he left!

179
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,710
Ah, really! Enough!

180
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,990
You know people are a mess right? You're such a mess.

181
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,040
Uh, he said he doesn't know very well. Now I have to leave.

182
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,600
Don't ever go into acting.

183
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,250
This crazy!

184
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,270
One didn't come.

185
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,920
He's almost here.

186
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,660
Mother-in-law.

187
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,470
Since Kang Woo is here, should we grill Korean beef?

188
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,570
Do you want to eat it?

189
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,670
Not really.

190
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,810
Aish...

191
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,680
I want to eat it! After eating only American beef,  I want to eat Korean beef.

192
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,480
Then grill it, Mother-in-law!

193
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,350
Stay in your seat.

194
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,920
- What are you doing, Son?  
 - Oh, yes.

195
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,590
I'm so honored.

196
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,120
Ah, yes.

197
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,860
Get a lot of meat.

198
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,900
Everything here are vegetables.

199
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm sorry for coming late.

200
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,610
You're here!

201
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh, you're here just on the right time!

202
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,910
You somehow look skinnier.

203
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,440
Really? I'm not, though.

204
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,300
Min Hyeok, wait for a little. Your uncle will make delicious Korean beef!

205
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,440
Okay.

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,770
How about your dad and mom?  Are they alive?

207
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,040
Yes, they're building a school in Kenya.

208
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,530
They're doing such not making money stuff.

209
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,840
Since at his young age, he has always been something.

210
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,690
Hyung and his wife are such good people, you know?

211
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,420
You must be happy because your older brother had no interest in the company.

212
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,900
Later, when I die, it will be all yours.

213
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,320
Mother, really? You'll live longer than me.

214
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,210
Min Hyeok, the Korean beef! Eat a lot.

215
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,860
I'll grill the meat.

216
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,540
That's enough! Just sit down.

217
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,910
Mother, I've only just grilled one slice.

218
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,730
If you eat a lot of meat, you'll get unhealthy.

219
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,310
Turn off the stove.

220
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,180
You guys should repay all the investment I've made on you.

221
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,460
Min Hyeok, how long will you work in school?

222
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,350
You're wasting all your talents away. What exactly are you doing?

223
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,810
Mother, let's let the kids eat first,

224
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,530
and–

225
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,340
You. If you don't like being a doctor, come to the company.

226
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,740
You too, Kang Woo. I won't tell where to work, so

227
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,910
you should join where you can do well on your own.

228
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,170
Now, let's eat.

229
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,020
Yes.

230
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,050
Enjoy your meal.

231
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,020
Mother, if you eat a lot of meat at once,  you'll get indigestion.

232
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,760
Don't worry about me.

233
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,610
You're taking two slices at once.

234
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,160
Honey, can't we grill some more?

235
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,410
I'm glad that I'm not the only one who is going against Grandma.

236
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,260
What happened to you? She used to adore you so much.

237
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,460
Aish, that's what I'm saying.

238
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,780
Do you have a girlfriend?

239
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,420
- No. 
 - Do you have someone you're interested in?

240
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,370
You do, don't you?

241
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,080
You still can't lie. Can you?

242
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,600
Yeah.

243
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,350
You haven't changed one bit either.

244
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,360
Oh? What about me?

245
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,060
What's that? Someone looking like that is coming in here.

246
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,480
Why? What's that?

247
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,270
Aish.

248
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,530
- Is it okay if I check myself? 
 - We have customers. Please leave.

249
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,610
What's going on?

250
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,110
I'm sorry for the commotion.

251
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,030
Please leave.

252
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,760
- She's with me. 
 - What?

253
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,790
What's going on?

254
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:02,200
Joo Hee... Lee Joo Hee in grade 2, class 4 is working here.

255
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,800
Is it true?

256
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,240
Well, we didn't know she was a student. She bought a fake ID.

257
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,340
Is she here right now?

258
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,940
No. She quit two days ago.

259
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,790
You didn't cut her pay, right?

260
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,500
What?

261
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,280
You gave her what you promised (the correct amount of money), right?

262
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,580
If I confirm that you withheld some money from the student, I'll be coming back.

263
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,160
Please excuse me.

264
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,110
This isn't a bad bar.

265
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,290
It'd would be same if a student is working at a bar.

266
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,560
Thank you for helping me.

267
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,670
That...

268
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,380
It's about the flower that the vice-principal takes care of.

269
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,950
It's not like you were lying anyway.

270
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,310
Can I drive you home?

271
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,990
Didn't you drink?

272
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,230
Don't forget to call a substitute driver on your way home for sure.

273
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,930
Ah!

274
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,710
How did you get in here?

275
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,810
Your mother gave me the passcode.

276
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,020
Are you happy spying on me?

277
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm doing it all for your sake.

278
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,650
It's a new contract.

279
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,840
It's for one year. Just like you wanted, you have complete freedom. It's perfect, right? Sign it.

280
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,710
After taking a shower, I'll check it again.

281
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,700
You jerk. Does everyone you know, deceive you?

282
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,070
Do you think I would trust you?

283
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,640
Thanks to you, I'm nearly about to work for my grandma.

284
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,460
Ah, that–

285
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,610
By the way, are you really not coming tonight?

286
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,500
I said I'm not going.

287
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,540
Look at your body and your face. Don't you want to brag about it?

288
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,140
Don't you want revenge?

289
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,210
Childish.

290
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,940
Butt Hole.

291
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,140
Poop Shooter.

292
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,010
Extreme obesity.

293
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,050
 Oh, I think it's really stinks.

294
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,000
 You smell like poop.

295
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,260
 Hey, he really pooped all over.

296
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,030
I don't care.

297
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,970
That's good.

298
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,490
Are you okay?

299
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,500
Stay here.

300
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,820
Who?

301
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,850
Dr Smith of New York Medical recommended you to me.

302
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,060
He said you went Stanpord University together and you were the best psychologist.

303
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:35,800
Pardon? The visiting hours for today...

304
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,330
I think you'll be able to make time even when you don't have it.

305
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,740
Please sit down.

306
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,500
Oh, not here. Over there.

307
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,910
Okay.

308
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,230
 Lee Kang Woo = Goes Poop

309
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,470
So if you're reminded of this, you get diarrhea.

310
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,040
What?

311
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,070
No, what's that...

312
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,470
Because of irritable bowel syndrome, it caused you to have diarrhea.

313
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,700
Yes.

314
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,170
Who is this?

315
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,130
I don't know.

316
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,710
I end up drawing her subconsciously. But I can remember her face.

317
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,820
What should I do?

318
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,850
Is treatment possible?

319
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,000
It's a dog-like situation.

320
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,830
What?

321
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,720
I was bitten by a dog once, so I came to hate dogs.

322
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,360
But now, I like dogs more than anyone else.

323
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,310
You, Lee Kang Woo, are in this dog-like situation.

324
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,520
I purposely raised a dog.

325
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,920
To get rid of my dog trauma.

326
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,420
One way to overcome trauma

327
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
is to face the cause of it.

328
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:47,570
Then... Are you telling me to meet the people who bullied me?

329
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,580
Giving it a try, at least one, wouldn't hurt.

330
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,350

331
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,820
Ma'am, isn't there a fire?

332
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,290
Ventilator just broke down. I'll get it fixed in a bit.

333
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,330
Just wait.

334
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,850
The smoke is hurting my eyes.

335
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,590
Hey! Cheers to our class!

336
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,890
Cheers!

337
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,160
How can you eat meat in this situation?

338
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,790
Ah, you don't know the way. If you want to say you ate meat in a meat restaurant,

339
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,800
you can eat a bowl of rice with the meat fumes in your clothes when you get home.

340
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,100
You don't know anything about this kind of stuff.

341
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,200
That's correct.

342
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,970
Who in the world would take you (marry you)?

343
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,550
Whoever would be, just a poor man.

344
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,610
Take me? What do you mean take me? I'm going to take him.

345
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,950
You're funny. It wasn't too long ago that you begged me to go on one date with you because I'm a teacher.

346
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,660
- Oh, that was– 
- You're ruining the taste of the meat, so can you go over there?

347
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,060
Leave. Leave!

348
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,850
You're not going to leave?

349
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,660
Let's eat.

350
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,250
Dammit. Where on earth is Joo Hee?

351
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,200
Eat this. Let's eat and look, okay?

352
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,970
That's right. Let's eat to get strong.

353
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,140
Ma'am! Can we get two more orders of meat here?

354
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,790
 Mapo Choi Dae Po

355
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,760
Okay. Where are you?

356
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,590
 Me? At work.

357
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,970
What? You said to go to the reunion!

358
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,060
 You said you weren't going, so I didn't go either!

359
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,910
 You really went?

360
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,640
Hang up!

361
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,700
 To overcome your trauma

362
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,240
 one way is to face the root of your trauma.

363
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,390
♫  If you want a lover  ♫

364
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,960
♫  I'll do anything you ask me to  ♫

365
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,630
♫  And if you want a doctor  ♫

366
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:23,670
♫  I'll examine every inch of you  ♫

367
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,670
♫  If you want a driver, climb inside  ♫

368

♫  Or if you want to take me for a ride  ♫

369
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,660
♫  Or if you want to take me for a ride  ♫

370
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,090
♫  You know you can  ♫

♫  I'm your man  ♫

372
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,110
Who is that? He's so late. How can he just waltz in here like this?

373
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,660
Who are you? I haven't seen you before.

374
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,850
- I'm Lee Kang Woo. 
 - Lee Kang Woo?

375
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,590
Butt hole?

376
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,280
That's me.

377
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,310
America? So that's why this is my first time seeing you.

378
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,850
Then, what do you do now?

379
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,890
I plan to take over the family business.

380
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,310
Business? What kind of business?

381
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,860
- Well that's– 
 - Ma'am!

382
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,850
Another two-person serving here!

383
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,180
Is this really?

384
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,550
- So you know? That this watch is 20 million won– 
 - Ma'am!

385
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,500
More onion salad!

386
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,410
You girls haven't changed much.

387
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,810
You became really cool.

388
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,420
Are you married, by any chance?

389
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,750
I have–

390
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,290
Ma'am, it looks like you'll have to switch a grill! The smoke is too much.

391
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,620
Hey!

392
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,300
Hi. I'm Lee Kang Woo. Who are you?

393
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,550
I don't remember your face well.

394
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,530
So you're Lee Kang Woo.

395
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,300
I was your first love.

396
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,480
What?

397
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,870
 I don't like you.

398
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:14,070
 You're ugly, and

399
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,770
 fat, so I don't like you.

400
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,430
You, you...

401
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,250
You!

402
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,300
That's right. That was you!

403
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,820

404
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,480
 Love With Flaws

405
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,160
 Love With Flaws

406
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:12,960
♫  I came to meet you by chance, and I fell in love with you  ♫

407
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,500
♫  I didn't realize that day by day, time was passing  ♫

408
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,610
 Love With Flaws

409
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,000
 That fat guy became a completely different person. He became so cool.

410
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,750
 It's written all over his face. C-H-E-A-T-E-R.

411
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,030
 A butt hole will always remain a butt hole.

412
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,820
 Why is that guy a butt hole?

413
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,590
 So embarrassing...

414
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,390
 Joo Seo Yeon!

415
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,410
 If it wasn't for her, that wouldn't have happened to me!

416
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,120
 The diarrhea you're sick and tired of.

417
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,020
 - you can be cured of it after you overcome this woman.
 - Hey!

418
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,250
 Stop saying ridiculous things, and go poop.

419
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,480
 I thought you changed, but you didn't change at all.

420
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,970
 Are you blind? I completely changed!

421
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,630
 Why is he doing that with his eyes?

422
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,610
 He looks like a dead fish.

423
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,730
 Instead of getting over her. I'm going to get my revenge.

424
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,210
 Joo Seo Yeon, do you want to date me?
