1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,640
You... you!

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,100
That's right. It was you!

3
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:40,690

4
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,720
Hey!

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,980
Are you okay?

6
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,380
Why's he like that?

7
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,010
This is not it.

8
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:58,150
♫  In my heart, in my soul  ♫

9
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,400
♫  I really hate to pay this toll  ♫

10
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:14,320
 Thanks!!! God!!! 
♫  Should be strong, young and bold  ♫

11
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,070
 Please.... God... 
♫  But the only thing I feel is pain  ♫

12
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,410
 Oh... My... God!!! 
♫  It's alright, we'll stay friends  ♫

13
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,170
♫  Trust in me  ♫

14
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,230
What are you over there? Why did you leave already? I came as soon as I could.

15
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,940
♫  And let's say it's just alright  ♫

16
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,560
♫  You won't sleep alone tonight  ♫

17
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,040
That's right. That could happen.

18
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,280
That could happen.

19
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,420
 Episode Three

20
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,330
Let's go for the second round!

21
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,730
Alright! Let's go!

22
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,430
You guys are coming too, right?

23
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,030
I don't think we can.

24
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,860
Just send her home and come with us!

25
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,450
How could I send her alone? Just go without me.

26
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,890
- What? 
 - Whoa, whoa!

27
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,970
She's causing a scene again.

28
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,650
Go, go, go, go.

29
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,930
We're leaving!

30
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,670
Bye! Bye!

31
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,470
See you later!

32
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,640
Have they left?

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,950
They left.

34
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,220
How much did you eat? You're super heavy.

35
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,550
All you had to do was say no. Why did you make me do all this?

36
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,670
Yah, I need to keep my image even if I had to say no.

37
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,010
Don't you know that they're chomping at the bit to be with me, who has this beauty and a teacher's job?

38
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,900
They should know their place.

39
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
Hey! You can be really irritating, you know?

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,980
Don't say anything to me!

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,110
You judge men by their looks. Just like you, I also judge men by their looks, capability and wealth.

42
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,630
You're going to drink one more round, right?

43
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,700
Let's go to my house.

44
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,840
Are you crazy? I can't meet your brothers looking like this.

45
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,620
Over my dead body.

46
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,670
My oldest brother is a gold digger, my second brother–

47
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,990
You know it, too.

48
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,120
Even though I can't date them, I still want to look pretty in front of handsome men.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,320
That's enough. Let's go to my place.

50
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,210
Your house is far away!

51
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,020
- My brother isn't even here yet! 
 - Let's go!

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,430
Come here!

53
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,570
It's so far.

54
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,270
Guys, have you been doing well?

55
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,380
Cheers!

56
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,430
Hyung! It's been a while.

57
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,560
I know.

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,240
- Have you been doing well?
 - Of course I've been doing well!

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,370
Why haven't you been coming lately?

60
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,590
Oppa!

61
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,430
Because of her.

62
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,340
Oppa! That time...

63
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,830
You're a scary kid, you know.

64
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,270
I heard you pulled my sister's hair.

65
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,240
No! Because you and your sister didn't look alike at all.

66
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,340
Do you have anything more to say?

67
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,570
You jerk!

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,440
Didn't you try really hard to win her heart over?

69
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,540
I need to get married soon, you know? I can't be fooling around forever.

70
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,320
Have fun.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,610
- Did you call for a driver? 
 - Ah, yes.

72
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,960
My car's coming in a bit, could you wait for a minute?

73
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,650
- Okay. Then I will smoke for a bit. 
 - Go ahead.

74
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,310
What are you doing?

75
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,160
Park it.

76
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,850
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

77
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,490
Hey!

78
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,650
Show some manners when you pay.

79
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,930
Don't you know even a trivial behavior shows your character?

80
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,490
Who was she?

81
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
#AlcoholOnALateNight

82
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,270
#SomeoneToDrinkWithMe

83
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,360
#Feelingsentimental.

84
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,550
It's done, let's eat.

85
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,190
So refreshing.

86
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,070
Didn't your mother come last week?

87
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,250
Yeah, why?

88
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,630
I mean if she came last week, wouldn't she have cleaned this whole area?

89
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,030
Why?

90
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,200
It's only been some days and your room...

91
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,730
Room? Is what?

92
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,160
Nevermind. Let's eat.

93
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,320
By the way, were you really Lee Kang Woo's first love?

94
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,830
I don't know if I was his first love, but he did say he liked me.

95
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,400
Really? So what happened?

96
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,310
I don't know. I don't remember well.

97
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,600
Come to think of it, he never returned.

98
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,540
That's probably true.

99
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,930
He's a weird guy.

100
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,430
Weren't you with him the entire time?

101
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,550
At first, I was flattered by his looks. But that's probably all he has.

102
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,550
Don't you know when you look at him? His face spells it out!

103
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,550
C-H-E-A-T-E-R.

104
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,630
Well, a butt hole will always remain a butt hole.

105
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,470
But why is he a butt hole?

106
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,060
Don't you remember our field trip?

107
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,430
I wasn't able to go then.

108
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,470
That's right.

109
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,450
Cheers!

110
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,480
So why do you call him butt hole?

111
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,150
Because that obese kid pooped himself.

112
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,930
Yes, I'm coming.

113
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,270
Who is it?

114
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,150
It's so late. You should've at least made an appointment before you came!

115
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,680
Not opening.  My foot! Foot!

116
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,530
That woman! It was all caused by that woman!

117
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,060
 I don't like you.

118
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:12,960
 You're... ugly and fat, so I don't like you.

119
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,740
 You're... ugly and fat, so I don't like you.

120
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,740
 Son! Eat your snack!

121
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,950
 Our son's favorite cake!

122
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,350
 That's okay. I'm not going to eat it.

123
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,320
 - W-Why, son? 
- I won't eat it.

124
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,420
 - Why are you being like this?  
- I'm not eating, I'm not eating.

125
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,190
 - Why are you refusing to eat?  
 - I don't want to eat it.

126
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,060
For nearly four days, I ate nothing.

127
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,330
Not even water.

128
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,720
 Oh, really?

129
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,360
 Hey, let's go.

130
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,660
What's even crazier is that after belittling a person like that,

131
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,880
I was suddenly contacted by her at night.

132
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,100
 I have something to tell you. What's your address? I'll go now.

133
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,960
What did she say?

134
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,370
 What do you think? Nothing. It's like she was playing with me.

135
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,690
After being humiliated and enraged, I couldn't hold it in any longer.

136
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,410
I wasn't myself so much so that I even forgot about the field trip the next day.

137
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,690
 - I told you— 
 - My arm!

138
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,800
It happened all the restrooms at the rest area were full that day.

139
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,560
I tried holding it in until we got where we'd stay.

140
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,770
 Oh, holy!

141
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,140
 What's that smell?

142
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,430
 Ah, really. Lee Kang Woo pooped!

143
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,630
 Ah! Who was it?

144
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,000
 Let's get away!

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,850
 I can't sit there.

146
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,570
So, the person in this drawing is...

147
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Joo Seo Yeon! If it hadn't been for her, the need for a diet,

148
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,760
and everything else could have been avoided!

149
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,270
Now, calm down.

150
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,570
Please sit down here.

151
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,890
You're suffering irritable bowel syndrome because of that incident?

152
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,870
Along with that, you have been having a hard time getting into relationships with women.

153
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,900
What?

154
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,980
Isn't it true? When I analyze what you've been saying,

155
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,620
since that day, you've never had any special feelings for other women.

156
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,180
You haven't dated a girl, right?

157
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,130
It's not that I couldn't date, I chose  not  to date.

158
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,260
Why? You're so handsome and impressive.

159
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,750
So wouldn't you think that I would wait for the perfect girl who fits me?

160
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,140
To a 15-year-old Lee Kang Woo, this girl was the perfect woman, and he was rejected.

161
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,950
You are still that same 15-year-old boy.

162
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,300
You have the fear of getting rejected again. You have locked yourself in there.

163
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,300
Do you understand?

164
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,560
The diarrhea you're sick and tired of,

165
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,570
you can be cured of it after you overcome this woman.

166
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,460
Aigoo... Your skin is so sensitive and yet you piled on the face make-up.

167
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,000
- You're pretty even if you don't put that stuff on. 
- Hey!

168
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
That startled me!

169
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,710
If we aren't married by 40, we should just live with each other, okay?

170
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,120
Here, this is a ring!

171
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,140
I got it, so go to sleep.

172
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,460
Are you crazy? Did you drive here after drinking?

173
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,860
No...

174
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,280
How could this be? How could my oppa do this?

175
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,900
Do you even know what you did?!

176
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,650
I used a substitute driver and I was just sleeping in the car and now I woke up.

177
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,560
You're not the only one who suffered. I suffered the same as you.

178
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,430
I can be a jerk, but how could I?

179
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,320
For real, right?

180
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,390
Have people always lied to you?

181
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,290
Did you drink?

182
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,100
Yeah. I drank a lot but seeing you made me sober.

183
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,430
Our youngest must be alone right now.

184
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,500
Why did you come home so late? I was so scared that I could die!

185
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,540
Hey! Hey! You're scarier.

186
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,700
It's like you don't know the electricity bill exists!

187
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,470
Is money the problem right now? I'm telling you that I was scared!

188
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,430
Of course, money is the problem!

189
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,330
I'm going to sleep first.

190
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,050
I called you, but you didn't answer. And you always freak out when I don't answer your calls!

191
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,300
You called? I'm sorry, I didn't hear it.

192
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,910
Ah really.

193
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,870
By any chance, did you hear anything more about Joo Hee?

194
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,380
Ah, I don't know!

195
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,520
She'd get into trouble because of her attendance.

196
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,790
Stop and go to sleep.

197
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,410
No... I was asleep earlier,

198
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,220
but I couldn't sleep because no one was here. Now I can't fall asleep.

199
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,980
Oh, yeah. About Park Seok Min.

200
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,760
- Who? 
- You know, the guy who brought the expensive cake.

201
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,660
Oh, the cake guy? What about him?

202
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,060
I heard the second brother talking on the phone.  It seems he is a regular customer at the second brother's bar.

203
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,480
- Really? 
 - Yeah. Isn't it awesome?

204
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,790
You. Don't ever dare to tell people this.

205
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,930
Am I an idiot?

206
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,060
Only handsome guys drink at second brother's bar.

207
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,370
Isn't it clearly discrimination?

208
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,780
Racism is not the only discrimination.

209
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,770
But, Noona.

210
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,170
You smell.

211
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,420
Here you go.

212
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,640
Ah, really! Stop doing that!

213
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,920
♫  It's pretty clear that I'm not over you  ♫

214
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,230
♫  I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do  ♫

♫  Can you light the fire?  ♫

217
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,330
♫  I need somebody who can take control  ♫

220
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,480

221
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,080
Uh, please g-give me beer.

222

224
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,090
Are you here for a scoop?

225
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,780
What?

226
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,350
Or did you hide a hidden camera? To upload this to the internet?

227
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,890
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about.

228
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,290
You came here knowing that this is a gay bar. Am I wrong?

229
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,600
You're right, but I just came here to have fun.

230
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,550
I'm only saying this because you seem like a younger brother to me, but you don't fit in with this place.

231
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,300
If you look, you'll see.

232
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,820
♫  But, boy, I need to get you off of my mind  ♫

233

234
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,830
I'll give you this on the house, so drink and leave.

235
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,240
No, it's nothing.

236
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,680
So, what are you going to do?

237
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,700
♫  Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new  ♫

238
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,010
♫  I'd catch you if you fall  ♫

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,590

241
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,310
♫  Put you right back on your feet  ♫

242
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,150

243
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,660
♫  Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there  ♫

244
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,790
♫  Feeling so high but too far away to hold me  ♫

245
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,510
 The diarrhea you're sick and tired of, you can be cured of it after you overcome this woman.

246
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,880
  You can be cured of it after you overcome this woman.

247
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,720
  You can be cured of it after you overcome this woman.

248
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,250
  You can be cured of it after you overcome this woman.

249
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,990
That's right! You said I was ugly and fat, so you didn't like me!

250
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,540
Joo Seo Yeon... Now it's my turn.

251
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,760
Just you wait!

252
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,950
Oh my. Funny running into you here.

253
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,030
Were you still unable to find Student Lee Joo Hee?

254
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,590
Yes.

255
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,510
I asked boss at the wine bar again just to make sure, and she really did quit.

256
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,260
Thank you for caring.

257
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,930
Oh, here.

258
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,220
Do you want it?

259
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,810
It's really delicious.

260
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,870
By any chance, if you're doing this because of the flowerpot incidence–

261
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,040
That's not it. I thought it would be good to share it because it's so delicious.

262
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,170
With me?

263
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,750
Yes.

264
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,510
What's that? What's that?

265
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,980
Is that jerk giving the sickness and the medicine? He keeps surprising people.

266
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,910
You should eat this.

267
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,560
Is that how she's interpreting this situation?

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,030
I told you to choose a department to work in but you haven't given me an answer yet.

269
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,150
Not sure.

270
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,100
I knew this would happen.

271
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,170
Here. With your qualifications, all these places are available for you to join.

272
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,470
Just choose one.

273
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,000
 Which one should I pick —

274
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,410
You really!

275
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,220
There are many other people qualified more than me. You have my sister, your right-hand.

276
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,520
Is it okay for a person to only have their right hand?

277
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,270
He should have a body with legs and arms and five viscera and six entrails.

278
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,150
Grandmother, I have other things I want to do.

279
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,110
Can't you just leave me to do those things?

280
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,750
Just because people want to do things, it doesn't mean they will be good at them.

281
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,700
I've seen many people ruin there lives by following only what they wanted to do.

282
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,390
Whether I get ruined or succeed, I'll bear it.

283
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,110
This little—

284
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,340
Mother-in-law. He is more stubborn than we thought.

285
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,080
Move on to Plan B.

286
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,230
Excuse me? I can hear everything.

287
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,110
What's Plan B?

288
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,970
Be in charge of one of these places and keep it going for a year.

289
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,700
Afterward, I won't meddle with your life.

290
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,520
Grandmother!

291
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,400
Can't you invest one year and get the freedom of a lifetime?

292
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,920
Or do you not have confidence?

293
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,110
You promised, okay? One year!

294
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,050
I'm leaving.

295
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,280
Okay, son. Goodbye!

296
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,120
Mother-in-law!

297
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,140
For now, we have gained one year. Within the year, we'll get him married and make him stay.

298
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,210
Yes. I'll search the bride candidates very hard.

299
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,960
Aren't the midterm evaluations really important?

300
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,840
- Is it so? 
 - Our CEO will be there at the midterm evaluation.

301
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,420
Really? I haven't seen the president a single time!

302
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,460
I'm sure there aren't many people who've seen him.

303
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,740
They said they would pick the debut team after evaluating us.

304
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,680
What are you worried about, with your good voice? You're definitely a main vocal.

305
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,050
In this field, you can't succeed only with a good voice.

306
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,370
If I had a quarter of your handsomeness...

307
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,570
Hyung!  Don't you know about a make-up effect or cosmetic surgery?

308
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,680
Don't worry, don't worry.

309
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,380
Alright. Other than the face.

310
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,780
Since I'm better than you at singing and dancing.

311
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,890
Wow. You're dissing me outright.

312
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,090
I was joking.

313
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,750
Hyung, do you want to go to practice first?

314
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,880
- Why? 
 - I'll meet someone for a moment and then go.

315
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,280
- Who? 
 - Well... That...

316
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,420
It's my private life.

317
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,440
- Okay, I got it. 
 - Bye.

318
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,710
You're Lee Joo Hee, right? I'm Joo Seo Joon in the same class as you.

319
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,250
I know. Is there anyone in the school that doesn't know you?

320
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,680
Well, I am a little popular—

321
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,900
You like to show yourself off so much.

322
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,560
Do you know my sister is Joo Seo Yeon?

323
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,670
- My sister is looking for you. Please call her.  
- Don't mind someone else's business.

324
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,770
She mentioned your attendance or something.

325
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,280
Mind your own business.

326
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,000
You think it's because I care about you?

327
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,360
- You ordered chicken, right?  
- Huh?

328
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,420
A girl is delivering.

329
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,420
What does a girl or a boy matter with a delivery?

330
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,170
Do you want to eat together?

331
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,710
It's boring to eat alone.

332
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,580
You ordered that much to eat all by yourself?

333
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,350
They all taste different. I want to take a bite out of each.

334
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,540
Eat with me before you leave.

335
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,290
It's okay. That'll be 73,000 won  (~ $61.78).

336
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,300
It tastes good, though.

337
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,890
- Tip. 
 - What?

338
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,480
I didn't want to carry around change.

339
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,510
- You brat!  
 - Oh, no...

340
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,790
I asked the store where you delivered.

341
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,270
Follow me.

342
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,440
I don't want to!

343
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,300
Ha! Did you push me just now?

344
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,500
You were doing it forcefully.

345
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,570
You grew up a lot since we last met.

346
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,090
What, what, what, what?

347
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,880
- When your teacher said— 
 - It really hurts!

348
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,180
It really hurts. Ah!

349
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,680
Hey! Just listen to me!

350
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,050
It hurts! It really hurts!

351
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,600
Teacher!

352
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:53,320
She was your teacher? I thought she was a thief.

353
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,250
Is she dead?

354
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,220
She's breathing.

355
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,730
Then should we go to a hospital?

356
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,010
She is not the one who would go wrong with a blow.

357
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,780
Teacher, are you okay?

358
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,160
Why am I being like this?

359
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,820
That was...  I thought a bad person was bothering a delivery person.

360
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,520
Sorry.
