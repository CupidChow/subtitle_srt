 Episode 14

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,490

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,930
It seems he is still at home.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,930
Sorry! Sorry!  I see it's your territory. I'm sorry.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,170
What are you doing?

6
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,040
H-hello.

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,800
You didn't get in to try to avoid me by chance?

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,760
I'll keep it confidential!  Please trust me.

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,860
That punk, really.

10
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,040
 I saw you and your feet seem to hurt a lot. Use these.

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,010
 Please wear this and go.

12
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,090
This person... to Unni.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,670
This person, also... to Unni.

14
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,260
But, these two... Friends...

15
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah, I don't know!  Why are there so many people around Unni?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,070
I don't have any space to cut in.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
Is there no other way after all?

18
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,850
Lee Joo Hee?  This student's records are good.

19
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,600
Joo Hee?  Right.  She is getting better.

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm pretty sure she would win in this competition.

21
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,970
The rest of them are so-so.

22
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,670
If they consistently practice, they'll be fine.

23
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,100
Let's wait and see for now.

24
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,290
Potato has grown up a lot.

25
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,080
Is that so?

26
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,780
Water is clean too.  You must take care of it earnestly.

27
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,170
If you want to take it back, please do so.  It's bothersome.

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,610
Have yourself anything you want from the refrigerator.

29
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,560
Really?  Good!

30
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,100
I was kidding, just kidding. Don't worry. I'm not sending you anywhere.

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,460
I see even the look of the rich's fridge is different.

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,110
What are you doing?!

33
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,650
You told me to have myself anything I wanted.

34
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,230
Even if I said so, you don't even cook those?

35
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,450
That's fine.  Once this gets in my stomach, it'll be all the same.

36
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,300
I have all kinds of food from fruits to milk in the fridge.  But out of all food, you picked up...

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,200
It tastes good.

38
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,710
How cheap you are by taking it back after allowing me to have it!

39
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,800
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

41
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,030
You can cook this kind of dish?

42
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,270
If you want to eat, you need to eat properly.  Enjoy yourself.

43
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,620
♫  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

44
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,010
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop whenever I look at you  ♫

45
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,970
Let's do business with me.

46
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,920
♫  What’s wrong with me? Since when?  ♫

47
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,160
♫  I'm like this whenever I meet eyes with you  ♫

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,290
How about you?

49
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,390
I'm fine.  Strict diet.

50
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,920
Hey!

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,700
Just have one bite, please.

52
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,340
♫  Without my knowledge, how can you  ♫

53
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,190
Does this used spoon bother you?

54
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,400
♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,340
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop  ♫

56
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,100
Delicious, right?

57
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,170
♫  Whenever I look at you  ♫

58
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,050
Hey, give it to me. You cooked so I should clean the dishes.

59
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,010
Leave it to me.

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,850
You're cleaning dishes very seriously.

61
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,630
Right.  It's good to try your best in doing anything.

62
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,310
Don't hang around me but go eat some fruits!

63
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,720
Wow, look at the visual of the fruit dish.

64
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,980
This fruit tastes as good as beef.

65
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,200
Yes? I sent the e-mail. Haven't you seen it? It can't be.

66
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,960
Yes. I just sent the e-mail again. Please confirm it.

67
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,730
Yes.  Then see you at the meeting.

68
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,830
Oh! You scared me!

69
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,980
Why are you here?

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,650
You told me to follow you.

71
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,940
- I meant you to stay there. 
 - I see...

72
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,000
Did it mean so?

73
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,010
I don't have any knowledge about these but it seems your clothes are very nice.

74
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,660
Well, they are not bad.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,630
But why aren't there any women's clothes?  You used to draw a lot of women's clothes.

76
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,250
Do you remember the clothes that you drew for me?

77
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,520
I still have—

78
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,340
Please leave now.

79
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,680
You're so good at drawing like this.  Why not?

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,290
Why do I keep seeing something?

81
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,150
Stop it.

82
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,590
Y-You are real.

83
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,740
Don't try to avoid me uselessly.

84
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,470
Do tutoring to the kids properly and on time, understand?

85
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,820
Yes.

86
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,000
On the day, at the bar,

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,680
I didn't like your gaze that seemed you had expected something a lot.

88
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,060
Don't mistake that all the minorities would be the same side.

89
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,180
If an individual becomes a group by gathering, there must be bad people among the group.

90
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,720
So you must've worried about me, right?

91
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,140
You must've protected me from bad people.  I didn't know that.

92
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,800
No, I mean I'm a bad person.

93
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm a bad person so don't keep what happened on that day in your mind.

94
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,780
Never mind.

95
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,090
And all of my family already know who I am so don't say to keep it confidential or something, okay?

96
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,930
How?!

97
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,430
How did you let your family know?

98
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,560
Is it Hyung Won Seok? Who is the guy?

99
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,200
Good job.

100
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,920
Are you not leaving?

101
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,990
Done?  You don't have anything else to ask me to do?

102
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,620
Wow, you have a lot of passion for work, Teacher Joo.

103
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,400
Who made me be like this?

104
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,300
I have an appointment later.

105
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,300
No, I'm going to go by myself.

106
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,280
Really, you can leave.

107
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,830
Huh?

108
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,600
Yeah.

109
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,600
Okay, see you tomorrow.

110
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,710
What happened?  He used to try making me drive no matter what...

111
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,180
Well, he is probably going to go someplace where he can't go with me?

112
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,330
Drink this.  It's a new bottle.

113
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,480
Maybe, he is going to go on a blind date again?

114
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,180
Only Joo Seo Yeon exists in this world or something?

115
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,470
Wherever I look, there is Joo Seo Yeon.  Joo Seo Yeon!

116
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,450
Yes?

117
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,200
 Are you on your way to me? You didn't forget your appointment, did you?

118
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,070
I'm sorry but I want to cancel today's session.

119
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,970
 Bus Stop

120
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,390
Get in.  I have a place to go with you.

121
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,260
How capricious he is!

122
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,900
♫  Tonight, I'm scared of the darkness  ♫

123
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,660
What is this?  I got scammed?

124
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,290
Ahjussi said this would catch the Korean well.

125
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,710
Should I have bought the 3 million won one, instead of the 2 million won?

126
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,890
Noona!

127
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,780
Noona!

128
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,840
Hyung!

129
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,070
Second Hyung!

130
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,160
 Mommy!  Mommy!

131
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,070
 Mommy!

132
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,970
Mommy.

133
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,110
Mommy.

134
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,900
Seo Joon!  Are you okay?

135
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,240
Mommy.

136
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,140
What happened to you?  Do you hurt?

137
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,920
Mommy.

138
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,060
Mommy.  Mommy.

139
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,530
- It's okay.  It's okay. 
 - Mommy.

140
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,970
Mommy.

141
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,670
Are you okay?

142
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,660
Hey, why are you—

143
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,740
Don't tell Noona.

144
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,650
It was my first time to go to the fabric market.  It was fun.

145
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,580
Was it fun?

146
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,380
Then you can drive there whenever I go to the market.

147
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,890
You'll have fun and I'll be comfortable.

148
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,140
I would rather die than complain about you.

149
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,940
♫  I already addicted to you, what's the use of telling you?  ♫

150
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,010
♫  If you touch me, my body is reacting  ♫

151
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,160
♫  I have to have you so I can live  ♫

152
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,290
♫  Every day, every night, I can feel you  ♫

153
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,790
I-I'm tired.

154
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,890
Yeah.

155
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,720
Okay.  When we get home, I'll wake you up.

156
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,200
♫  I may get pricked but I still want you  ♫

157
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,500
 I'm going to go crazy!

158
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
 Get it together!

159
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,280
Put your left leg and right leg to the side. And your hand

160
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,070
Nice!  One, two.

161
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,510
Just take the call.

162
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,850
Oh...okay, I will.

163
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,700
This is Lee Kang Hee. Oh, you sent the report?

164
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,770
I'll check in a moment.

165
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,350
Yeah.  How long has it been since you made her take it?

166
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,700
Then she'll probably wake up in the morning.

167
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,640
Bring her to Room 1405.

168
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,440
He's making me lose my appetite.

169
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,570
Oh, she is pretty heavy.  Almost here, you punk.

170
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,460
- He is at Room 1405? 
 - Yeah.

171
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,700
Okay! Let's go!

172
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,300
 She'll probably wake up in the morning. Bring her to Room 1405.

173
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,830
 - He is at Room 1405? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay.

174
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,100
Miss Lee Kang Hee!

175
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,950
Let's go!

176
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,190
Hurry up and go. Let's go!

177
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,280
- You, get out. 
 - Pardon?

178
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,490
You're the person, right?  LC car, valet tip, and character?

179
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,470
- Well, that's true but since it's urgent, let's go—
 - What the hell kind of acting is this?

180
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,720
- Acting? 
 - You want me to consider this situation as a coincidence?

181
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,760
Get out. I'll take the girl so get out.

182
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,560
I'm going to go crazy.

183
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,310
- Hey, who are you? 
 - Me? I'm her oppa.

184
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,370
Hah! That's bull. She doesn't have an oppa.

185
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,960
Then let's just say I'm her club oppa.

186
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,490
I'm just dumbfounded.  How dare you who looks like a fop interfere with us?!

187
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,140
If you as a man say to a man that he looks like a fop,

188
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,320
to girls, you're saying I'm really good looking.

189
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,070
Wow, you guys must be very happy. Your eyes, noses, and mouths show off on their own characteristic way.

190
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,860
Me? He? Or him?

191
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,140
This bastard...

192
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,490
 - We should go.
 - On the street—

193
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,420
Go.  I'll go by myself.

194
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,510
Are you crazy!

195
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,330
Are you crazy? You're drunk and you're trying to grab the wheel.

196
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,730
Drunk? This girl, I'm gonna—

197
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,720
Hurts.

198
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,880
Lawyer Kim, did you find out who he is?

199
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,050
 Fitness guy is the fifth child born to Baekga Co.'s CEO Baek Joong Gi out of wedlock.

200
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,600
 He is at the Gangnam police station for assault and battery.

201
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,740
Assault and battery?

202
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,250
Ah, it's really unbelievable.

203
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,400
Ah, seriously.

204
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,540
Do you know who I am?

205
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,350
I'll make you stay in jail for the rest of your life.

206
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,830
Calm down and sit.  Sit down.

207
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,710
You're not one of them.

208
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,310
Baek Kuk Hwa!

209
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,370
Who is that?

210
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,820
You know CEO Baek never forgives

211
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,520
if his children appear in the society section of the newspaper, don't you?

212
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,780
Ah, who are you?

213
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,820
This contains all of that woman's statement.

214
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,130
What are you going to do?   Should I just hand over to the police?

215
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,020
Or are you going to settle it quietly?

216
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,920
If you kept letting them slide like this, they would keep doing it.  You should've just handed it over to the police.

217
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,420
Sometimes, speaking works faster than law.

218
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,660
Yes, Department Chief Park. I'll send something to you.

219
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,870
Please call me after looking at it. Yes.

220
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,970
I didn't say I would not report to the media.

221
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,080
And don't worry about your friend.  Her parents came and took her.

222
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,150
Anyway, she doesn't have an eye for people.

223
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,820
How did you know those punks would do such a thing?

224
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,630
I could see those people who came for such a thing.  The look in their eyes is different from others.

225
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,180
So you followed them to the hotel and saved her?

226
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,620
I have plenty of loyalty.

227
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,120
Wasn't it like you agreed to do together then you changed your mind?

228
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,470
Ah, I'm going to go crazy.  My style is weird today?

229
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,960
Why do you consider me a guy as same as those guys?

230
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,520
You could report this incident to police at the spot right away but you—

231
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,840
If I reported this to police at the spot, I would be dead.

232
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,610
Club workers and business owners in this industry would attack me.

233
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,210
Even though I know her, she is not as close as I would risk my life.

234
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,950
If I had Shinhwa Food in my background, I might've done it.

235
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,790
Is it okay for you to speak about me so straightforwardly?

236
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,460
Anyway, when you saw me, even my bottom, why do I worry whether it's okay or not.

237
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,260
Don't worry.  I won't show up in your life from now on.

238
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,870
Anyway, thank you very much for today's help.

239
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,880
Lawyer Kim, I told you that you didn't need to be here.  Why are you here?

240
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,290
Ah, it's not for you.

241
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,550
I'm sorry at this late time.  They behaved dirtily so I called you.

242
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,950
No, it's fine.

243
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,840
That person can never drive again, can he?

244
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,700
No.  He's had his license suspended three times plus an assault charge.

245
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,080
If he still doesn't come to his senses, we can call him a human.

246
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,180
Thank you.

247
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,120
What are you doing?

248
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,810
Noona?  How can you be here?

249
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,490
I'm Lee Kang Hee.  Who are you?

250
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,220
Hell—

251
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,480
You don't need to know.

252
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,190
Thank you, Lawyer.

253
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,160
Then I'm leaving.

254
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:24,390
Lawyer Kim.  Please don't tell our parents or Grandma what happened to Kang Woo or me.

255
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,940
If they found out, we would get in big trouble.

256
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,320
Let's go slowly.

257
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,530
You want to see me going crazy, right?

258
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,930
How could you think about jumping into the car?  Moreover, in front of me?

259
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,590
Were you shocked?

260
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,010
While you were trying to prevent your ex-boyfriend from drunk- driving last time,

261
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:07,010
didn't you almost get hurt?  Why on earth did you do that?

262
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,930
Because I have to stop them.

263
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:15,920
So you—  Why do you have to stop them?

264
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,130
If there had been people like me, my mother and father wouldn't have die—

265
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,810
I'm going.

266
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,620
Thank you today and I'm also sorry.

267
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,170
What do you mean?

268
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,590
What happened to your parents?

269
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,150
Why are you eating Tofu all of a sudden?

270
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,640
I came back from a not-nice place.  I need to cleanse my soul.

271
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,430
Me too.

272
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,570
It's tasty.  What brand is it?

273
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,390
I don't know.  I just picked any brand.

274
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,010
Shinhwa Food?

275
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,700
- Ah really. 
 - Ah really.

276
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,550
Why you?

277
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,600
How about you?  Why were you saying it?

278
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,910
Just said it.

279
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,170
Me too.  I just said it.

280
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,390
Are you still dating your boyfriend?

281
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,850
He is not my boyfriend.  We had some kind of situation.

282
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,120
See?  Look at her.  I thought so.

283
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,350
There is no way you like a guy who looks like that.

284
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,150
What happened?  Should I go and beat him up?

285
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,340
Just tell me.

286
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,070
If I need to beat him, I'll beat him.

287
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,280
Wow.  Look at this sturdy fist.

288
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:19,190
Still, when you get tired while beating him up, call me.  I'll continue beating him.

289
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,120
I'll go to bed first.

290
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,290
Goodnight.

291
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,560
By the way, how could he say, "you don't need to know"?

292
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,760
He meant I didn't deserve to be introduced to his family, right?

293
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:57,760
 If there had been people like me, my mother and father wouldn't have die—

294
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,450
What is this unexpected meeting?

295
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,480
We are not in a relationship that we would meet up in the middle of the night?

296
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,160
I don't have anyone to ask a question except you.

297
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:26,830
Something happened... to Joo Seo Yeon's parents?

298
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,310
Why are you curious about it?

299
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,590
In middle school...

300
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,430
I think it was one day prior to our school trip.

301
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,790
 Goodbye.

302
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,220
 If you tie the shoes string like this, it won't loosen.

303
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,620
 Does he still live together here?  I'll say hello to him next time.

304
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,120
 They passed away together,

305
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,080
 because of a crazy drunk driver.

306
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,830
I haven't had a bad dream for a while.

307
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,530
It's not enough with my wrists,

308
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,620
now even my feet... I'm crazy.

309
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,900
 If I hadn't run, I couldn't have endured.

310
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,980
Lee Kang Woo?

311
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,460
 Don't call my name.

312
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,330
You're here to do exercise too?

313
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,500
 Don't talk to me.

314
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,050
 Don't smile at me.

315
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,060
Hey!

316
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,160
 I told you not to smile at me.

317
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,730
I'm sorry.

318
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,800
Huh?

319
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,300
A long time ago, these days,

320
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,670
now, and from now on,

321
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,360
I was, am, and will be sorry.

322
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,430
I'll make you concerned about me.

323
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,990
I'll get on your nerves.  I'll make you keep thinking of me.

324
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,060
What do you mean?

325
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,010
I'm sorry that I like you.

326
00:31:54,420 --> 00:32:01,390

327
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,840
 Love With Flaws

328
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,660
 Is it possible a guy, who always lied, can speak the truth?

329
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,650
 I don't like the handsome men.

330
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,330
 Why did you live like that?

331
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,600
 I'm going to show you what hell looks like!

332
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,160
 Who would do unrequited love these days?

333
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,980
 Obsession, possession...

334
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,350
 Why does this jerk keep calling me?

335
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,100
 I won't!  I won't!  I won't!

336
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,220
 After they compete fairly, the stronger should survive.

337
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,840
 Right.  He should follow him.

338
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,520
 Really, you do whatever you want to do, right?

339
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,920
 Why do you make me concern you?

340
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,500
 Why do you make me keep thinking of you?
