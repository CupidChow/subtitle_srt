 Episode 27

2
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,750

3
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,860
- Crazy bastard. 
 - What?

4
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,370
You still call yourself a human after that?

5
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,240
Are you talking to me?

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,340
I... I couldn't control myself.

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,410
I shouldn't be doing this to you.

8
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,100
I don't have the right to love you or receive love from you.

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,450
What are you saying?

10
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,650
I heard. Your parents...

11
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,460
The accident.

12
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,690
What?

13
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,140
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,710
It was all my fault.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,970
Kang Woo!

16
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,500
Lee Kang Woo!

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,110
Open the door! Let's talk!

18
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,030
Kang Woo!

19
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,080
Who was it?

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,240
Who told him?

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,680
Which one of you told Lee Kang Woo about my parents?

22
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,780
You!

23
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,310
- It's you, isn't it?! 
 - No!

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,030
I-I was going to but I didn't!

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,190
 ...it goes to the voice mail...

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,040
 Should I just tell Lee Kang Woo everything and get killed bravely?

27
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,400
 No, Seo Yeon told me not to.

28
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,070
 Let's hold it in. Hold it in.

29
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,960
Really?

30
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,940
Have I ever done something you told me not to?

31
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,720
No.

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,730
What the—  What is this?

33
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,380
I gave that to her.

34
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,660
Because Unni Seo Yeon missed Lee Kang Woo.

35
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,790
The criminal is you!

36
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,000
You idiot! This was taken in front of Lee Kang Woo's house.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,510
She went all the way to his house.

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,150
Baek Jang Mi.

39
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,110
I just went to give the photos.

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,060
 Who is it?

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,670
 I'm here because of Seo Yeon Unni's matter.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,470
 Excuse me!  Excuse me!

43
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,340
Lee Kang Woo isn't all that great, but it's better than you being sad.

44
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,630
Jang Mi, you did all that for me?

45
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,330
It seems like she is a stalker to me.

46
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,240
Then how on earth did Lee Kang Woo find out?

47
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,280
Who else knows besides us?

48
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,170
That's—

49
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,400
Then if it's not you then it's the younger oppa.

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,280
Where are you going?

51
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,850
To the second oppa so I can ask him why he did that.

52
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,570
No need to ask!  Just at a glance, I can notice that Won Seok unburdened you.

53
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,700
What?

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,200
Then without telling him why you've behaved like that, are you going to start with him again?

55
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,040
That is...

56
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,930
That, I don't know. I didn't think that far ahead.

57
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,980
Like as you contemplated and chose your way, he also should be able to contemplate and choose his way.

58
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,290
If that matter bothers him even a little bit,

59
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,890
so if he lets you go...

60
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,470
Even if so, it's not your fault.

61
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,030
That rascal is wrong in the first place. Understand?

62
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,070
 I don't have the right to love you or receive love from you.

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,150
♫  Meeting  by chance, a person who leaves me only sadness  ♫

64
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,060
♫  Becoming a small candle in my heart  ♫

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,190
Why is your facial expression like this?

67
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,600
Why you?

68
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,060

74
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,290
 Is it true?

75
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,180
 Is it really because of me?

76
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,300
 Joo Seo Yeon's parent's accident?

77
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,860
 Get a grip on yourself, I never said the accident was because of you.

78
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,170
 I said Seo Yeon was going through a hard time because of you.

79
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,940
 Joo Seo Yeon is crying because of you. Do you understand me?

80

♫  Like the small leaves falling on the ground  ♫

94
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,800
 Doctor Kim.

95
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,110
 Hello?

96
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,950
Lee Kang Woo?

97
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,770
 This is Lee Kang Woo's phone but I'm not him.

98
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,160
I just found this phone.

99
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,960
The owner is on their way to pick it up.

100
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,730
You're a good person, returning the phone to its owner especially in today's society.

101
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,900
Whether it's a person or an object, they all came from somewhere.

102
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,690
That's correct.

103
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,310
By the way, you have a very nice voice.

104
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,990
I feel like you also have good looks.

105
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,090
Thank you. Your voice is also nice to hear.

106
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,050
Then, I will call this number later again.

107
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,150
Okay. Then I'll say goodbye too.

108
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,600
 Author Kim Dong Gu

109
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,490
Excuse me, are you the person who picked up the phone?

110
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes. Lee Kang Woo?

111
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,870
I'm sorry? No, I'm Lee Kang Woo's friend.

112
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,520
I see.

113
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,160
Here.

114
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,450
Thank you. I don't know how to repay you.

115
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,570
No, the object is just returning to its rightful owner.

116
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,940
If you haven't eaten—

117
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,280
Shall we?

118
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,420
Are you really okay with just that?

119
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,710
There's a restaurant over there.

120
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,060
This is enough for me.

121
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,090
Then at least some reward money.

122
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't have money but it's not that I don't have shame.

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,610
Then.

124
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,720
Goodbye.

125
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,490
Thank you!

126
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,060
He seems familiar.

127
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,910
I found your phone.

128
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,540
Leave it at the door.

129
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,680
- Kang Woo. 
 - Don't call me like that.

130
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,770
I don't have the right to be called by you like that.

131
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Who am I so... You...

132
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,640
How could I to you?

133
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,800
I can't be...  I'm a bastard who can't be...

134
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,140
Lee Kang Woo.

135
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,950
Joo Seo Yeon. How—

136
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,490
Did my crazy hand unknowingly open—

137
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,730
Hey, why would you just let her stand there and not open the door?

138
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,710
You punk really!

139
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,830
Kim Mi Kyeong.

140
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,160
I really can't live because of my friend...

141
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,490
- Look at me. 
 - Tell me.

142
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,210
You're here because you have something to say.

143
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm sorry for acting however I wanted.

144
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,930
I'm sorry for only thinking about myself.

145
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,320
Why didn't you tell me?

146
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,720
I was scared.

147
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,520
I was scared you would act like this.

148
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,230
Then how scared do you think I felt?

149
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,750
I was afraid I would be abandoned by you.

150
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,930
After I was really abandoned by you,

151
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,820
how scared do you think I was?

152
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,670
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,540
But what's scarier is that I now understand.

154
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,490
I have to be abandoned by you.

155
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,450
Lee Kang Woo, it isn't like that. You know it's not because of you.

156
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,370
Is it really not because of me? You've never thought like that, even not by 1% of chance?

157
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,030
If that's true, then you wouldn't have wanted to break up

158
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,060
in the first place.

159
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,370
Kang Woo.

160
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,680
Go.

161
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,980
I said go.

162
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,140
Thankfully it's not raining today.

163
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,530
Are you on your way to Kang Woo's house or on your way back?

164
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,640
The middle.

165
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,050
I'm deciding whether or not I should go back or just leave.

166
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,670
Would you like something sweet?

167
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,810
You bought all that?

168
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,490
I didn't know what flavor you liked.

169
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,450
This isn't a meal. It's not dinner.

170
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,770
Why are you looking at me like that?

171
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,190
To be honest, I didn't really like you in the beginning.

172
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,220
Was it because of the Vice Principal's plant back then?

173
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,900
No, there's something else before that.

174
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,610
Why?

175
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,530
Because you're good looking.

176
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,440
Don't you like good looking people?

177
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,810
I'm sorry? Me?

178
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,710
You said that you look at faces a lot.

179
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,450
 What kind of person do you like?

180
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,990
 I look at faces a lot.

181
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,920
I meant I didn't like good looking people.

182
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,610
That's what that meant.

183
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,950
You're really different from other people.

184
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,610
Most people are curious as to why I don't like good looking people.

185
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,630
I am curious.

186
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,450
But more than why you hate them, I want to know why you came to like them.

187
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,990
Kang Woo is good looking. Why did you come to like him?

188
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,170
It might be because of you.

189
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,820
Whenever I was having a hard time, I was comforted by you, a good looking health teacher.

190
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,610
I said this was not dinner.  Why do you keep trying to finish up with me?

191
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,720
- Look, I— 
 - I like you, Teacher Joo.

192
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,960
How could you say something like that all of a sudden in this situation?

193
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,050
I can't lie.

194
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,900
I can't say I don't like someone when I do. I can't help it.

195
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,720
When I say I like something, I really like it.

196
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,930
Why would someone like you like me?

197
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,750
Then, why don't you like me?

198
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,840
That's—

199
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,390
You have nothing to say, right?

200
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,460
It's like that for me too. It's just my feelings.

201
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,070
I'm going to get going. I'm a little bit late.

202
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm sorry for taking your time. You were on your way somewhere, right?

203
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,190
Yes.  I was going to Hyung to pick a fight with him.

204
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,860
I see... What?

205
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,710
- Is that for me? 
 - It's mine.

206
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,870
- Just give me one. 
 - I don't want to.

207
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,070
- Why are you here? 
 - You were the one that asked why I wasn't here.

208
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,120
Why? Is the situation different from then?

209
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,400
Joo Seo Yeon was here, right?

210
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,150
How do you know that?

211
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:24,020
Let's clarify.  I like Teacher Joo so I want to try without any regret.  How about you?

212
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,030
Why are you hesitating?

213
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,020
I—

214
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,960
Are you pooping?

215
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,990
What?

216
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,000
What are you saying?

217
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,880
You're pooping because you have too many blessings.  What an asshole.

218
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,720
You punk, in front of my face—  Are you here to pick a fight with me?

219
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,490
Yeah.

220
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,260
You really are taking a dump, Lee Kang Woo.

221
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,110
I still haven't told my sister, so stop.

222
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,290
What, is there something you don't understand?

223
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,620
Yes.

224
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,610
Which part?

225
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,490
Everything. All of it! I don't understand anything in this world!

226
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,170
- Tutor! 
 - Yes?

227
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,280
I need to go to the bathroom.

228
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,800
Is there something Seo Joon is mad about?

229
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,240
I don't know.

230
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,740
 Why don't you know?

231
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,640
 If you don't know, then who does?

232
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,920
You haven't left for work.

233
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,580
- What are you going to do? 
 - Pardon?

234
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,170
Are you going to go hang out somewhere?

235
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,840
No, I have to do school work.  I have a lot of reports to write.

236
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,230
Really? Then get in.

237
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,490
I'm sorry?

238
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,020
I'll drop you off on the way.

239
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,520
I can just take the bus.

240
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,070
Thank you.

241
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,670
 Lee Kang Hee

242
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,870
Go in and do your work, don't wander around.

243
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,490
Okay.

244
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,000
Go.

245
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,450
Father!

246
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,760
Father, what are you doing? You didn't even call.

247
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,750
Why did you get so skinny?

248
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,270
What do you mean?

249
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,090
Are you eating well?

250
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,140
Of course. Let's go inside.

251
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,270
No, I made a reservation for a night bus.

252
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,540
There's nothing going on, right?

253
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,660
I believe in you.

254
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,540
My son has never caused any trouble.

255
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,590
Father.

256
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,790
Eat some sweet potatoes.

257
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,770
Father, why are you just leaving like this?

258
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:50,020
 Sweet Potatoes

259
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,200
- You really are a player, Joo Won Jae.
 - Pardon?

260
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,960
You made me come all the way here.

261
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,160
At that, on my way to work.  Am I not so good?

262
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,090
Are you rejecting me?

263
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,560
You should have run away when I gave you the chance.

264
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,640
I don't block women who come to me and I don't hold back women who leave.  But I blocked you from coming to me today.

265
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,630
I'm going to hold on to you if you try to leave. Will you be okay?

266
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,050
Are you confident you won't regret it?

267
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,170
- Do you want to kiss? 
 - What?

268
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,750
- You don't want to? 
 - Yes, I do.

269
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,320
I like to kiss.

270
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,710
But it's the morning and in front of my house... I'm just worrying it's a little embarrassing?

271
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,410
Have a nice day.

272
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,950
Awesome!

273
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,880
Hyung, Hyung! Make sure to grab onto her.

274
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,400
She seems really rich and she's super pretty on top of that.

275
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,380
You— Why?

276
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,990
Hyung. Have a nice day.

277
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,260
Come here. Come here!

278
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,410
Okay.  I decided to use the fabric that you faxed to me for now.

279
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,530
But the cost is a little high.

280
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,560
This is what our designer wants.  It'll be okay if we sell them a lot.

281
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,490
I'll expose these clothes through Park Seong Min's and High Seven's outfit at the airport first.

282
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,370
I'll let them wear these as their regular outfit for the internet live broadcast or some other occasions.

283
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,910
Yeah...

284
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm taking a dump right now, how is it?

285
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,080
- Good. 
 - Hey!

286
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,120
Do you know what I hate the most?

287
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,620
When people don't do their work properly because of their personal business.

288
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,260
Sorry.

289
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,610
I let it slide a lot. Let's do this properly.

290
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,580
Kim Mi Kyeong? Oh, right now?

291
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,600
Yes, of course!

292
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,150
Okay, just wait a little.

293
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,130
Where are you going? Aren't we having a meeting?

294
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,090
Is the meeting important right now? Mi Kyeong is calling me.

295
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,590
What does he mean wait a little? All I said was I would buy dinner next time.

296
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,510
What's this? Where did it all go?

297
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,110
No, I didn't eat any of it.

298
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,670
Then where did it all go?

299
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,100
He probably decided not to eat any more.

300
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,940
Why?

301
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,900
Did you reject him for good?

302
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,090
No, I haven't had dinner with him yet.

303
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,330
I don't know, is that it?

304
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,150
I don't think that's it. I don't know, what is it?

305
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,640
What is she saying?

306
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,480
But the health teacher is kind of petty.

307
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,530
I didn't see him like that but he really cleaned out the snacks just because he got rejected.

308
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,790
That's not it.

309
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,520
Looking at you, you're such blessed people for food.

310
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,490
Come here. You should have some too.

311
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,980
These are really high-quality snacks.

312
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,650
Where did you get all this?

313
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,590
The health—

314
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,220
Did the health teacher give you all this?

315
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,530
No, I just saw that there were a bunch of snacks at the health office.

316
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,320
What? You just took them all?

317
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Without even getting permission from the health— I mean the Chief Director?

318
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,800
What do you mean permission? Chief Director Lee is such a nice person.

319
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,070
He's not someone to say something about something like this.

320
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,740
That's right.

321
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,380
You are shameless!

322
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,620
Teacher, never put these at the health office but hide them here and take them.

323
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,550
I'm sorry?

324
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,050
I thought Seo Yeon would die to take them back from Vice-Principal.

325
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,440
He is very skinny but very strong.

326
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,380
By any chance, if your snacks are taken by Vice Principal again, tell me right away.

327
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,450
Make sure.  Then I'll get going because I have a class.

328
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,160
Right now, Teacher Joo was protecting me, right?

329
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,760
Somehow, you're the type of person that I'm bothered a lot with.

330
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,350
Teacher Kim Mi Kyeong, you can't like me.

331
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,680
What a crazy—  Pull yourself together and live!

332
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,590
You're smart but why are you always taken?

333
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,360
Are you still on my side?

334
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,450
More than Kang Woo?

335
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:23,420
I'm on Seo Yeon's side.  I'm on the side of someone that Seo Yeon likes.

336
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,420
I'm jealous of you two, who are the old friends.

337
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,490
Before Seo Yeon is my old friend, she is my savior.

338
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,400
As you know, my personality has a clear like or dislike. For that reason, I was an outcast in middle school.

339
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,860
But Seo Yeon played with me.

340
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:45,230
Although other students told her not to play with me, she said why she would do that and said she liked me.

341
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,430
So I'm absolutely on Seo Yeon's side.

342
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,820
If I had met Teacher Joo back then, it would've been nice for me, too.

343
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,190
Then I would've liked her first and for a longer than Hyung Kang Woo.
