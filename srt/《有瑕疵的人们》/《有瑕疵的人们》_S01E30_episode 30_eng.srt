00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,390
 Episode 30

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,370
 How is it? Isn't it a killer?

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,790
This doesn't look like it has any utility as underwear.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,620
Wouldn't it be better to just not wear anything?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,170
Oh, you're so tacky.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,460
You can see, but you can't see.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,040
Should I show you? Should I not? Don't you know?

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,230
It's fine!

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,230
I don't want to go that far.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,800
Come on.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,800
Let's leave work.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,720
Why do you think Lee Kang Woo hasn't contacted you since that night?

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,670

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,990
You girl.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,090
Isn't Baek Jang Mi a little weird?

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,560
How did she know Lee Kang Woo's address?

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,910
When she first came here was strange too.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,230
- The thing that worries me the most is that she's dressing like you. 
 - What?

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,450
She's acting like you!

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,750
Baek Jang Mi is acting like me?

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,510
Are your eyes blind?

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,780
I thought you weren't saying anything because you were preoccupied with Lee Kang Woo,

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,260
but you had no idea at all?

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,600
Why would Baek Jang Mi cosplay me?

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,220
That's what I'm saying.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,190
By any possibility, in order to replace you with her secretly,

27
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,920
the government might put her as a spy urgently? Something like that?

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,120
To protect the gene of the handsomeness of three Joo brothers at the national level?

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,330
Say something that makes sense.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,230
Your eyes are just the open holes?

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000
Baek Jang Mi?

32
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,580
Do you have to go this far?

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,570
Shut up. Joo Hee said she saw bundles of money in this bag.

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,470
No!

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,020
What do you mean no?

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,370
Trash?

37
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,520
It's not trash but it's my stuff!

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,630
These are my belongings, right?

39
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,550
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,290
These aren't even worth anything, why?

41
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,170
I wanted to become like Seo Yeon.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,740
I thought if I copied Seo Yeon, I could become like her.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,360
What is she saying?

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,620
Jang Mi.

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,120
Who am I that you would want to become like me?

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,660
To me, you're like my daughter, my younger sister,

47
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,360
an older sister, my mother, my grandmother, my ancestor, my son, and my husband.

48
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,330
What the heck is she saying?

49
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,920
I was always a useless brat.

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,580
But being here, I realized that I could be of help to someone.

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,030
What kind of help?

52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,300
- Lee Kang Woo's pictures. 
 - Lee Kang Woo's pictures.

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,360
Unni, I think it's time for me to leave this house.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,680
All of a sudden?

55
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,010
Jang Mi!

56
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,680
Wait so what is your real identity?

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,160
You're really going to leave like this?

58
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,230
The police were looking for you.

59
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,000
They're not the police, they're people my mom sent.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,900
Will you really be okay?

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,970
Don't worry, Unni. I'm stronger now.

62
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,870
Call us often, and come over to hang out.

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,220
Don't come too often though.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,150
No, not me, not me!

65
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,500
Go.

66
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,430
Jang Mi!

67
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,990
- Yes? 
 - I thought you said you were going home.

68
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,310
This is it—my house.

69
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,710
It's my building.

70
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,540
Paying rent was annoying so I just bought it.

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,570
Baek Ga Corporation's annual sales are —

72
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,120
I should be friendly with Baek Jang Mi.

73
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,260
You were just saying something about her being a spy.

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, it's Lee Kang Woo.

75
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,460
Hello? Yes.

76
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,830
Right now? Of course, I have time.

77
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,540
Okay.

78
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,040
Lee Kang Woo wants to meet?

79
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,320
Here.

80
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,150
No.

81
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,470
It bothers me.  Lee Kang Woo's family thinks he will break up with me.

82
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,790
Were you coming from the world of 1988?

83
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,070
Even if you're going to break up with him, and if your mind and body wanted it, you should do it.

84
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,130
No, I can't.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,390
Even if you withstand it, Lee Kang Woo won't be able to!

86
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,870
That frustrating girl!

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,010
♬  I love it when you call me señorita  ♬

88
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,130
♬  I wish I could pretend I didn't need you  ♬

89
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,080
♬  But every touch is, ooh la, la, la  ♬

90
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,230
♬  It's true, la, la, la  ♬

91
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,260
♬  Ooh, I should be running  ♬

92
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,880
♬  Ooh, you keep me coming for you  ♬

93
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,970
♬  Land in Miami, the air was hot from summer rain  ♬

94
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,640
♬  Sweat dripping off me  ♬

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,960
 Lee Kang Woo, are you crazy?

96
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,030
 I purposely met outside because of this!

97
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,820
 You should be ashamed!

98
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,910
What's wrong? Is there something wrong with the food?

99
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,590
No!

100
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,620
It's good!

101
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,270
Same!

102
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,540
Hello!

103
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,660
Your eyes are very murky.

104
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,720
First Oppa, now you're following me?

105
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,490
Following you?  I'm not that imprudent.

106
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,040
Weren't you the one that barged into someone else's house late at night?

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,490
That was—

108
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,530
Anyway, I'm here because I have a date with my girlfriend too.

109
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,160
Oppa, this is the first time I've heard you say the word girlfriend. Who is it?

110
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,320
Should I introduce her?

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,720
You're even introducing her?

112
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,370
She'll be here soon.

113
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,910
I see you're feeding her something expensive.

114
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,490
I have a lot of money.

115
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,290
Even if you have a lot, you'll probably have less than my girlfriend.

116
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,290
I wonder. I've never been screwed over by someone when it comes to money.

117
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,960
Oh, I just got here.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,050
I also just got here.

119
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,100
Come out right now. Come out.

120
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,390
Why?

121
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,920
Eat first.

122
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,230
Don't wander around and come home right after.

123
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,790
That's the first time I've seen him with that face. He must really like her.

124
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,190
 I'm saying I like her. What's so complicated?

125
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,670
Right. There's nothing to make complicated.

126
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,800
What's wrong? Is there something going on?

127
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,660
Joo Won Jae, I've never acted like this without considering the effects and after-effects and never been imprudent like this.

128
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,280
Do you want to get married?

129
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,510
- What? 
 - Think about it.

130
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,100
Don't think for too long though. I don't think there's much time.

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,250
Why didn't you come to tutor again?

132
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,020
Oh, I have a cold.

133
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,520
My father is really hale and hearty, right?

134
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,430
As soon as I told him everything in the video was true, his fist went flying.

135
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,720
My father is very built because he's been a farmer for a really long time.

136
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,730
He'll live for about 50 more years so maybe he'll accept me in 50 years.

137
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,110
Tell me.

138
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:23,020
I want to do something for you but I don't know what,

139
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,860
so tell me.

140
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,780
No. What more will you do for me?

141
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,910
You've already done so much.  No need to say that.

142
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,860
I want to do more for you.

143
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,510
Joo Won Seok, are you home?

144
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,060
I should put it back so he won't notice.

145
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,380
 Do you want to get married?

146
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,070
 Think about it. But don't take too long.

147
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,410
What's going on? Did she get caught by her family for dating someone like me?

148
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,270
He put this here flauntingly.

149
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,840
I ought to just rip it up.

150
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,110
We're home.

151
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,060
Not your house but mine.

152
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,320
Why?

153
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,960
No, just cause. Go home.

154
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,360
Okay, I'll go. Sleep well.

155
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,530
Huh?  Okay.

156
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,560
What was that? I didn't need it.

157
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,610
 Even if you withstand it, Lee Kang Woo won't be able to!

158
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,810
 You frustrating girl!

159
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,280
 I wore this just in case as you said...

160
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,620
You should be embarrassed!  Shame on me.

161
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,710
Hold it in Lee Kang Woo! If you're human, you should know to withstand it!

162
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,190
Joo Seo Yeon will get scared and run away.

163
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,460
Hold it in!  Hold it in!

164
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,590
Hold it in dammit!

165
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,160
No, it's nothing like that. It's a misunderstanding.

166
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,890
No, it's a misunderstanding.

167
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,460
♬  But it's killing me to see  ♬

168
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,210
I'll try my best not to like you anymore.

169
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,560
To not like you.

170
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,020
I'll try my best not to like you.

171
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,110
No, it's a misunderstanding.

172
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,530
I'll try my best not to like you.

173
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,510
Not to like you.

174
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,060
I'll try my best not to like you.

175
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,460
I came here with your uncle and aunt before.

176
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,690
Food tasted not bad.

177
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,020
Yes, it tastes good.

178
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,290
Min Hyeok.

179
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,550
About Joo Seo Yeon...

180
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,030
Do you like her?

181
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,600
If I did?

182
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,380
If you did, then I could help you.

183
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,190
Did you find it?

184
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,650
How is Student Seo Joon?

185
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,950
He consists of simple cells so his healing rate is tremendous.

186
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,070
- He is fine. 
 - That's a relief.

187
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,180
Teacher Joo, I'll apologize in advance.

188
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,890
I'm sorry?

189
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:47,810
I don't want you to hate me, but I think hate would be better than having no feelings at all.

190
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,420
What do you mean?

191
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm sorry.

192
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,850
Is something going on?

193
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,990
 010-0353-0614

194
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,550
Hello?

195
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,440
 Joo Seo Yeon?

196
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,690
Yes, that's me.

197
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,520
 I'm Lee Kang Woo's grandmother.

198
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,900
Yes, hello!

199
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,470
Look at this punk.

200
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,610
Since he was a trainee with a well-known face, the company's name is already being mentioned.

201
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
Tell Joo Seo Joon to come up.

202
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,580
I'm sorry? You're going to personally meet a trainee?

203
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,610
Is that so? Does it go against fairness?

204
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,250
What kind of bastard.

205
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,840
 Hey! Lee Joo Hee!

206
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,010
Joo Seo Joon?

207
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,350
Yes?

208
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,870
You saw it, right?

209
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,230
As of today, you are no longer a trainee of HS entertainment.

210
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,000
But—

211
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,600
When you cause public comments, the contract will be nullified according to the company policy.

212
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,930
You remember right? If you don't, you can go home and review the contract.

213
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,320
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,960
Don't you have an excuse or an explanation?

215
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,570
Who is she? The girl in the video.

216
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,210
If it's something we can take care of, we can resolve this.

217
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,360
So that I can live and she can be ruined?

218
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,680
Thank you for everything.

219
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,880
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

220
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,280
You startled me!

221
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,720
You saw the picture right? Does your agency know?

222
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,310
As expected, the great HS Entertainment fired me without any mercy.

223
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,680
You got fired? Why you?

224
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,560
If I didn't, then you would be damaged.

225
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,660
I've already become known in public so even if people say something, I don't care about it.

226
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,710
That's not it. I don't work at bars.

227
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,610
Did you quit? Hey, good for you!

228
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,580
Good thing you quit before Noona found out. If she found out, you would die.

229
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,540
You idiot!

230
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,640
I haven't worked at those places in the first place!

231
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,370
What?

232
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,090
 How frustrated do you think these cars are?

233
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,680
 They probably get jealous looking at the cars outside, don't you think?

234
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,490
 Are you frustrated with being in the company?

235
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,250
I see you ran away, Joo Won Jae.

236
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,510
 Joo Won Jae

237
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,290
Hello?

238
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,760
Let's do it. Let's get married.

239
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,700
What?

240
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,220
I want to be that breath of relief whenever you're frustrated.

241
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,250
So let's get married, Lee Kang Hee.

242
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,230
  What are you so deep in thought about?

243
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,280
 Are you thinking about me?

244
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,120
Teacher.

245
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,290
Would you like to have dinner with me?

246
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,260
Teacher Joo.

247
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,470
You know I can't lie, right?

248
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,440
Would you ask me?

249
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,090
Whether I can give up Teacher Joo?

250
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,670
Please ask me.

251
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,590
Would you give me up?

252
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,620
I'll try.

253
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,780
So that I won't like you anymore.

254
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,100
I think I can do it.

255
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,900
I'm sorry. Who am I for you to do this?

256
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,510
The time that I spent liking you was precious to me.

257
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,350
So please don't think like that.

258
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,840
Thank you for letting me like such a nice person like you.

259
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,790
Thank you for dinner.

260
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,850
Excuse me.

261
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,400
Can I hug you just once?

262
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,480
I've always wanted to hug you just whenever I saw you.

263
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,570
Yes. Please do.

264
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,480
Thank you, Lee Min Hyeok.

265
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,760
Let's see each other at school safely.

266
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,740
I'm sorry?

267
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,800
I think I might not be safe today.

268
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,260
Lee Min Hyeok!

269
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,580
- I'm going to kill you! 
 - Lee Kang Woo?

270
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,050
It was not what it looked like!

271
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,720
I said it was not!

272
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,370
Are you mad?

273
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,880
Why were you hugging him? Why would a man and a woman hug?

274
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,890
I told you why we did.

275
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,630
Why did you follow him?  You could've rejected him flatly.

276
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,690
Lee Kang Woo, if you continue being mad, I can't say something to you.

277
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,590
Say something to me? What is it?

278
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,510
I was on the phone with your grandmother earlier.

279
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,330
What? My grandmother? Why?

280
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,450
Did she say something to you?

281
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,720
Kang Woo.

282
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,600
She should have just talked to me. Why did she have to call you?

283
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,070
She said she would watch over us.

284
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,880
She said she's going to watch over us.

285
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,300
She told us to do well.

286
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,130
What? Why all of a sudden?

287
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,260
I'm not sure either, but that's definitely what she said.

288
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,180
She told me " Take good care of my Kang Woo."

289
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,200
 Regarding to Joo Seo Yeon...

290
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,520
 Do you like her?

291
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,270
 If I do?

292
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,290
 If you do, I can help you.

293
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,650
 No.

294
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,710
No, it's a misunderstanding.

295
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,180
No.  It's not like that.

296
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,290
It's a misunderstanding.

297
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,100
 No, it's not like that. It's a misunderstanding.

298
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,090
 Are you sure it's not it?

299
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,480
 You know I can't lie.

300
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,070
 Teacher Joo is a nice person.

301
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,090
 She is better than Kang Woo deserves.

302
00:27:54,090 --> 00:28:00,380
 So... Please don't give her a hard time.

303
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,130
Good thing I practiced.

304
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,850
What do you think? Do you like it?

305
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,830
Of course. It means they approved of our relationship.

306
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,580
So, that means

307
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,710
they approved, right?

308
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,270
Right.  But I don't think that your mom and dad approved yet—

309
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,550
I'll win against them.

310
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,110
H-How can you say who will win between parents and their kids?

311
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,520
- And it's not cert— 
 - I'm very certain.

312
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,750
I'm telling you I'm very certain.

313
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,430
Wait a moment! Wait a moment.

314
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,320
I need to go home and come back.

315
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,920
What?

316
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,720
Just a moment.  For a very short moment.

317
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,710
By any chance, if you're uncomfortable or don't like it—

318
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,990
No.  I really like it.

319
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,290
It's absolutely not like that!  Not like that.

320
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,070
That is...

321
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:12,350
Underwear... pretty one... Mi Kyeong...

322
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,450
Anyway, I'll go home and be back.

323
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,710
Joo Seo Yeon, are you a fool?

324
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,000
Do you think things like that matter to me?

325
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,930
I can't see anything.

326
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,920
Except you.

327
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,670

328
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:52,510
♫  It's weird,  I'm thinking of you too much,  it's more serious these days  ♫

329
00:30:52,510 --> 00:31:00,530
♫  My face is flushed again, it's weird anyway  ♫

330
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,650
♫  It does it more than a dozen times a day,  I think I've gone crazy  ♫

331
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,320
♫  I think of you all day  ♫

332
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,040
♫  It's worse at night than during the day—do you know how my heart feels?  ♫

333
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,830
♫   What should I do really?   ♫

334
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,200
♫  Thinking of you, again thinking of you  ♫

335
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,040
♫  My eyes are filled with you  ♫

336
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:30,300
♫  By any chance, I'm afraid you know how I feel, my heart's pounding  ♫

337
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,420
♫  Thinking of you all day   ♫

338
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,810
♫  Again thinking of you  ♫

339
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,980
 Love With Flaws

340
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,490
 Lee Kang Woo is really in love.

341
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,840
 Look at the real ring!

342
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,930
 Teacher, I'm sorry.

343
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,110
 I got into trouble.

344
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,580
 What are you talking right now?

345
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,360
 You should've rejected me.  You have less fun than I thought, Lee Won Jae.

346
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,040
 I clearly warned you when I stopped you from coming to me, didn't I? I would hold on to you if you left me.

347
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,970
 At times, I think there are things one must bury in one's heart.

348
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,930
 Therefore, Doctor you too, please let it go.

349
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,560
 I thought about it and we should have an opportunity too, right?

350
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,420
 I don't know how many years it'll take.

351
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,740
 Put me down!  It's tickling!

352
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,970
 She is having a good time.

353
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,620
 You didn't tell them yet that we're dating?

354
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,880
 It's too early to tell.

355
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,020
 What do you mean too early?  I'm getting insecure.

356
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,590
 I don't know.  I'm a little embarrassed.

357
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,540
 Am I embarrassing?  I'm worried about it.

358
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,750
 Then don't meet her.

359
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,080
♫  Again, thinking of you  ♫

360
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,100
♫  My eyes are filled with you  ♫
