1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,920
  2nd Class Room of 2nd Grade
 Picking a tablemate!! 

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,960
 Well, Let's wrap it up!  Take your seats! 

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,830
 Be quiet! 

4
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,750
 Can I sit here? 

5
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,390
 Joo Seo Yeon 

6
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,500
 Y-Yes. 

7
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,110
 Oh yeah! 

8
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,200
 Finally! I can take a seat. 

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,030
 It's hard. 

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,930
 Let's get along well. 

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,080
 Hey!  Lee Kang Woo! 

12
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,080
 Didn't you see me?  Why were you just passing me even though you saw me? 

13
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,120
 Ah, I'm sorry. 

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,110
 Hey, Hurry come here.  Come here quickly. 

15
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,290
 These are on sale, buy two, get one free. 

16
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,130
 I can eat two but I can't eat three. 

17
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,460
 Do you want to eat? 

18
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,280
 Let's eat. 

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,700
 Ah, you're eating well.  Let's be the snack-buddies. 

20
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,390
 My friends don't eat much because they are on a diet. 

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,250
 Okay.  Stamp, stamp. 

22
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,620
 By the way, what do you draw? 

23
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,800
 You always draw something during the class. 

24
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,110
 Wow!  You can draw this kind of stuff?  You want to become a designer? 

25
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,470
 Well...  Just... 

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,050
 You're so cool, Lee Kang Woo. 

27
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,640
 Wow, awesome. 

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
Lee Kang Woo.

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,160
Did you just stab me in the back right now?

30
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,590
Too close.

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,460
What?

32
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,650
You're too close!

33
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,990
Where are you going?  We need to finish what we were talking about.

34
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,690
Right.  Let's get along.

35
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,770
You're sincere, right?  You mean it, right?

36
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,150
Have you read the proposed budget for the track team by chance?

37
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,630
You can sign it off tomorrow, right?

38
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,460
- Don't follow me. 
 - Huh?

39
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,550
Yeah.  Okay.  I got it.

40
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,690
And earlier, it was not what you thought.

41
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,990
It hurts.  I did it because it hurt.

42
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,110
What's with him?  He is cooler than I thought.

43
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,940
What was that?  Was it arrhythmia?

44
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,930
Right.  I haven't had a regular check-up for a long time.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Ah, really.

46
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,790
Pardon?  He didn't pay?

47
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,820
No.

48
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,030
No, well...  A man who was this tall,  good-looking with a pale complexion,  and wore white shirts... didn't pay?

49
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,780
No.  He didn't pay this.

50
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,130
Oh gosh.

51
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,640
What?  Really.  Hurry call Chief Director in no time.

52
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,390
Ah really, this...

53
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,480
I don't know his phone number.

54
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,910
How can you not know his phone number when you're a chief of school affairs?

55
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,090
- Did you kill him? 
 - What?

56
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,400
Lee Kang Woo.  He disappeared all of a sudden after you left to meet him, without paying.

57
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,900
Tell me where you buried him.

58
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,730
Ah really.  I'm telling you that we ended up being on good terms.

59
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,150
What would you like to do?

60
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,440
Ah really... Do I have to pay?

61
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,490
Would you like to pay in a single payment?

62
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,810
No, I mean...

63
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,290
Don't you make them pay first when someone makes a reservation—   Let me pay in six monthly installments.

64
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,760
Please pay for it.

65
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,680
- I'm sorry. 
  - The amount exceeds the limit. 

66
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,390
It says the amount exceeds the limit.

67
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,200
 Episode 7 

68
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,920
You're telling me that another symptom showed up on you besides the irritable bowel syndrome.

69
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,750
Yes.

70
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,230
It seems like there are some other feelings left that are not a grudge or trauma.

71
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,620
What kind?

72
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,130
Detestation?

73
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,420
Contempt?

74
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,010
Bitterness?

75
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,130
Rebuke,  hostility,  hatred.

76
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,730
- Lov— 
 - No!

77
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,170
Well, think carefully.

78
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,940
You're getting nervous just by even looking at her, right?

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Nervousness is the most typical warning sign of all the feelings that I mentioned—

80
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,800
No!

81
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,330
Don't just deny like this—

82
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,730
It's not denial but it's an arrhythmia.

83
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,490
I see.

84
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,510
- Don't just conclude so firmly— 
 - No!

85
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,300
- Open your heart a little bit— 
 - No!

86
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,630
This is a problem you may rethink—

87
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,350
That's never it!

88
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,930
- Do you think of her? 
 - No.

89
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,950
- Then where to go out together? 
- No!

90
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,000
- Then you want to eat delicious food with her? 
 - No.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,990
- Thinking of her even when you're doing nothing? 
 - N~o!

92
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,050
- No, what I mean— 
 - What is it?

93
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,020
- It's not what it is. But something of her— 
 - No.

94
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,220
- Something of her comes to your mind? 
 - No.

95
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,420
- Right now— 
 - No.

96
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,770
- Right now, you— 
 - No.

97
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,690
- Damn it. 
 - What did you say?

98
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,320
- Why on earth did I do that? 
 - Sorry?

99
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,270
I told you all night long.

100
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,780
- Lov— 
 - No, that's not it.

101
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,830
Why did I do it?  I'm really curious.  Why did I?

102
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,320
Yes, right.

103
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,520
It seems that sudden stress caused a strain on your heart.

104
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,670
I know, right?  As I expected!

105
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,130
Go quickly and have it tested.

106
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,890
Yes.  As I expected, that's it.

107
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,000
That immature rascal.  He is so stubborn.

108
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,520
- You don't have any problem with your heart. 
 - Pardon?

109
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,300
It's impossible.

110
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,000
For sure–here... There must be a problem here.

111
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,640
There is a story that a grandfather of the great-grandfather of mine died with heart disease.

112
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,180
Heart disease also runs in the family, doesn't it?

113
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,750
Don't worry about it.  You don't have any problems.

114
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,550
The result of the blood test is also good.

115
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,050
- You're healthy. 
 - No!

116
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm telling you, I'm not healthy.

117
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,100
Really, even this little...

118
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,510
No, no.  Is there even this little of a problem?

119
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,990
Well... Then your cholesterol is a very little high.

120
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,680
That's it!

121
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,820
You're an excellent doctor.  You're an excellent doctor.

122
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,800
Cholesterol, you're dead.

123
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,610
It's great!

124
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,890
Of course, green vegetable juice really is the best for your cholesterol!

125
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
Get a grip, Lee Kang Woo.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Get a hold of yourself. Get a hold of yourself!

127
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,710
Kang Woo.  Green vegetable juice will help you to win.

128
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,930
Joo Seo Yeon?

129
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,210
What do you want now?

130
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,540
It's about the budget for the track team. Didn't the chief director sign his approval?

131
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,500
- Nope. 
 - Really?

132
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,090
He said that he would.

133
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,490
She caused such a commotion yesterday.

134
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,940
Anyway, he didn't show up to work.

135
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,860
What? That's not right.  I definitely saw his car this morning.

136
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,260
She doesn't even trust what I'm saying.

137
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,350
No, there's no way, Lee Kang Woo.  No way.

138
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,060
No... no way.

139
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,830
There's no point in going to work all the way there to be stressed.

140
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:48,990
I'm the chief director! I can go whenever I want.

141
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,170
Why is he not here yet?

142
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,520
 While I'm waiting for you, my dear. 

143
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:23,120
 At the place we promised to meet. 

144
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,630
 Every footprint that comes near. 

145
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,990
 Stays and beats in my heart. 

146
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,240
 I'm coming to you... 

147
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,220
 while waiting. 

148
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,210
 Through the door strangers open. 

149
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,600
 And via all the traces in my heart. 

150
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,300
 I'm coming to you... 

151
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,180
 while waiting. 

152
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,070
It is a poem by Poet Hwang Ji Woo, titled "While I Am Waiting for You."

153
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,750
How is it?

154
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,130
There is no difference between the seaweed farm and here.

155
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,610
Wake up, you seaweeds!

156
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,500
You're not waking up?

157
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,320
Wake up!

158
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,670
My poor feet.

159
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,500
- Just wear slippers. 
 - They don't match my outfit.

160
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,900
- No one's going to notice. 
- I will!  I'll notice.

161
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,020
By the way, do you run a small business for producing some goods in your home?

162
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,870
Seo Joon and Joo Hee both kept nodding, looking like pickaxes being used, during the class.

163
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,810
Were they forced to make a soccer ball overnight? Were you forcing them into labor?

164
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,300
'It's okay to be the mischievous rascals but just grow up healthy.'  That's my home motto for them.

165
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
Oh my. Are you raising 5-year-old kids?

166
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,050
Keep it in mind that they might easily be placed the last on their grade.

167
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,860
Okay, I'll pay more attention to it.

168
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,020
Lee Kang Woo didn't show up, did he?

169
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,850
He'll come tomorrow.

170
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,900
Just look at the way you're shaking. Are you sure you two made up?

171
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,800
We did! He said, "Let's get along well. I'll sign it tomorrow."

172
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,270
Let's go. It's time for the vice principal to yell at us.

173
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,730
We are now three weeks away from the midterm exams.

174
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,400
By dawdling and procrastinating,

175
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,500
don't make up the questions for a test last minute.

176
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,400
As an educator, with all your heart and responsibility,

177
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,820
prepare for the midterm exams.

178
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,130
That's all for today.

179
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,550
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

180
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,920
The chief director will come tomorrow, right?

181
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,850
I really have to get his signature for the track team budget.

182
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,060
Isn't that up to the chief director?

183
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,260
Min Hyeok, why do you keep giving Seo Yeon food?

184
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,780
I'm trying to seduce her.

185
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,100
What?

186
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,300
What the heck? Seduce her?

187
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,340
It's not that he likes Seo Yeon but he tries to do some kind of test on her?

188
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,950
 Your call cannot be connected at this time so it will be forwarded to the voice mail. 

189
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,180
If Hyung Kang Woo doesn't come tomorrow...

190
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,380
♫  Why does my heart go like this?  It keeps going pit-a-pat  ♫

191
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,690
♫  From when have I been like this?  ♫

192
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,580
What should I give her to cheer her up?

193
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,160
♫  Whenever I look at you,  why does my heart keep trembling  ♫

194
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,720
♫  When I look at you, who won't stop for me  ♫

195
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,960
What were you so curious about that you had to call?

196
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,090
 I thought you were going to school for work. 

197
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,880
You're relieved, right? Because it's not the office?

198
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,990
You think you have a chance against me?

199
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,970
Well, If you get that nervous, then just get married already.

200
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,810
You said she would give you the position of president after you get married.

201
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,180
What's the problem? Just pick anyone.

202
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,420
That's why it doesn't work with you because of that.

203
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,600
Marriage is a business of which the cost-to-benefit ratio is zero.  On top of that, pick anyone?

204
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,610
You're really something. Noona, business is your whole life, right?

205
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,850
Since you mentioned business, let me ask a question.  Do these clothes look good?

206
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
 Why do you not respond? 

207
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,600
How did you find out?  Did you keep an eye on me?

208
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,640
If you say, "keeping an eye on you", it's too much but it's a sort of managing...

209
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,810
 Don't worry too much.  Our family doesn't know it.  

210
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,920
And tell me if you want to do business in the fashion field.  I'll look over it.

211
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,600
 You don't respond again. 

212
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,200
I'll take care of it on my own.  I don't intend to ask for help.

213
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,780
 You receive all of your living and entertainment expenses. 

214
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,830
But you're telling me not to mind your business at all?  Is it your pride or drunken courage?

215
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,940
It's something I really want to do. Please pretend you don't know.

216
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,330
-  I won't offer my help twice.  
 - Okay.

217
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,780
- With something completely unrelated to Shinhwa Food? 
 - Yeah.

218
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,110
Alright, then, good luck.

219
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,400
 If your design is launched, I'll wear your clothes.  Goodbye.

220
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,360
I guess he wasn't just playing.

221
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,120
No! No! No!

222
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,130
I'm so embarrassed. Why did I get caught already?  I should've gotten caught after I have accomplished something first!

223
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,660
Ugh, seriously!

224
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,860
What?

225
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,150
You know there's a meeting today, right?

226
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,110
See you later, Team Leader Lee.

227
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,680
I can't believe the mighty Lee Kang Woo is working under me!

228
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,500
Don't they know about separating trash and recycling?

229
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,580
If we're like this and get fined,

230
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,700
whose money does it get paid with?  Ah really, these punks.

231
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,450
They don't have love for the company.

232
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,300
 I have a great idea. 

233
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,690
What about?

234
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,120
A way that we can find out what Park Hyeon Soo does for his living.

235
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,650
As if you really have to...

236
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,570
You're not curious?  If Lee Kang Woo is for Shinhwa Food, then he must be something as well.

237
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,810
What even if so?  You already excluded him from your husband candidates?

238
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,720
You, you, you.  You know only about one but don't know about ten.

239
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,740
Starting at Lee kang Woo, going through Park Hyeon Soo,

240
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,630
and going to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th person.

241
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,050
If you keep going over and over,  you'll be able to pick at least one man.

242
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,140
Is it possible all of them would be a kind of person like Oppa Won Seok?

243
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,040
Wow, I think you're really great.

244
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,430
Marrying a rich man without this much sense and effort would be too greedy.

245
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,000
So?  What is your great idea?

246
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,300
 Park Hyeon Soo 

247
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,410
Here!  He is a customer of your bar.  Look at him carefully.

248
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,840
He used to look old so he doesn't look much different between this and now.  You know him, right?

249
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,070
What?  Did he do something bad to you?

250
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,400
That is... In fact...

251
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,490
You got the wrong person.  It doesn't work with women's tears for him.

252
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,120
We have to know what this rascal is doing for his living.

253
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,920
She is just...

254
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,590
He and his partner were hitting on Seo Yeon and me.

255
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,690
- Hitting on? 
 - Yeah.

256
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,170
They pretended not being gays and told us to date.  They thought we were easy.  Particularly, Seo Yeon were.

257
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,400
Look at this.  You know who he is, right?  What does he do for a living?

258
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,640
I don't remember all of customers.  Even if I know them,

259
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,670
I can't disclose their private life without permission.

260
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,250
Please, Oppa.

261
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,680
I told you it doesn't work.

262
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,540
Have a nice day.  See you later.

263
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,590
I'm not sure for the oldest brother but there is no way for the second brother to tell us about it.

264
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,360
What are you doing?

265
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,150
How do you feel when you wake up together with a person who looks like him?

266
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,900
Ah, it smells so good.

267
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,060
Are you a pervert?

268
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,200
- Ah.  One more minute! One minute! 
 - Get up!  Get up!

269
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,900
If I lie down here, will this bed be worn out?  Worn out? 
 - Get up! Get up!

270
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,030
You aren't scared of anything so you're lying on a man's bed.

271
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,620
- Oppa. 
 - Get up.

272
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,290
 You know him, right?  He and his partner were hitting on Seo Yeon and me. 

273
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,940
 You punk!  

274
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,550
 Who...? 

275
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,200
Shinhwa High School?  Why did I have to see Shinhwa High School even here?

276
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,540
Unnecessarily, it reminds of Joo Seo Yeon.

277
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,390
I see the stress reaction occurs only when I hang around Joo Seo Yeon.

278
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,340
Hey, did you decide which dance would you do at the monthly evaluation?

279
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,890
Why do I have to select it already?  There is plenty of time until then.

280
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,860
Hey, this time will be different from other times.

281
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,330
I heard the president would come too.

282
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,720
Well...

283
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,000
Wait.  I think I just saw the president.

284
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,060
What?  When?

285
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,480
At the elevator.  The top floor is for the president's office, right?

286
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,250
Wow, why didn't I think about it?

287
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,160
How does he look like?

288
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,300
As a rumor, he completely looks like a dirty piece of rug.

289
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,280
No, he looked crazily great...

290
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,170
I thought I was seeing a model.

291
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,390
- Is it true? 
 - Yeah!

292
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,200
Which floor did you see him at?

293
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,550
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

294
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,320
Sit down.

295
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,440
This monthly evaluation is pushed back after your midterm at the school.

296
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,200
- Pardon? 
 - Pardon?

297
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,140
If you don't get better grades than last time in school,

298
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,900
you'll not even be given a chance to participate in this monthly evaluation according to the president's special order.

299
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,040
- No. Teacher! 
 - Teacher, that's not fair.

300
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,810
Be quiet.  If you don't like it, you can leave.

301
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:15,260
Of course, you're kicking out your luck guaranteed to succeed as a junior team of High Seven Team.

302
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,000
Now, each of you tell me your goals for your grades at school.

303
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,810
Lee Yeong Eun.

304
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,590
Wow.   You were 20th in your school?

305
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,030
I think it'll be fine if you maintain your grades like this.

306
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,160
I'll be ranked within the top ten on grades.

307
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,350
If you don't make the grades you promised, it'll be over so think carefully.

308
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,410
I'm confident.

309
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,400
All right, If you insist so.

310
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,010
Next, Joo Seo Joon.

311
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,590
You must be happy because you have a lot of room to improve.

312
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,310
Tell me how many ranks will you improve?

313
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,500
100 ranks!

314
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,930
We can tell the artists are the walking advertisement billboard.

315
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,640
What they wear, eat, and sleep itself

316
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,240
produces an enormous income.

317
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,540
Particularly, fashion draws a lot of loyalties.

318
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,620
What I'm saying is, if a t-shirt costs several dozens of million won and my celebrity wears it,

319
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,260
they're going to wear the exact same t-shirts even if they need to work part-time.

320
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,050
For example, our company's goods profit is immense.

321
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,040
With this unfashionable design.

322
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,900
What I'm saying is, let's take advantage of it.

323
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,570
By  launching our own brand, going beyond just goods that we have now,

324
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,880
let's expand our market target to the general public besides our fans.

325
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
Then now, we have the advertisement models.

326
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,480
And we have funds and our customers as well.

327
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,020
What don't we have?

328
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,610
Designer.

329
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,270
The clothes are nice, right?

330
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,210
This friend made those clothes.

331
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,310
This is Designer Lee Kang Woo who will launch the fashion brand at HS Center.

332
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,010
Was that all?  You don't have anything to say?

333
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,150
I'll talk to you later whenever I need to.

334
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,380
As you see, this fellow is a rude jerk but he is very talented.  So let's let it slide.

335
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,630
Ah, I can surely bring a famous renowned designer.

336
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,530
But if I do, I'll have to pay a lot of money.

337
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,660
Luckily, he is not very famous yet so he is still cheap.

338
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,510
Besides launching a new brand,

339
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,780
he'll be a style director who'll be in charge of styling of High Seven Team who'll come back and the new teams who'll debut.

340
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,930
Hey, you're not really interested in doing women's clothes?

341
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,870
I told you I don't want to.  It was written on the contract, but why do you keep mentioning it?

342
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,980
I got caught by Noona.

343
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,250
What?  That you're going to design here?

344
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,950
What did she say?  Didn't she say to quit right away?

345
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,250
No, the other way.  If I were interested in doing business in fashion, she said to submit a business proposal.

346
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,800
- Then she would examine it closely. 
 - Is that so?

347
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
- Try to get some recommendations from Shinhwa Food. 
 - Hey!

348
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,260
I got it.  I got it.

349
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,450
Alright.  I'll do it with only two things–my money and your brain.

350
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,670
- It's ready, President. 
 - Okay.  Let's go.

351
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,660
What now?

352
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,820
Wow, it's good.

353
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,250
Hey!

354
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,500
Hey!  Turn the frown upside down.

355
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,530
You're not a grandson of Shinhwa Food or something here.  You're just a mere employee.

356
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,620
None of the lone people succeeded by himself in the business.

357
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,950
All of those people are the ones that will support you.

358
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,910
Hey, hey, hey.  If you don't like this and that,

359
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,340
you may start your own business comfortably by getting money from your family.

360
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,870
May I break our contract? I won't charge the penalty for breach of contract. I'll call  Kang In woo.

361
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,290
Hey, hey.  Who said I wouldn't go?  I'm going.

362
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,500
 Meeting the most notable female in 2019, Lee Kang Hee, Director of Sinhwa Food 

363
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,080
Does she often come here?

364
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,870
It won't work, Hyung.  She doesn't come here to meet men.  She really only dances then leaves.

365
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,250
Face?  It won't work.  Money?  Never work.

366
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,880
She has nothing lacking.   Why should she?

367
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,810
Really?

368
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,150
Even if it were you, it wouldn't work.

369
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,390
 Meeting the most notable female in 2019, Lee Kang Hee, Director of Sinhwa Food 

370
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,000
It's funny.
