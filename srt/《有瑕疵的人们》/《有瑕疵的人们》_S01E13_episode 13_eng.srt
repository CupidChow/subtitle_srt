1
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,810
♫  Happy birthday to you,  happy birthday to you  ♫

2
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  My dear Min Hyeok, happy birthday to you  ♫

3
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,580
 Blow the candles out.  Blow. Not you.

4
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,860
 You got a letter from your father.

5
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,320
 Happy birthday to you, Min Hyeok.  I made a well in honor of your name in Tanzania.

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,330
 H-Honey.

7
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,800
 Min Hyeok.  Ta-da.  I, your uncle, prepared a birthday present for you.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,580
 -  Here, here, Min Hyeok. 
 - Wow, Min Hyeok must be happy.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,770
 Dad, please give me a present as big as this on my birthday.

10
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,460
 Of course.  I'll prepare a present as big as this for my Kang Woo.

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,180
-  This big. 
 - Here, give me a high five.

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,110
 My parents who had a bigger dream than just having kids,

13
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,300
 have stayed in other countries for 300 days out of 365  per year

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,640
 since I started walking,

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,750
 while digging wells, building schools, and setting up hospitals.

16
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,470
 It's usually said that parents have an unrequited love for their kids.

17
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,320
 But I have unrequited love for my parents.

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,970
 I studied hard only for the reason of impressing my parents.

19
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,220
 Cheers!

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,230
 My Kang Woo grew up a lot, didn't he?

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,680
 Yeol, he is as tall as you.

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,950
 Don't feel so sad.

23
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,450
 Is it once or twice that your parents aren't here even though they said they would be here?

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,170
 If you dwell on everything negative,  you're the only one that will have a hard time.

25
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,220
 Okay, I'm fine.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,540
 Have some too.

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,030
 - I don't want to.  
- It's really good.

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,860
 Oh my. Brothers don't look alike at all.

29
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,790
 People say that no younger brothers are as good as the older one. They are the opposite in this family.

30
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,160
 The younger one is so smart,

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,790
 so the chairman has very high expectations for him.

32
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,330
 - Is that so? 
 - Yeah.

33
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,600
 I heard everything they said but I didn't want to comfort him because he has many things.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,710
 I thought I could have, at least, the strangers' compliments,

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,940
 because he has many things. So at least I could have one.

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,300
Hey, have some.

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,690
Cheers!

38
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,860
Here, here, please two more dishes.

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,820
  At least once, I also...

40
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,690
 Want to have one.

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,840

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,690
What are you? Who exactly are you?

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,600
By any chance, Joo Seo Yeon...

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,540
Ask it.  You know I can't lie.

45
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,320
Ask me why I'm being like this.

46
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,500
Do you like Joo—

47
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,580
Why do you stop in the middle of asking?

48
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,470
- Why should I ask? 
 - Because you're curious about it.

49
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,670
No, I'm not curious at all.

50
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,310
I'll answer if you ask me.

51
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,820
- I won't listen. 
 - I'm telling you I'll answer.

52
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,980
I told you I don't want to hear.

53
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,240
- I told you I would answer. 
 - I won't listen!

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,340
I'm just going to tell you, then.  I like Teacher—

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,290
Listen!  Just listen!

56
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,500
- Listen! Listen! I like Tea— 
 - Lalalalala!

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,370
- Listen!  Listen!  I like Teacher— 
- Lalalalalalalala!

58
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,990
- ♫ Hare rabbit, hare rabbit, where are you going♫ 
 - Listen! Listen!

59
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,290
- ♫ By hopping, hopping, where are you going ♫
 - I won't!  I won't!

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Are you sure?

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,370
I told you I wouldn't!

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,570
What is this!  Where is Joo Seo Yeon?

63
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,100
 Episode 13

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,790
How did you know where Teacher Joo lives?

65
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,480
She was my classmate in middle school.

66
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,940
If you were a classmate, you would know where she lives?

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,940
We were close.

68
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,830
Then why do you act like this now?

69
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,710
I told you that is not your business.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,120
Thank you.

71
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,010
I'll mind her business from now on.

72
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,870
- I like Teacher Joo— 
 - Taxi!

73
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,040
- Ah, my head.  My head hurts. 
 - Here, drink this.

74
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,990
It's a relief that you didn't kill him.

75
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,270
Good job!  You managed to hold back very well.  I'm proud of you, Joo Seo Yeon.

76
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,060
But... I think I might have hit him.

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,290
How?

78
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,150
I think... I might have thrown some stones at him.

79
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,080
What did you say?

80
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,300
Why did he take a taxi in spite of having a car?

81
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,100
What?  What happened?

82
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,460
Hey!  Did you steal Lee Kang Woo's car?

83
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,570
Oh, no, no!

84
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,860
T-That...  Yesterday...

85
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,340
Is this poison?

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,730
You drink this first.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,190
This was given by someone who was not supposed to give this.  We're just wondering if this was mixed with poison.

88
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,020
It looks like there's nothing abnormal.  There is no mark that it has been tampered with.

89
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,100
What is this then?  How much is he going to bother me today so he gave me medicine first?

90
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,980
Chief Director Lee gave this to you?

91
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,470
Yes.  Did I make any mistakes yesterday by chance?

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,670
No, you went home safely by a taxi alone.

93
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,750
Then why?

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,090
I don't care.  I'm going to drink first.

95
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,460
Somehow, Lee Kan Woo's behavior looks like a child's–one who is bothering a girl whom he likes.

96
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,180
Then why did he tell a useless and stupid lie with Park Hyeon Soo?

97
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,620
  What do you mean a lover or a sponsor?  That... with Kang Woo...

98
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,320
 And I... Why... How?

99
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:16,070
 Even Park Hyeon Soo begged me so earnestly never to tell Lee Kang Woo that we know about their relationship.

100
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,800
No way!

101
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,360
Finally, The Most Agile King shows up.

102
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,090
Hello?

103
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,440
Let me ask one question.

104
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,170
I understand you lied to us because of how you considered us.

105
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,930
How do you say we considered you as such?

106
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,700
No further for that.  Did Lee Kang Woo really know about it?

107
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,080
Didn't you do everything by yourself?

108
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,530
 I won't see you again if Joo Seo Yeon finds out this.  Understand?

109
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,990
No.  Of course, Kang Woo knew it.

110
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,680
You're saying Lee Kang Woo really faked asking Seo Yeon out with him or something after he and you planned it together?

111
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,620
Really without any other feelings, but only to take revenge on her for what happened in the past?

112
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,330
Yeah.

113
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,940
So you mean Lee Kang Woo really doesn't like Joo Seo Yeon, don't you?

114
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,440
What? Kang Woo likes Joo Seo Yeon?  No way.

115
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,800
Well, if there were no guys in her way, that would be great.  I'm going to select her partner for her.

116
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,860
That stupid jerk is blind with his open eyes, even though she is right in front of him.

117
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,910
- What do you mean...? 
 - No further discussion.  Let's not see each other any more.

118
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,670
Don't cling to Lee Kang Woo too much but just do your cleaning job well.

119
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,920
They say, "Every occupation deserves respect."  But isn't it only common sense that you should dress and drink within your budget?

120
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,140
I'll pay for the drink.

121
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,860
How was she so calm?  She should've gotten mad.  It bothers me now.

122
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,900
By the way,  why did she mention cleaning?

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
Ah, Teacher Joo!

124
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,480
If you're on the way to the teachers' room, can you take a pot on my desk outside?

125
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,870
- It's time for my babies to get some needed sunshine,  so do cautiously. 
 - Pardon?

126
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,620
And on your way,  throw away some used papers from the teachers' room as well.

127
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,520
A P.E. teacher has a lot of free time, as Chief Director said.

128
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,870
Ah, P.E. Teacher is not busy?

129
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,350
Yes, they have a lot of time.

130
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,180
Ah, that's good.  She must take good care of it, cautiously.

131
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,200
Do a good job.

132
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,300
Hey!

133
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,020
Chief Director!

134
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,810
These papers are still usable.

135
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,040
You have to save this kind of stuff so we can reduce our school budget.

136
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,670
And Teacher Joo, you stand by all the time from starting work to the end of work.

137
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm not sure when I'm going to order you to do some work.

138
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,290
- Absolutely without doing any other work! 
 - Yes.

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,970
Wait only for my order.  Understand?

140
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,910
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes.

141
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,550
- Why does he take my pot? 
 - No, no,

142
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,880
- Just hold back. 
 - Ah, really.

143
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,830
Who did they think they were so they dared to order her to do this or that? She is sick because she is so hungover right now.

144
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,230
Is it today?  I'm not sure whether I can go or not.

145
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,800
If possible, please be here.  A lot of guys are talking about you too much.

146
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,270
Like you died in a foreign country or are addicted to drugs... They're starting only nonsense rumors.

147
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,470
Why are they overly concerned about someone else's matters?

148
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,560
 Are you just someone else?   You're a grandson of Shinhwa Food.

149
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,830
 Don't disgrace the company with your rumors.  I understood you would be there.

150
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,370
This will be bothersome.

151
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,340

You know you have to bring a partner, right?

152
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,050
 Don't make someone else's ladies entice you by coming alone.

153
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,130
 How about you, Teacher Joo?  What kind of type do you like?

154
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,910
 I look at men's faces a lot.

155
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,400
It's not like I look ugly.

156
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,110
What are you doing?  You have to get uglier, two-hundred times uglier than now!

157
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,080
- Why do you look so handsome?
 - Pardon?

158
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,670
Mole!

159
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,760
- Why are you acting like this? 
 - Health Teacher, is your house a monthly rent, lease, or owned?

160
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,340
- I own it. 
 - So you're a little rich.

161
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,890
What are your parents doing for living?

162
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,140
They do volunteer work.

163
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,930
They have good characters.  Which university did you graduate?

164
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,000
Hanguk University.

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,170
No way!  Hanguk University Medical School?

166
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,980
Yes.  By the way, why are you asking those questions?

167
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,610
Why are you working here instead of the hospital?

168
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,050
According to the School Health Act, each school shall employ

169
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,450
a health teacher as a medical service person or pharmacist—

170
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,360
That's enough.  I'm leaving now.

171
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,390
Joo Seo Yeon, I'll definitely make you—

172
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,300
So you're saying you'll get in an awkward situation if you go alone again?

173
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,570
Yes.  I just didn't want to go but they have big mouths.

174
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,550
This request is too much, isn't it?

175
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,280
- If you don't want to— 
 - Let's go. 
 - Pardon?

176
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,490
You've helped me so much so far.

177
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,320
If you're okay with me, I'm willing to.

178
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,530
It's more than just okay.  See you after work then.

179
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,750
♫  Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods on an old Mustang, where we sang  ♫

180
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,880
♫  Songs with all our childhood friends  ♫

181
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,130
Why are we here?

182
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,670
I'm short on the consideration.  I'll call Mi Kyeong quickly and ask to bring the proper clothes.

183
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,570
- Teacher Kim Mi Kyeong already picked out your clothes. 
- Pardon?

184
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,880
You're here?

185
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,860
♫  Singing at the top of both our lungs  ♫

186
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,160
♫  Now we're under the covers  ♫

187
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,670
What happened?

188
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,600
Health Teacher asked me to select clothes for you. How is it?  It's very nice, isn't it?

189
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
 Sale Price: 4.3 million won (~ $3,700)

190
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,530
Do you know how much it costs?

191
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,280
Hey!  Don't count your chickens first.  Who said he would give it to you?

192
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,210
 You just wear it today and give it back to Health Teacher.

193
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,420
Look at you.  You have a complete thief's mind.

194
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,130
Since you decided to help him, help him properly.

195
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,470
 When you finish, call me, you girl.   You must be happy.

196
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,620
Hey, Kim Mi Kyeong.

197
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,260
Don't make fun of me.

198
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,130
No way I would do that.

199
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,760
Ah, really.  This is not my style.

200
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,830
I'm coming out.

201
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,110
What?  Do I look weird?

202
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,160
That's why I told you it wouldn't go with me.

203
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,740
Because I'm just scared.

204
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,230
I'm just scared because you are so pretty.

205
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,000
Min Hyeok!

206
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,800
Please go over there first.

207
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Hi Min Hyeok.  I'm seeing you here.

208
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,660
By the way... Who?

209
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,990
She is a teacher at my school.  She is my aunt.

210
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,600
Hello.

211
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,590
- Ah, yes.  Your name? 
 - My name is—

212
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,520
Excuse me, Aunt.  I'm late a little bit.  Let's go.

213
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,110
Okay, see you later.  Oh my.

214
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,940
Min Hyeok has a girlfriend?

215
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,610
What are you talking about, abruptly?

216
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,920
 I just met Min Hyeok.  he was with a lady.

217
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,070
 Their vibe looked unusual.

218
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,370
You must be mistaken.

219
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,580
He said she was a teacher at the same school.    You really don't know about them?

220
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,690
Don't worry.  I won't ask you to give me the clothes.

221
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,730
You're afraid that I would ask you to give me this, right?  But don't worry.

222
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,530
Do you think I'm a person who would receive such expensive clothes?  You worry too much.

223
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,760
By the way, do I have to wear such expensive clothes here?

224
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,900
Yes.  The more expensive, the better.  The much more expensive.

225
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,460
I didn't think you as such a person, Health Teacher.

226
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,250
By the way, do you keep calling me like that?

227
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,820
You are here as my partner.  Calling me Health Teacher is a little bit...

228
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,520
Then... Min Hyeok?

229
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,020
Min Hyeok.  Min Hyeok.  Min Hyeok.

230
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,200
Let's go together, Min Hyeok.

231
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,700
Hi Min Hyeok!

232
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,590
Oh, Lee Min Hyeok!  You finally show up yourself.

233
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,130
Wow, who is she, next to you?

234
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,470
Hello.  How do you do?

235
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,960
Ah, yes. Hey, Lee Min Hyeok.  You hid such a beautiful lady completely.

236
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,800
Is this the first time that Min Hyeok brought woman?

237
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,700
Thinking about it, yes, it is.

238
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,510
What are you doing for living?

239
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,580
Pardon?  Oh, I'm teaching kids.

240
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,090
She is working at the same school where I work.

241
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,500
School?  Are you doing lectures at the college?

242
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,920
No, I'm a health teacher at the high school.

243
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,930
Health teacher?

244
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,140
- How is the food? 
 - It's very good.

245
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,740
I didn't taste it all yet.

246
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,230
How about this one?

247
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,590
Have more.

248
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,300
Thank you.

249
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,340
Who knew the great Min Hyeok would act like that?

250
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,500
Hey!  You must be jealous of her.

251
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,090
Excuse me, you two.  Who liked first?

252
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,660
Of course, Seo Yeon liked him first?

253
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,410
- Drink water, please.
 - Ah, yes.  Thank you.

254
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,100
I did first.

255
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,690
- You? 
 - Right. I fell for her at first sight. So what?

256
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,630
Aigoo.  Of course, she has some charms.

257
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,660
She is not so charming that someone could fall for her at first sight, right?

258
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,690
Didn't he say I was a beautiful lady? Seriously.

259
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,780
I fell for her at first sight.

260
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,340
Then I gradually began to like her.

261
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,410
If I stayed next to her, I feel even I would become a good person.

262
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,000
And I really want to become a good person.

263
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,770
Wow, Lee Min Hyeok.  You've really changed a lot.

264
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,990
Are we here to hear about their dating story right now?

265
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,580
Well, well, well!  You all prepared?

266
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
- Has it already been a year?
 - A year flies fast.

267
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,140
We'll donate one of the things that we're wearing.

268
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,680
Proceeds will be delivered to a children's hospital.

269
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,160
You could just donate in cash but why are you doing it this way?

270
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,780
They need a pretext.

271
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,240
A pretext that spruces up this useless meeting.

272
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,410
That fellow always wears only top brands from head to toe.

273
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,110
He wears a 50 thousand won worth necktie only for this meeting.

274
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,300
This fellow gives a handkerchief and that fellow gives socks.

275
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,280
Well, you can't force them for donations.

276
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,490
I'm going to force them for donations today.

277
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,580
For us,

278
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,780
we're going to donate everything we wear right now.  Right, Seo Yeon?

279
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,160
 The more expensive, the better.  The much, much, more expensive, the better.

280
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,910
Yes.  From head,

281
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,590
to toes.

282
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,040
Without anything left out.

283
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,260
Then we need to do the same.

284
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,240
Hey, that bag looks nice.

285
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,890
- Me too.
 - Me too.

286
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,760
By the way, how did you know where my house is?

287
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
- On the day of school dinner gathering—
 - I see.

288
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,820
I told you when I got drunk.  Ah, really, I'm a punk.

289
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,080
Today was the first day that we collected such good stuff.  Thank you.

290
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,010
Thank you for letting me participate in such a nice event even though I didn't know what was going on.

291
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,480
Ah, right.  Do you know I was completely fluttered earlier?

292
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,790
Because you told the story of how you liked me so realistically, I almost got fooled.

293
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:18,710
It's real.  I can't lie.

294
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,810
Yes, of course.  I'll get going.

295
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,970
It's true.

296
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,260
Yes, yes, yes.

297
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,880
Really, it's true.

298
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,820
Of course, you do. Goodbye.

299
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,730
It's true.

300
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,600
You never smiled like that when you were with me.

301
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,820
You never joked around like that when you were with me.

302
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,120
You never—

303
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,350
Matched well like that with me.

304
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Taking out his watch like this,

305
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,700
what did you say?

306
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,890
"We're going to donate everything we wear right now."

307
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,870
See?  So cool, isn't it?

308
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,820
What brings you here to have a cafeteria food, Chief Director?

309
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,370
It's up to me.

310
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,500
Since an heir of Shinhwa Food eats food with us, I'm so honored that I don't know what to do.

311
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,890
I know, right?  Teacher Lee Min Hyeok, an heir of Shinhwa Food does it, right?

312
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,090
Teacher Lee Min Hyeok, may I have a question?

313
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,380
When we had a dinner gathering, you told me to ask a question, right?

314
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,080
I want to ask that question now.

315
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,100
Why do you mind Teacher Joo and my bus—

316
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,990
What are you doing?

317
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,380
You started first.

318
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,220
Lee Min Hyeok. Why do you mind Teacher Joo and my bus—

319
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,650
Hey!

320
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,100
This is a school.

321
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,170
What are the two of you doing?

322
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,870
Hey!

323
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,480
Teacher Joo, I have some orders to give you so come to the chief director's office right away.  Right away!

324
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,090
I'm just a punching bag, right?

325
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,270
You two are very close, Lee Kang Woo and Health Teacher.

326
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,340
They're kids, both of them are kids.

327
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,680
Ah, what?!

328
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,580
Sorry!  I'll be back later.

329
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,700
Report the track team's daily activities.

330
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,580
Every day, without missing a day.

331
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,500
What?

332
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,970
You can't do it?

333
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,100
You said it was very important so you intruded into my house in the middle of the night to get the paper signed.

334
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,900
You said you were confident.

335
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,050
Still, how can I report it every day—

336
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,450
Since even Chief Director supports it, I have to see the results with my own eyes

337
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,540
so I can decide whether I keep the track team or not.

338
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,370
And whether I keep Teacher Joo at this school.

339
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,590
Lee Kang—  I mean, Chief Director.

340
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,580
Then I assume that you understood it.  Starting today, you do it.

341
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,980
What did you do yesterday?

342
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,500
I'm asking what you did yesterday after work.

343
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,670
I washed my feet then slept! Why?!

344
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,900

345
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,990
I shouldn't have asked.  I asked her uselessly.

346
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,250
Lee Kang Woo, that bastard, really!

347
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:23,400
Right.  I should hold back.  Since I'm a good girl, I should.  There is nothing I can't do, right?

348
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,370
I'm Joo Seo Yeon.  I'm coming in.

349
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,700
What's wrong with him?

350
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,940
Where are you?  I'm here to report.

351
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,430
 Ah, I forgot.

352
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,710
"Ah, I forgot."

353
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,580
- Then I'll report it tomorrow. 
-  Come to my house.

354
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Ah, well—  Hello?

355
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,200
You, bastard!
