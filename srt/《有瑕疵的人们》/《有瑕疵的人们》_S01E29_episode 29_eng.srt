00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,480
 Episode 29

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,360
I won't go home.

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,730
I'll stay with you.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,350
What?

5
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:41,710

6
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,070
Let's stay together, Kang Woo.

7
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,770
Joo Seo Yeon...

8
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,680
I don't know either.

9
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,030
- So... 
 - Why? What?

10
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,350
What? Why?

11
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,060
- You said something first! 
 - Right! I did!

12
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,310
So... Could we...

13
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,500
I have to go to the bathroom!

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,460
Oh! Okay! Take your–

15
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,890
Take your time!

16
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,070
♬  I found a love for me  ♬

17
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,190
♬  Darling just dive right in  ♬

18
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,840
♬  And follow my lead  ♬

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,510
♬  Well I found a girl  ♬

20
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,640
What?
♬  Beautiful and sweet  ♬

21
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
♬  I never knew you were the someone—  ♬

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,820
Is it childish? 
♬  I never knew you were the someone—  ♬

23
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,350
I don't know... much.

24
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,650
What?

25
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,800
I... don't know much.

26
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,180
I don't... know much.

27
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,040
I know a lot! Don't worry!

28
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,790
I know a lot!

29
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,790
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

30
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,200
I know a lot! So... Just stay still.

31
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,320
Big Hyung, what are you doing?

32
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,280
Where did Noona go?

33
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,050
Wait, what's going on?

34
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh, is this Mi Kyeong?

35
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,410
I'm sorry to call so late but Lee Kang Woo, do you know his address?

36
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,300
Daebak!

37
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,910
- Let's go! 
 - Where?

38
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,690
The site of Joo Seo Yeon and Lee Kang Woo's being arrested.

39
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,070
- That— 
 - It sounds so fun!

40
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,220
Okay, okay!

41
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,270
- Okay, okay. 
 - Wait up!

42
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,040
Slow down!

43
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,020
Oh, I don't know much,

44
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,200
but how long are we going to...

45
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,470
- Should we stop this and go? 
 - Huh?

46
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,280
To a room?

47
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,280
- I'm going, okay? 
 - Okay!

48
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,450
♬  I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone  ♬

49
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,760
First! Let our bodies
 ♬  I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone  ♬

50
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,490
First! Let our bodies
 ♬  I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn  ♬

51
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,150
loosen up like this!
 ♬  I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn  ♬

52
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,560
Of course!  Whatever you do, warming up is important!

53
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
Shake, shake! Shake all!

54
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
Yeah!

55
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,510
My body is getting warmed up.

56
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,590
It looks like the heat goes up this much.

57
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,400
What are they doing?

58
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,570
Even though you look awful, their conversation is a killer.

59
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,240
♬  I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs  ♬

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,860
♬  I crashed my car into the bridge  ♬

61
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,510
♬  I don't care, I love it  ♬

62
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,530
♬  I don't care  ♬

63
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,540
♬  You're on a different road, I'm in the milky way  ♬

64
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,450
♬  You want me down on earth, but I am up in space  ♬

65
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,050
♬  You're so damn hard to please, we gotta—  ♬

66
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
What an expensive wine.

67
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,990
If you want to do it carelessly, don't even start it.

68
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,790
It's nothing like that.

69
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,350
I heard you know about our parents' accident.

70
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,060
Yes.

71
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,120
Then is everything figured out?

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,150
Yes.

73
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,850
Nonetheless,

74
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,110
I need Joo Seo Yeon.

75
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm sorry

76
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,140
that I'm a shameless and selfish guy.

77
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,050
You're right.

78
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,460
I think he is not a bad guy.

79
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,890
Big Oppa, are you really going to be like this?

80
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,250
You— How can you be so outspoken right now!

81
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,830
Why wouldn't I be?

82
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,180
I'm spending the night with someone I love! So what?

83
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,230
What? You! Is there anything you can't say in front of me?

84
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,160
- Before dirt goes into my eyes (when dead and buried), you can never! 
 - Okay, if you want.

85
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,850
Hey! What does he do? How can he afford to live in a place like that when he's so young?

86
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,100
None of your business!

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,800
You don't know how hard it was for me to go there! Ugh!

88
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,060
Really, there is no privacy in this house!

89
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,330
You-you-you still think you did nothing wrong.

90
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,410
It's only ending this easily because it's me!

91
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,520
 If Won Seok and Seo Joon knew about this...

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,730
  If you keep acting like this, I'm going to tell Won Seok everything!

93
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,500
What a relief. It was so awkward I wanted to die.

94
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,680
What went wrong?

95
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,960
 What do you mean what's the problem? It's everything.

96
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,930
What?

97
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,710
I'm saying that from your head to your toes, everything is a problem.

98
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,580
I don't want to even imagine your underwear.

99
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,030
Underwear?

100
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,000
What did you wear yesterday?

101
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,580
Just what I wear normally.

102
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,460
Let me see.

103
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,320
What a mess!

104
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,240
Lee Kang Woo was probably not so great himself since everything was so sudden!

105
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,610
Hey. Do you really still not understand?

106
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,980
Lee Kang Woo wears different socks for every different situation and place.

107
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,000
Moreover—  Forget about it.

108
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,350
- I think it's fine. 
 - What do you mean it's fine?

109
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,910
Did you stay up all night?

110
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,430
Well, it must be hard to sleep with all that energy.

111
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,060
Wake up.

112
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,120
Pay attention!

113
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm sorry. Charging into your house like that yesterday was not my intention at all.

114
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,430
What? No. Good job!

115
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,410
Joo Seo Yeon was probably scared. I don't want her to be scared.

116
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,520
Good job! Good job.

117
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,290
Someone might think I'm removing a corpse.  His face is so pale.

118
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,630
 I'm saying that from your head to your toes, everything is a problem.

119
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,020
 What a mess.

120
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,190
Wow, what a relief that I didn't show him this.

121
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,270
- Teacher! 
 - Yes?

122
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,480
Yes?

123
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,550
How are you feeling?

124
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,700
Yesterday, you looked unwell.

125
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,940
I'm fine. But what are you doing with that?

126
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,050
Oh, my student was using one that was a little worn out.

127
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,450
I was going to leave you a note, where did it go?

128
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,610
That I was going to take a box and that I'd bring another one tomorrow.

129
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,450
No need to bring it. I can give you that much.

130
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,760
Hey, well this is the school's property.

131
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,660
I'm a director! If you keep acting like this, I'll give you an entire box full!

132
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,140
I'll be fine with this.

133
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,110
Thank you.

134
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,650
This was stuck on you.

135
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,990
Oh, I see.

136
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:03,000
Even if I got closer to her, that wouldn't be enough.  But how did I step back?  I'm so pathetic.

137
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,370
Honey, what are you thinking about so deeply?

138
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,050
Joo Seo Yeon...

139
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,000
J-Joo—  What about Joo Seo Yeon?

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,050
I went to the school last time—

141
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,980
Sch-school?

142
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,760
What did you see at school? By chance,

143
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,790
M-M-Min Hyeok?

144
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Hey, you.

145
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,730
You went to the school. And?

146
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:57,010
Oh well, I didn't think she was rude or anything like that.

147
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,900
It seemed like the students listened to her.

148
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,240
You used to hate her before but what's changed?

149
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,180
I just wonder if it's the right thing to do that we should let him marry when he has someone,

150
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,190
instead of just watching him letting his time pass like we did to Kang Hee.

151
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,950
Kang Hee! If she had brought someone good, would I even think thoughts like this?

152
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,480
But why are you all of a sudden so upset with Kang Hee?

153
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,050
Really!

154
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,140
What kind of unbelievable situation...

155
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,770
Oh! Headache!

156
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,490
Lee Kang Hee!

157
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,790
You're not busy. I could have met you after work.

158
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,320
I wanted to see your face in the light.

159
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,720
You're pretty cool, my man.

160
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,830
Man?

161
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,490
What are your dongsengs (younger siblings) like?

162
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,310
My dongsengs?

163
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,040
This one is my big puppy, my small puppy, and my poop puppy.

164
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,000
This looks so cute. Why did you take this while your sister was sleeping?

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,830
Oh, this kid doesn't like to take pictures with us.

166
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,770
She probably thinks that she's the only one that doesn't look like us.

167
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,230
This wasn't our parents' first marriage.

168
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,730
This kid is so thoughtful that she's never said anything like this before.

169
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,930
Does it worry you?

170
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,800
I just worry without reason!

171
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,650
If someone says we don't look alike, I get all mad.

172
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,720
You really care about her, don't you?

173
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,220
This will make things more complicated.

174
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,750
Oh my ! You scared me!

175
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,120
Noona. What are you doing here?

176
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,000
Break up with her.

177
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,860
What?

178
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,580
I told you, right? Even if I can, you can't.

179
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,600
What are you talking about?

180
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,410
Break up with her.

181
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,710
By chance, did our parents say something?

182
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,790
You said you would be on my side.

183
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
I did.  I said I would do it but

184
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
I'll compensate you for your emotional and material damage no matter what.

185
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,200
- So break up with her— 
 - What will you compensate?

186
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,710
Anything. Just say the word.

187
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,310
Can you revive a dead person?

188
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,060
- What? 
 - For me, without her, I would die.

189
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,720
Hey, isn't that a little much?

190
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,100
That's how I feel. Joo Seo Yeon. Me. The end.

191
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,070
Were you always so simple?

192
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,790
I like her. What's complicated about that?

193
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,990
I don't even want to think of losing her.

194
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,590
One, two, three, four.

195
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,170
Two, two, three, four.  Okay, here we go!

196
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,730
It was good. It was good but that's not right. Watch me, okay?

197
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,310
Like this! This is dancing!

198
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,300
What was that noise?

199
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,020
Are you okay? Are you okay?

200
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,560
Ah, ah, my shoulder!

201
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,640
Don't touch me!

202
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,920
My shoulder!

203
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,430
Shut up, you bastard.

204
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,010
It hurts! It hurts so bad!

205
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,190
Hey, stop! You don't die from a shoulder dislocation!

206
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,350
Is this a problem of dying or not when I have tremendous pain?

207
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,210
It hurts so badly!

208
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,390
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,870
It probably hurts.

210
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,640
Yes, it hurts so badly!

211
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,870
Doctor, do you think I can dance anymore?

212
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,120
You'll be fine.

213
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,070
You're sure, right? You're not lying just to make me feel better, right?

214
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,440
Promise. Promise! Hurry up and promise me!

215
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,560
You rascal!  Such bad manners!

216
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,920
Don't worry. I can't lie.

217
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,230
Ah, ah, I'm in such a pain.

218
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,160
Noona, it hurts! My shoulder!

219
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,760
Go on. I'll wait here.

220
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,110
Come with me!

221
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,210
You''re just getting an x-ray! Why would I go with you?

222
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm scared! Wait outside the door.

223
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,510
Ah, really.  You're so big!

224
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,880
Thank you, Chief Director Lee. I'm sure you're busy, you should go!

225
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm not busy.

226
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,880
I'll wait until he's done.

227
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,840
No, then I'll feel too sorry.

228
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,470
Hey, he's a Sinhwa student.

229
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,480
And he got hurt at school.

230
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,590
Ohhh, responsibility for his students?

231
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,300
Teacher! Please wait here.

232
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,360
Hey! Did all your manners die?

233
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,070
Hey, Noona, you're going to say taxi fees are too expensive so we'll have to take the bus!

234
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,320
Please wait, Teacher!

235
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,540
Ow!

236
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,700
Hospitals all smell the same.

237
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm sorry.

238
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,750
 Doctor!

239
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,570
 Please, please I beg you.

240
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,710
 Everything I said before was all I can do.

241
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,250
 There's nothing else I can say.

242
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:00,410
 I can't... just send my Saet Byeol wrongly.

243
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,130
 Miss.

244
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,760
 Please, please. Just one more word. You saw everything!

245
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,880
 Please, please. Just one more word.

246
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,520
 Please, just please say one more thing.

247
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,560
 That the professor made a mistake!

248
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,750
 Doctor, please just say one thing.

249
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,490
 Please.

250
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,260
 Doctor, you shouldn't do that as thinking of my Saet Byeol.

251
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,690
 Please just say one word.

252
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,160
 It's already over.

253
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,970
 With pointless righteousness, don't make things complicated.

254
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:51,010
 It's not righteousness, it's the truth.

255
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,740
 You made a mistake.

256
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,820
 And? And what about you?

257
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,250
 You lied and covered up my mistake.

258
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,150
 And you think what you did is also a mistake.

259
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,900
 For you, it would be okay because you're a grandson of Sinhwa Food.

260
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,170
 But what about your seniors or juniors?  You don't think about them?

261
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,160
 If you do this, then what happens to their lies?

262
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,130
 That's right, just once

263
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,710
 Just once, let this go.

264
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,070
You looked like you could use something sweet.

265
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,260
Why do you keep eating something sweet?

266
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,540
I suffer from a lack of affection.

267
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,330
It's not what you really want to say, right?

268
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,720
No.

269
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,060
I guess you really can't lie.

270
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,120
If I ask you why, would you dislike that?

271
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,750
Yes.

272
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,290
You look like you really want to ask.

273
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,280
Was it obvious?

274
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,730
I suppose people have a limit to their lies.

275
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,240
If you tell a really big lie,

276
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,510
I found that you can't tell a lie anymore.

277
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,060
Are you okay?

278
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,550
You looked like you're having a hard time.

279
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,350
Why do you keep worrying about me?

280
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,310
You're giving me butterflies.

281
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,640
Yeah.

282
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,550
 Where are you? I'm done.

283
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,240
You're not going to say thank you?

284
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,020
How do you know where we live?

285
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,570
I've been here a couple times.

286
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,690
- Why? 
 - To see Teacher Joo.

287
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,000
What? You like my sister, too?

288
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,330
You bastard, are you crazy?

289
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,100
Ow! I'm a patient! That hurts.

290
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,840
Yeah, I do.

291
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,000
Noona. Noona, weren't you seeing the unemployed former chief director?

292
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,560
You even stayed in his house overnigh—

293
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,300
Go inside!

294
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,690
- Ow! 
 - Get inside.

295
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,670
- Go inside! 
 - Stop it!

296
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,160
Really? I didn't think you could do that.

297
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,650
It's really a ridiculous thing to see.

298
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,960
He'll need to be careful for a few days.

299
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,600
Yes?

300
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
Student Seo Joon's shoulder.

301
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,650
Thank you.

302
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,540
I'll be on my way.

303
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,920
Did he not hear?

304
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,350
Joo Seo Joon, that bastard!

305
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,950
Why is it you?

306
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,490
Why does it have to be you of all the people out there?

307
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,610
You think I'm easy, don't you? Why are you messing with me?

308
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,180
If it was some other jerk, I would have just killed him.

309
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,800
What?

310
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,380
But it's you.

311
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,670
What are you—

312
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,870
Lee Min Hyeok, are you okay?

313
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,420
I'm not okay so don't mess with me.

314
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Today... Don't mess with me.

315
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,980
- Lee Min Hyeok! 
 - I said not to mess with me.

316
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,810
- Min Hyeok! 
 - Are you crazy!

317
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,220
I said not to mess with me.

318
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,230
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,550
What?

320
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,990
I'm sorry.

321
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,390
For what?

322
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,800
That I wasn't a hyung to you.

323
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,490
I'm sorry that I wasn't a good hyung to you.

324
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,860
I'm going to go crazy.

325
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,690
What are "siblings"?

326
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,860
Do you think I'll be able to get my dongseng's forgiveness?

327
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,240
Is there something you did wrong?

328
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:08,330
He's way smarter and better than me so I thought he'd be fine on his own.

329
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,330
I didn't do that because of this.

330
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,280
It's all an excuse. I don't have any right to call myself his hyung.

331
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,020
Doctor!

332
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,810
I didn't do that because of this either.

333
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:36,610
It was said that he definitely died and there was no possibility he would survive.

334
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm sorry, Dong Gu!

335
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,870
I'm sorry!

336
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:49,430
My Dong Gu, how much have you resented your hyung through all those hard times?

337
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,060
Dong Gu!

338
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,390
Aren't you Dong Gu?

339
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,970
No, I'm Kim Ban Gu!

340
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,120
Kim Ban Gu?

341
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,440
 Stanford University 
 Kim Dong Gu

342
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,330
Dong Gu Kim is what it says.

343
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,690
I was a little confused for a moment.

344
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,040
My hyung was Ban Gu and I'm Dong Gu.

345
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,200
What were you talking about before?

346
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,942
Should we start again?
