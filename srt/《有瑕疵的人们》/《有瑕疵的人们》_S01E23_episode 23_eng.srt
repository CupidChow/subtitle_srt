1
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,360
- So, Lee Kang Woo, let's break up. 
 - Joo Seo Yeon!

2
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,480
Why are you being like this Seo Yeon?

3
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,690

4
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,180
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

5
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,460
Don't do this Seo Yeon, hm?

6
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,990
 It looks like you have a guest?

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,610
Who is it?

8
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,060
Excuse me?

9
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,650
Are you by chance our Kang Woo's girlfriend?

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,310
That's right. She's my girlfriend.

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,870
What? Am I wrong? You're my girl.

12
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,730
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kang Woo's mom.

13
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,590
Hello. It's nice to meet you. My name is Joo Seo Yeon.

14
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,110
Oh, you look very pretty.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,780
Ah, that's it. I was wondering why she was acting this way. It was because of you, Mom.

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,040
The reason Joo Seo Yeon is scared.

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,120
N..No!

18
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,260
It isn't? You haven't met my mom already?

19
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,190
No, it's not.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,550
Y-you. Why would I meet her?

21
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,080
This is the first time we've met, right?

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,830
Yes, this is the first time.

23
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,190
Liar.

24
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,300
It's the truth!

25
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,230
You saw her at the department store when you were with Lee Min Hyeok.

26
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,020
What I'm trying to say is... It's the first time meeting her as your mother.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,490
That's good then. Joo Seo Yeon and I were just about to break up.

28
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:05,040
She said because I was the grandson of Shinhwa Foods, so she felt burdened or something like that?

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,670
Mom, it's okay, right? For Joo Seo Yeon and I to date?

30
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,000
You aren't an uptight kind of a person, right?

31
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,450
Of c-c-course.

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,910
Don't worry. A person just needs to be healthy.

33
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,410
What else is important?

34
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,590
What are you trying to do? Why are you making it difficult for me? 
  -  Episode 23  -

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,690
Are you getting mad at me right now?

36
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,890
This situation... I'm the one who is taken aback.

37
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,240
- Lee Kwang Woo— 
 - Let's stop for today. I don't want to hear anymore.

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,790
Go.

39
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,660
I didn't realize you were going to raise problems like this behind my back.

40
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,890
That's not it. You don't have anything to worry about.

41
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,140
I will break up with Lee Kwang Woo like you told me to.

42
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,330
Are you dense?

43
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,250
If you do that right now, Kang Woo is going to blame it all on me. Didn't you see earlier?

44
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,700
- If I try to make him understand— 
 - I said no!

45
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,790
You absolutely can't break up.

46
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,840
- Excuse me? 
 - I mean, you can't break up now.

47
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,590
Do you try to make this mother and son become enemies?

48
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,590
But, I've already decided to break up with Lee Kwang Woo.

49
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,250
You really don't understand well, do you!?

50
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,860
Just date quietly for a little bit more, then break up naturally...

51
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,260
Wait.

52
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,700
What's wrong with my Kang Woo? Isn't that right?

53
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,290
Why do you keep trying to break up with my Kang Woo?

54
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,710
I can tell right away that Kang Woo really likes you. Why are you being like this?

55
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,290
Well... Like you said, I'm not someone who is good enough for Shinhwa Food.

56
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,940
Whether you are good enough or not is for us to decide.

57
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,720
So, for now, just keep dating.

58
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,190
- But– 
 - Just keep dating him!

59
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,950
My Kang Woo is a decent guy.

60
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,270
He may seem prickly, but he's got a kind heart.

61
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,490
Yes, I know.

62
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,730
Oh, then it's settled. Aigoo.

63
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,010
Then, just know that and keep on dating him.

64
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,450
I'll pay for the teas.

65
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,880
That's weird.

66
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,060
- Teacher. 
 - You startled me!

67
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,430
What are you doing?

68
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,560
By chance... have you seen a bag about this big? It belongs to Baek Jang Mi.

69
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,050
It used to be here but it's not anymore.

70
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,600
Have you noticed anything weird while staying with her?

71
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,750
You have, right?

72
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,080
It's not that.

73
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,860
I saw money in that bag.

74
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,580
Money? How much?

75
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,450
50,000 won bills - filled.

76
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,570
Hey!

77
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,830
- You– Where have you been all day? 
 - What?

78
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,470
Oh, just...

79
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,520
- Did you meet Lee Kang Woo? 
 - Yeah.

80
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,510
Were you that kind of a girl? The ones that ignore their friends because they found a boyfriend?

81
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,840
It's not like that.

82
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,470
I don't care. I'm starting to get upset. I'll be keeping an eye on you Joo Seo Yeon.

83
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,690
Do you want me to take you home?

84
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,830
No need.

85
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,620
Before she would have taken me home even if I said no.

86
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,930
I'm getting upset, Lee Kang Woo!

87
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,210
You're going to give up on me that easily?

88
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,530
How? How can you do that?

89
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,960
How can you do that Joo Seo Yeon?

90
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,970
But wait... How did Mom find out already?

91
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,960
  You really don't know anything, Hyung.

92
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,110
 What are you talking about?

93
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,360
 Whether or not someone near you is hurting or dying, Hyung.

94
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,390
Could it be?

95
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,890
Are you home?

96
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,260
What is this?

97
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,130
Why have I lived like this for so long?

98
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,370
There's nothing that I paid for myself.

99
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,540
Why did I live like this? You should have stopped me, you jerk!

100
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,550
To live right.

101
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,140
What's wrong with you?

102
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,030
I'm going to throw it all away.

103
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,930
I'm going to throw away everything that I didn't buy myself!

104
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,970
This is limited edition. Would it be better to resell it?

105
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,560
I really liked wearing this one too.

106
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,270
Oh, this would be a waste too.

107
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,480
 Aren't you getting tutored today?

108
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,620
 Teacher Ho Dol told me something came up.

109
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,670
 That idiot was stupid to get caught.

110
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,060
 Phone is not connected so it goes to the voice mail...

111
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,570
Coming to the front of the school is not enough so you came to the chief director's office.

112
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,090
Was it you who told my family about Joo Seo Yeon?

113
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,130
She asked and you know I can't lie.

114
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,130
What a great excuse.

115
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,530
Even if I didn't tell them, they would find out about it eventually.

116
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,600
It's not like my aunt wouldn't know it forever.

117
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,610
You are becoming an asshole.

118
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,980
I plan to keep it going.

119
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,290
What good comes of being the nice guy?

120
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,860
The nice guy, the nice son.

121
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,210
I didn't get any benefits from it

122
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,760
as you're well aware.

123
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,840
Do you talk to Uncle a lot?

124
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,460
Why are you all of a sudden playing the role of my brother?

125
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
Just play one role or I'll get confused.

126
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,720
If you're done, could you leave? I'm busy.

127
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,570
Don't wait.

128
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,350
For my making a mistake, it won't happen.

129
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,740
Good luck with work.

130
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,310
Why does Lee Kang Woo keep coming to the school?

131
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,450
That's what I'm saying!

132
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,050
- I'm so scared, dammit. 
  - I'm so hungry, really.

133
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,300
 Your phone is not connected so it goes to the voice mail...

134
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,110
Lee Kang Woo, really!

135
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,240
I'll protect Unni Seo Yeon.

136
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,560
 Do you feel stuffy at your office too?

137
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,060
 Director, Baek Ga Corporation's CEO's child is here.

138
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,330
 Baek Ga Corporation?

139
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,500
 Baek Gook Hwa!

140
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,540
 Who the hell are you!

141
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,920
Why is that jerk–

142
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,400
Tell him to come in.

143
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm Baek Jang Mi. Lee Kang Woo is your younger brother, right?

144
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,270
Your brother isn't a good match for Unni Seo Yeon.

145
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,200
Unni Seo Yeon is too good for him.

146
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,320
Therefore tell your brother to give up Unni Seo Yeon.

147
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,360
- Excuse me— 
 - If you let them keep dating,

148
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,070
I'm going to tell my dad to stop all business with Sinhwa Food.

149
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,130
Baek Ga Corporation is a good company, and it's true we're doing business with them.

150
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:34,160
Even if our deal gets cut, it won't really affect us.

151
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,930
On the contrary, if Baek Ga Corporation stops doing business with us, things will get difficult.

152
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,800
Will you be okay?

153
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
Pardon?

154
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,360
We have seen each other. Don't you remember?

155
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,880
 You useless wench!

156
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,770
 How could you hit your own child?

157
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,210
 She's quite small-boned. I'm pretty sure you could've subdued her.

158
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,660
 You should've attacked her back.

159
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,530
Even though you're a very good person, your brother and Unni Seo Yeon can't date.

160
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,520
They can't date.

161
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,200
Baek Jang Mi!

162
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,360
How great is the woman who Lee Kang Woo is dating?

163
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,330
Did you get hurt?

164
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,810
I'm fine.

165
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,140
Stay still.  I don't have any ulterior motive in front of a wounded person.

166
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,490
- Does it hurt? 
 - Yes.

167
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,650
How embarrassing it was that I fell down in front of students.

168
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,880
- Thank you. 
 - Your mind was somewhere else?

169
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,500
Because of Kang Woo?  That was how you got hurt, right?

170
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,840
No.  I just—

171
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,080
Hyung Kang Woo was here.

172
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,090
I got caught that I told my aunt.

173
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,580
I told her about you and Kang Woo.

174
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,060
Pardon?

175
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,440
I was sincere back then that I wouldn't interrupt your relationship.

176
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,020
When I got an opportunity, I ended up interrupting you.

177
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,500
You're disappointed in me, right?

178
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,370
Yes. a little bit.

179
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:59,170
Health Teacher that I knew wouldn't do it.  It's strange.

180
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,790
Now, you begin to realize what kind of person I am.

181
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,720
I told you I was not kind.

182
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,430
By the way,

183
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,400
why do you agonize over Hyung Kang Woo?

184
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,460
Why do you agonize over him because my aunt met you?

185
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,690
Kang Woo is only that much to you?

186
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,520
I think it's not your business.

187
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,720
Did they start drifting apart?

188
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,210
Look, you lost weight.  You were already thin.

189
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,990
- What are you doing? 
 - Why do you make desperate efforts to come to school if you act like this?

190
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,380
Will you get into big trouble if you miss a few days of school?

191
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,820
People won't be interested in someone else's matters for very long.

192
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,570
- So until the time— 
 - If I miss a day of school, my parents waste a week of their time.

193
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,160
They pay my tuition by doing farm work nights and days.

194
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
I won't miss school with only this kind of matter.

195
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,320
But your words and actions are different.

196
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
How about tutoring?  You didn't come to tutor?

197
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,530
Ah, t-that was...

198
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,920
And you just said, "only this kind of matter".

199
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,490
What is this?

200
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,430
I didn't put on my sunscreen!  What about it?

201
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,790
 Let's pretend we don't know anything.

202
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,120
 Who is he?

203
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,150
 Who is it?  What is he doing?

204
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
 Wow, look at him.

205
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,400
 What is he doing here?

206
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,200
 He is sitting over there.

207
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,190
 Wow.  Awesome.

208
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,040
 Take a picture.

209
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,700
Don't do it.  Uselessly, you'll get into difficulty too, you there.

210
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,180
"You there"?  You used to call me "Hyung-nim".

211
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,440
They're looking at me?  It's because I am handsome.

212
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,430
You're overacting.

213
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,900
Is it overacting?

214
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,020
Did you see he put his arm around his shoulder?

215
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,330
Did you see he looked at Choi Ho Dol? Ah really.

216
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,970
He even petted his hair.  What was that?

217
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,030
Wow,  what is this world going on?

218
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,170
Let me go.

219
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,860
Then do you want me to do it here?

220
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,410
- Don't harass him. 
 - Why?

221
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,560
What is he to you?

222
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,380
Nothing.

223
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,070
But if you continue to harass him, it puts me in a foul mood.

224
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,300
Why?  Why can he be okay to you but I can't?

225
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,400
How am I worse than he is?

226
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,130
Temper, your mean temper.

227
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,360
Just meet someone that considers you special and precious.

228
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,950
It wouldn't be me.

229
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,020
Where is he?  He didn't answer phone calls all day long.

230
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,540
You just got caught!

231
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,370
You!

232
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,430
What is your identity?

233
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,980
Unni.

234
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,970
Even if you cry, it won't work.

235
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,420
What should we do for Unni Seo Yeon?

236
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,060
What should we do for Unni Seo Yeon?

237
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,800
Kim Mi Kyeong!

238
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,370
- Who are you? 
 - Huh?

239
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,320
Who are you so you pretend to know me?

240
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,290
Why are you acting like this?

241
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,160
Ah, I'm sorry.  I was dating Lee Kang Woo.

242
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,730
Oh, I see.  So you dated Lee Kang Woo.

243
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,960
Huh?  Yeah.

244
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,980
You really!

245
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,540
Are we friends?

246
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,400
Did I have to hear your story from Baek Jang Mi, you bad wench?

247
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,530
Mi Kyeong.

248
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,920
I wanted to tell you about it 100 times or 1,000 times.

249
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,660
But why didn't you tell me?

250
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,200
I knew for sure that you were getting more upset than me.

251
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,230
You sure know it.

252
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,440
But it was not Lee Kang Woo's fault.

253
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,250
So don't think the other way.  You like Lee Kang Woo.

254
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,360
I'm not confident.

255
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,670
Whenever I see Lee Kang Woo, if I hadn't asked my parents to go with me,

256
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,450
if I hadn't rejected Lee Kang Woo's confession,

257
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,410
I'm not confident I wouldn't think like that.

258
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,290
Then I'm afraid I might think like this,

259
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:32,670
if Lee Kang Woo hadn't confessed to me back then,

260
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,030
I'm so scared that I might dump all my guilt on Lee Kang Woo.

261
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:50,090
It's not right for me to meet Lee Kang Woo with this kind of mind.

262
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,500
Can't you just tell him the truth?

263
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,070
- No. 
 - Why not?

264
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,880
If you part like this, Lee Kang Woo won't understand why.

265
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,850
It's not like you met him without knowing he was the grandson of Sinhwa Food.

266
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,780
It'll be better if only I become a crazy wench.

267
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,480
So why do you have to be like that?

268
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,340
Sometimes, honesty can be the best way.

269
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,690
If Lee Kang Woo finds out, he'll feel sorry even if it's not his fault.

270
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,730
He'll have a guilty feeling.

271
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,110
Because he is kind, he'll be like that.

272
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,690
I'd like him just to hate me and curse at me, rather than feel sorry and guilty.

273
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,760
Just thinking I'm an unfortunate person, he shouldn't have met me in the first place.

274
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,810
Hey!

275
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,810
Lee Kang Woo should not know about this.  Never.

276
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,800
Who on earth worries whom right now?

277
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,320
You worry yourself.

278
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,460
So, she didn't like you because you were ugly.  She didn't like you because you were handsome.

279
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,880
But she liked you.  Now you're saying she doesn't like you because you're a chaebol's grandson?

280
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,000
After I heard what you said, I realized I did very wrong.

281
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,350
That I look like this and that I'm a chaebol's grandson...

282
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,030
Why do you like her so much?

283
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,680
Because she is Joo Seo Yeon.

284
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,930
That's it?

285
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,030
What more do you need?

286
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,760
Even so, you can't abandon your being a chaebol's grandson.

287
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,750
I can't do it?

288
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,170
I'm not interested in the company anyway.

289
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:59,200
If I don't need anything but her,  will I be crazy?

290
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,140
Stop it, you punk!  Just do it in moderation!

291
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,230
Count your blessings, you punk!

292
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,430
She seems too emotional now.

293
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:28,250
I think you need to give her some time to think quietly.

294
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:33,050
Please don't meet her for a while.

295
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,010
But do you think that's the only reason?

296
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,050
I mean, as I heard about her from you,

297
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,220
I don't think she is the type that gets scared of your mother's few words.

298
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,810
You mean there might be another reason?

299
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,200
Well, there is a possibility.

300
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,100
