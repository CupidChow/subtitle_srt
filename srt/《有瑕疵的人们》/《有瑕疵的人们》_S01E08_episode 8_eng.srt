 Episode 8

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,420
What is that?

3
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,900
Oh my!  What is this?

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm sorry, Director.

5
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,050
What is this?

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,010
That is... My husband is working late and mother-in-law is sick so...

7
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,540
I'll take him out soon.  I'm sorry.

8
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,540
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,870
♫  Party, party, party, party, party  ♫

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,440
♫  Everybody rock and roll   ♫

11
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,790
When I saw Team Leader for the first time, I thought he was a model who came to contract with us.

12
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,260
What a waste if he doesn't take advantage of his looks.

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,020
Team Leader is very popular, isn't he?  Does he have a girlfriend?

14
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,710
He is very popular.

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,660
That, that crazy punk.

16
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,510
Hey, you punk.  What are you doing acting like that?

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,280
You didn't even meet women in America either.

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Is that still alive?

19
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,480
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,240
Where are you going? Hey! Hey! Hey!

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,730
At this rate, is he going to enter Nirvana?

22
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,110
It's not here. Not.

23
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,130
It'll be great if you're able to find something in your house.

24
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,150
Just take a picture of him and send it to me.

25
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,130
What are you going to do with Park Hyeon Soo's picture?

26
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,420
 I'm going to upload it on the middle school alumni cafe.

27
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,200
Probably, at least one person would know what Park Hyeon Soo is doing for a living.

28
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,710
I just sent it.

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,330
Really, is he an egg ghost?

30
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,030
Anyhow, you take very bad pictures.  Forget it.  I'll take a picture when I get there next time.

31
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,220
By the way, there is no Lee Kang Woo's picture.

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,400
 Before he graduated, he went to study abroad.

33
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,040
 Was it he was in 8th grade?  It was after the pants-pooping incident.

34
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,130
 Award 
 National Junior Tract Competition 
 2nd Place: Joo Seo Yeon :200M

35
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,760
He was really nice.

36
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,300
What made him change so much?

37
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,400

38
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,640
 If a student says, "you're ugly

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,180
 and fat"  right to someone's face,

40
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,580
 what kind of lesson will you give to that mean student?

41
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:12,110
 I don't like you because you're ugly and fat.

42
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,900
Why does he still keep that in mind?

43
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,270
He did wrong first.

44
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:25,850
♫  Meeting  by chance, a person who leaves me only sadness  ♫

45
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,850
♫  Becoming a small candle in my heart  ♫

46
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:40,310
♫  When I miss you, I close my eyes  ♫

47
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,580
♫  I want to shout to call you  ♫

48
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:59,100
♫  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♫

49
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,300
♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore   ♫

50
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
♫  This night, this night  ♫

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:20,100
♫  If I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

52
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,000
♫  All of this, all of this   ♫

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,100
♫  I want to give you all of my love  ♫

54
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,700
I must've been crazy.  Must've been.  How can I bring up myself by 100 ranks?

55
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,070
Oh my goodness!  You scared me!

56
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,910
Light! Light! Light! Light!

57
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,780
There is a light to be turned on!

58
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,600
You said I was a dog.  Have you seen a dog turning on a light?

59
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,060
Ah crazy!

60
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,600
 Joo Seo Joon

61
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,190
Did you see?  Dogs also turn the lights on.

62
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,410
What a lunatic!

63
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,160
Why?  What again?

64
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,250
The only thing the youngest has is his good-looking face.

65
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,030
It's so obvious that he can't live like a human if he doesn't even become a celebrity.

66
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,630
Probably, he may live off us for the rest of his life, like a leech.

67
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,290
You don't have to be in that agency.  There are so many agencies.

68
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,040
I would get so embarrassed.

69
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,870
Everyone at my school knows that I'm a trainee at the HS.  Do you think it's only at school?

70
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,590
If someone types 'HS trainee' on the internet, my pictures will pop up.

71
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,090
But if they heard I was kicked out because of my grades now,  how embarrassing.

72
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,620
Right, you punk!  You shouldn't have bragged about yourself so much!

73
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,370
You have to bring up yourself by 100 ranks?

74
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,880
Then he has to be on within 10th place in his grade class?

75
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,040
No.  100th place.

76
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,380
That's what I mean.  He said he would have to bring up by 100—

77
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,830
- No way...   By chance, are you in 200th place? 
 - Yeah.

78
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,300
How many students are there?

79
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,580
There are 230 students in his grade class.  If you exclude the students with special needs and with a long term absence,

80
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,630
who actually don't affect their grade ranks—

81
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,640
I'm either white or black.  If I'm not on the first place then I—

82
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,530
You work at the same school.  You can't take out the questionnaires stealthily, can you?

83
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,490
Ah, there is a way!  The oldest brother is the best!

84
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,920
Don't be sarcastic.

85
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,790
I would steal the questionnaires and make Seo Joon be in first place at school.

86
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,790
Then I would show up in the media by leaking the questionnaires, be buried and get fired.

87
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,740
Seo Joon would get kicked out of school.

88
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,770
Don't be sarcastic.

89
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,350
Get him a tutor.  Tutoring.

90
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,590
He said, "tutoring".

91
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,160
Good idea.

92
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,100
Joo Hee!  You too!  Receive tutoring with him together.

93
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,710
Pardon?

94
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,270
 Urgent Want of a Tutor! 
 We are looking for a tutor who can bring up a 11th student by 100 ranks.  He has a pure brain.  Help us.

95
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,120
Ten minutes prior to reporting to work.

96
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,680
She is sharp on time.

97
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,410
Nursery service?

98
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,430

99
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,090
It says snacks and dinners are provided too.

100
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,760
- It's good. 
 - Right. It's so good.

101
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,380
Oh.  Director.

102
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,780
Director, thank you.  You did that, right?

103
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,580
That one.  Nursery service for the employees who work late.

104
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,750
As we expected, you understand our female workers' situation very well.

105
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,580
Don't think of working late.

106
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,420
Just think of your work done during your regular working hours.

107
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,570
She's really so full of herself.

108
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,030
Even though she's full of herself but cool.

109
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,480
That's why I'm even more annoyed.

110
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Saying she is so full of herself but cool...

111
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,370
I like her even more.

112
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,620
One, two, one, two,

113
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,390
one, two, one, two.

114
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,790
One, two, one, two, one, two,

115
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,110
one, two...

116
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,170
I'm going crazy.  Joo Hee goes to practice every early morning.

117
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,000
Does Chief Director have to approve?

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If she participates in the competition without school head's approval, she'll be disqualified.  Disqualified!

119
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,040
Does it make sense an innocent student got affected in a negative way because of a teacher's private situation?

120
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,350
Who on earth is Lee Kang Woo?  How has he not been to school for four days?

121
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,380
Are you sure you wrapped up well by speaking with him on the welcome party?

122
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,970
I think somehow Lee Kang Woo tries to mess you up.

123
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,280
Yes, I did well.

124
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,930
Think carefully.  Did he tell you on his own mouth that he would sign it or get along with you?

125
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,940
On his own mouth, in person?

126
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,970
I said so—

127
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,660
 You can sign it off tomorrow, right?

128
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,230
  Don't follow me.

129
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,740
This bastard!

130
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,590
How dare he made a pun with me?

131
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,310
What a fool.

132
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,070
 Min Hyeon

133
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,660
 The call you're trying is not answered so this call will be forwarded to the voice mail...

134
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,740
 Hyung, is there something happened?

135
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,950
 By chance, are you sick?

136
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,320
 Chief Director doesn't come to work so the school matter isn't carried on as it was planned.

137
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,590
Can't you give that to me?

138
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,390
I got stressed so I'm craving something sweet.

139
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,060
If you want to have some snacks, please come to me anytime.

140
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,330
Thank you.

141
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,130
l succeeded in luring her.

142
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,400
Call Lee Kang Woo and tell him to meet you.

143
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,600
What?  Why do I need to meet him?

144
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,820
Once you meet him, then you can beg or threaten him.

145
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,270
- It's enough. 
 - What if Lee Kang Woo keeps not showing up at the school?

146
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,720
You said Joo Hee practices running every early morning.

147
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,070
I don't know his phone number either.

148
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,640
What?  What is this?

149
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,390
 Hello?

150
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,150
Hello?

151
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,310
 Hello?

152
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,430
What is this?

153
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,240
Hello!

154
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,570
Who is this?

155
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,010
I-I... am Joo Seo Yeon.

156
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,210
Why are you not coming to school?  Are you perhaps sick?

157
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,460
Let's meet.  The track team's budget proposal is really important.

158
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,190
- You meet me and listen to me. 
 - Okay.

159
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,830
 Joo Seo Yeon.  Your situation must be urgent.

160
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,430
Hello?  Did you hang up?

161
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,950
H-Hello?

162
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,830
Well...  When should I see you?

163
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,740
I'm okay with right now.

164
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,710
What should I do?  I'm very tired right now.

165
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,810
If you really have an urgent matter, you may come to my house.

166
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,210
Well, I don't think that you want to do so, though.

167
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,870
- I'll go! 
 - What?

168
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,920
 I said I would.  Can you send me your address by text?

169
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah.  Yeah.

170
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,330
She is going to come to a man's house so late at night?

171
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,220
Joo Seo Yeon!  Are you out of mind?

172
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,020
What's the matter with him?  He said that he would meet me.

173
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,140
By the way, how did you find out Lee Kang Woo's phone number?

174
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,240
Isn't it basic that staff know their boss's phone number?

175
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,790
I asked stealthily his phone number to the chief of school affairs, Park, by bringing a cup of coffee.

176
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,040
- I got his address.
 - Let's go.

177
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,290
You try to persuade him. If it doesn't work, give him a lot of alcohol.

178
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,250
- Alcohol? 
 - When I saw him at the welcome party, he didn't drink.

179
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,530
When I look at him, he looks like he has a low tolerance for alcohol.

180
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:20,220
Make him sign when he gets drunk and not in his right mind.  Like making someone sign on the card's bill.

181
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,840
- Oh, customer, you got so drunk. You should pay.  Please sign here. 
 - Oh, okay.

182
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,520
- Wow. 
 - Wow.

183
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,560
I almost signed here, not suspecting.

184
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,660
Nothing to lose.  Nothing to lose.

185
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,510
Making him sign here.  Making him sign here without losing anything.

186
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,010
Noona, I'm hungry.

187
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,560
Please marry soon.  Whether you marry together or at different times.

188
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,130
The second brother took his car?

189
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,090
No, the car was parked there.

190
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,000
- I'll bring a car key.  You'll be there. 
 - Okay.

191
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,490
I said I'm hungry!

192
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,630
Prepare your meal yourself on your own, you punk!

193
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,860
Your sister and this teacher are very busy right now.

194
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,690
Oh, right.  Park Hyeon Soo's picture.

195
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,100

196
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,090
This mister—

197
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,200
What?  Do you know him?

198
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Yes.  In our agency—

199
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,910
If you say your agency, is it HS Center?  If it's HS, HS is the initial of Hyeon Soo?

200
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,800
He is our cleaning mister.

201
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,850
Cleaner?

202
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,080
Ah, it's really annoying.

203
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,520
 Joo Seo Yeon.  Joo Seo Yeon.  Joo Seo Yeon.

204
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,660
Is she really going to come?

205
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,830
 I have something to tell you.

206
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,890
 What is your address?  I'll go to you right now.

207
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,670
No, I'm sure she won't be here, like back then she didn't although she said to come.

208
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,690
Joo Seo Yeon is always Joo Seo Yeon.  I don't care!

209
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,150
Lee Kang Woo surely is a grandson of chaebol family.

210
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,300
What are you doing?  It's time for you to go in.

211
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,300
She's really here!

212
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,660
I didn't know what to buy so...

213
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,370
Your house is so great.

214
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,540
 She even bought alcohol drinks?

215
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,710
How are a third-generation chaebol and cleaner friends?

216
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,600
Is it like a prince and a beggar or a young master and a servant or something?

217
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,290
Then what on earth were the clothes that wrapped his body?

218
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,580
They were from Lee Kang Woo's money!

219
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,410
Even though he is like that, he ignores me?

220
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,610
He even knows his passcode.

221
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,430
As I expected, they have that kind of relationship.

222
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,480
Bus rental expense, lodging, meals... I tried to keep the budget at a minimum.

223
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,530
You really take time to read only five pages–really a loooong time.

224
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,570
No.  I meant you're so meticulous.

225
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,140
  Look here. They say there is supposed to be a hole  here,

226
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,290
 but there is no hole.

227
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,480
Hey, you Kim Mi Kyeong.  You're really something.

228
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,130
Now, you even searched and came to Kang Woo's house?

229
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,380
You tried to do something by getting into his house after you found out he was a grandson of Shinhwa Food?

230
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,340
Hello, are you introducing yourself?

231
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,350
Hello, do you think you can be matched with Kang Woo?

232
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,700
That's why I keep telling him not to thoughtlessly tell anybody about his family just anywhere.

233
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,200
He would never know what kinds of blowflies might swamp all over him.

234
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,290
- What?  Blowfly? HEY! 
 - Ah, you scared me!

235
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,780
- What?! 
 - You're pooping through your mouth!

236
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,860
Hey, you bastard!  I'm a person who tried to put some effort at least.

237
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,220
To marry a good man from a good family, I studied very hard, got into a renowned private college, and became a teacher as a permanent position.

238
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,320
I live my life confidently with the money I've earned!

239
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,780
But how about you?

240
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,710
- What about me? 
 - You're sucking Lee Kang Woo's blood as a lover right now!

241
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,060
What?

242
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,290
Ah, you're not a lover?  Then you're sponsored by him?

243
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,350
When you're like that, how dare you nitpick about me?  What did you say? Blowfly or something?

244
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,860
Wait!  Wait.  What do you mean a lover or a sponsor?

245
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,040
Ah, sorry.  If you didn't want to reveal your sexual orientation, I apologize to you in advance.

246
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,470
But you're the one who picked a fight first.

247
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,810
No, no, wait!  Hold on!  That... with Kang Woo...

248
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,990
And I... Why... How...?

249
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,020
Seo Yeon saw Kang Woo and you were at the gay bar.

250
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,770
- What? 
- Don't worry.  I respect what you are.

251
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,490
I'll never tell anybody either.

252
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,050
Anyhow, I didn't come here with an ulterior motive.

253
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,520
I came here to accompany Seo Yeon since she had something to tell Lee Kang Woo about a school matter.

254
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,860
No way I would do something to a man who isn't interested in women, would I?

255
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,980
 Surprisingly, this... would be solved easily.

256
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,590
 If they think Lee Kang Woo and I are lovers, they won't plug away at us.

257
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,890
Hey!  Are you listening to me?

258
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,200
Alright.  Well...

259
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,440
Since you knew it already, I don't need to hide it.

260
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,460
Right, you're right.  Kang Woo and I are...

261
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,660
in such a relationship.

262
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,040
Alright.

263
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,960
Excuse me, if you don't mind, could you help me to set up a tent?

264
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,540
Oh, okay.  Let's go.

265
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,490
Thank you.

266
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,590
Excuse me...  May I use a bathroom?

267
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,220
To the house where a man lives alone, at this late time...

268
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,370
With a lot of drinks...

269
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,320
You just have this as an excuse, Joo Seo Yeon!

270
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,430
That punk.  He should've treated me with some snacks.  Anyway, rich rascals are cheaper.

271
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,610
Where on earth is the bathroom?

272
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,160
Well... I was looking for a bathroom.

273
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,290
That way.

274
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,640
 You can draw this kind of stuff?  Awesome!

275
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,650
 You want to become a designer?

276
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,570
 Well... Just...

277
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,720
 You're so cool, Lee Kang Woo.

278
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,860
He's still designing.

279
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,810
Lee Kang Woo hasn't changed in some parts.

280
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,380
 Big news!  Park Hyeon Soo admitted on his own mouth that Lee Kang Woo and he are in a relationship.

281
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,980
Did you review everything?

282
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,170
No.  I'll read this twice more.

283
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,310
 I'm sure you would just give up and leave if I went this far, Joo Seo Yeon.

284
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,470
Alright.  Just take time to read it.

285
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,460
 Damn.

286
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,010
 When I look at you like this,  I can still see your old face remaining.

287
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,890
 What is this?  Do you try to look at me in such an explicit gaze?

288
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,420
 What should you do, Joo Seo Yeon?  I'm not a person who falls for someone with such a gaze.

289
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,020
 I'm a person who didn't even glance at so many women who were interested in me.

290
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,120
 Do you think you're different from them?

291
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,680
 On purpose!  You did on purpose, didn't you?

292
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,580
 The beer bottle was just fine but why did it explo—

293
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,780
 What a waste!

294
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,790
♬  I love it when you call me señorita  ♬

295
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,970
♬  I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya  ♬

296
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,020
♬  But every touch is ooh la la la  ♬

297
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,150
♬  It's true, la la la  ♬

298
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,180
♬  Ooh, I should be running  ♬

299
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,120
♬  Ooh, you keep me coming for you  ♬

300
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,330
Yes, Aunt.

301
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:52,320
Yes. Hyung hasn't come to school for a few days.  Since I'm in front of his house, I'll check whether he's okay.

302
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,840
Don't worry.  I don't think something bad happened to him.

303
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,660
What on earth is the part you can not understand?

304
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,070
I'll explain it.

305
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,210
Which one?  What part is it?

306
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,660
♬  I love it when you call me señorita  ♬

307
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,640
Just leave!

308
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,190
Huh?

309
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,390
I told you to leave.

310
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,820
How about signing?  If someone read it that many times, even a five-year-old could understand it.

311
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,220
Why don't you sign it?

312
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,530
No way. Is it because of that old matter, you're not signing it?

313
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,270
It was not that you confessed because you really liked me back then!

314
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,800
- You tried to put me on blast by betting on me with your friends— 
 - What nonsense—

315
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,980
It's strong!

316
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,060
Why?

317
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,040
 I'm doomed.

318
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:45,720

319
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,820
 Love with Flaws  
 ♫  I just happened to meet you by chance   ♫

320
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,240
 Ah, it's so humiliating.

321
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,120
 You can act so cool with that matter?

322
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,510
 I'll show you clearly how low I can go.

323
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,250
 You're completely a scumbag.

324
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,950
 Do you have a girlfriend, Health Teacher?  She may be near you.

325
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,690
 I also think she is near me.

326
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,580
 I'm telling you, don't get close with Lee Min Hyeok.

327
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,890
 What's this all about?

328
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,990
 Do you like it?

329
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,670
 I hope you will stay by me, Joo Seo Yeon.

330
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,700
♫  You just left me abruptly  ♫
