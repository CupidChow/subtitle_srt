 Episode 17

2
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,770

3
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,330
Is this really the end?

4
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,090
What is it with you?

5
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,650
Who are you to bother me?

6
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,430
Why are you making me worry about you?  Why are you making me think of you?

7
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,070
Why do you show yourself up when I don't want to see you?  Why?

8
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,930
You don't have to see me if you don't want to.  Just stay as you are.

9
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,620
I'll make you not see me.

10
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,730
Were you opening your eyes?

11
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,140
Joo Seo Yeon.

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm going crazy, really.

13
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,030
You startled me!

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,890
What is it?  You said you would be here tomorrow.

15
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,830
-  What about you, Hyung? 
 - Me?

16
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,530
Chief Director.  I'm the chief director.

17
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,120
Chief director should follow a big school event like this.

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,540
- You're saying you are here as a chief director? 
 - Yeah.

19
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,400
Looking at you, I just wonder whether I should hide I'm one of Shinhwa Food family.

20
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,990
You punk.

21
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,280
Yes.

22
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,430
I just arrived at the airport.  I think I'll be there in 30 minutes by taxi.

23
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,420
 Okay.

24
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,050
What's wrong with your voice?  Is there something happened?

25
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,930
No, nothing.

26
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,840
What is this?

27
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,590
 Come quickly!  Come as soon as possible! Please!

28
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,180
 Something must've happened!

29
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,010
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,920
Let's go.

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,520
Teacher!

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,050
- Joo Seo Joon? 
 - Kim Mi Kyeong?

33
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,130
Park Hyeon Soo?

34
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Car is ready, President.

35
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,980
President?!

36
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,520
Why are you here?

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,130
Ah, that...  I was selected as a backup dancer for High-Seven.

38
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,290
He is a president?  You said he was a cleaning person.

39
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,210
That's what I'm saying. I saw our president first time today.  I was so shocked that I almost fell.

40
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,450
What a crap are you taking?  I really believed what you said so I made such a fuss to him.

41
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,020
- Hey, Seo Joon!  President is waiting for you to come.  Come quickly. 
- Yes.

42
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,360
- Teacher, see you later. 
 - Okay.

43
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,990
HS Entertainment is really from the initials of Hyeon Soo out of Park Hyeon Soo?

44
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,290
Where are you going?  I'll take you there on our way.

45
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,440
No thanks!  I can take a taxi.

46
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,120
You have money to burn, really.

47
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,180
You think little of taxi fare.

48
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,570
Get in.

49
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,970
 From Mi Kyeong:  Wow.

50
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,520
 They said Park Hyeon Soo is a president of HS Entertainment.

51
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,840
When I look at her, I don't think her phone was out of order.

52
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,970
Was it like she didn't answer my phone calls especially?

53
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,420
Well, I didn't have any business to talk on the phone with you.

54
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,510
Where are you going?

55
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,120
Please go to Shine Beach Resort.

56
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,370
If you are going there...

57
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,060
It's really nice!

58
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,070
That's what I'm saying.  It looks like there is a beach in front of the hotel.

59
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,350
Hyung.  Let's make sure to debut.

60
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,840
After debut, we travel like this, and get popular,

61
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,980
and make money, too.

62
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,640
Got it.  I got it.

63
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,940
What is this?  Didn't you go to the track competition?

64
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,090
Is your lodging possibly here?

65
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,100
- Yeah. 
 - Oh my.

66
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,410
Wait a minute!  Then my sister is here too?

67
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,250
Yeah.

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,250
Over there.

69
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,860
I didn't tell her that I would come here.

70
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,010
You, Lee Joo Hee, act like you don't know anything.

71
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,020
Hyung.  Let's go quickly.

72
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,160
Kim Mi Kyeong!

73
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,800
Health Teacher, what happened?

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,210
You said you would arrive tomorrow.

75
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,360
I finished my business earlier than I thought. By the way, Teacher Kim Mi Kyeong will be here too?

76
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,530
It just happened in that way.

77
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,970
Hyung Kang Woo is here too.

78
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,660
W-Well,  t-that wasn't I asked him to come with us.

79
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,840
And Lee Kang Woo changed our lodging without asking, too.

80
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,640
It's good.  I was also bothered a little bit with our lodging.

81
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,020
If I had known this would happen, I should've asked to change lodging first.

82
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,290
Don't mention it.  We're really thankful just for you to come all the way down here like this.

83
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,200
- Ah, would you come in? 
 - Pardon?

84
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,180
Ah, I think the students are hungry.

85
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,170
Right.  I almost forgot it.

86
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,380
I made a reservation for dinner nearby.

87
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,390
Let's go.

88
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,780
You may catch a cold.  The night at the seaside is cold.

89
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,960
And your condition tomorrow is very important as well.

90
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,230
Is that so?

91
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,180
Then wait for ten minutes, no, five minutes.

92
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,550
Well—

93
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,270
That, that, that! What is that?

94
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,820
Hello, everybody!

95
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,240
You missed me this much?

96
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,870
Hurry and take seats.

97
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,200
If you need more, order it more.  And enjoy!

98
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,860
- Yes. 
- Yes.

99
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,190
If you ate too heavily, it could affect tomorrow's competition.  So eat lightly and well-balanced.

100
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,740
- Yes. 
 - Yes.  We'll enjoy.

101
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,170
Let's begin.

102
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,230
I need to go to bathroom.

103
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,380
Yeah, just advertise you're going!  Advertise.

104
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,690
Ah, my stomach hurts.  B-Bathroom.

105
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,770
These punks.  We're in the middle of eating!

106
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,580
Let's eat.  Eat first and get strong, then we can beat or hit them.

107
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,620
- Pardon? 
 - I'm about 70% on your side.

108
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,740
Have a lot.

109
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,840
What is it with him?

110
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,230
Ah, really.  Ah, seriously.

111
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,770
My fate was jinxed?

112
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,190
How come so many weird people are around me?

113
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,890
It's weird.  Everything is weird.

114
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,890
Are you being bothered by me?

115
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,590
It's good.  Joo Seo Yeon is bothered by me.

116
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,380
Don't do it.  I have to focus on tomorrow's competition.

117
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,230
- So— 
 - I got it.  I'll stay quiet...

118
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,200
Until tomorrow.

119
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,640
After that, I don't know how I will act.

120
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,880
- Pardon? 
- I have held back too much

121
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,990
for fifteen years.

122
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,860
I'll go to my room first so take the time to eat your meal.

123
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,420
I don't like you to skip a meal.

124
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,850
Hey, what is this pillow?

125
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,280
Hey, this makes me sleep well. You brought it, right?

126
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,940
Are you going to act like this even when you came down here?

127
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,950
Why do I need to spend money unnecessarily on a room when I'm going to sleep only one night?

128
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,840
We can just lie down roughly and sleep together.

129
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,900
Honey, come here.

130
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,130
Well, I like this side, too.

131
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,740
I need to leave early tomorrow morning so let's be quiet.

132
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,460
If you needed to complain, get a different room.

133
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,160
A manager should do work for them but why does the president follow them and makes such a fuss to me?

134
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,770
Instead of hiring a manager, I can just work on my feet.

135
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,080
Where are you going to spend money after you earn and save all that money?

136
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,800
Where on earth?!

137
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,620
Aigoo.

138
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,050
What an enemy!

139
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,520
She shouldn't lose sleep tonight.

140
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,810
What is it?

141
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,250
You brought it all the way here?

142
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,890
Of course. If you get lazy even a little bit, you'll look old in one shot.

143
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,150
Tell me what happened.

144
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,110
W-What are you talking?

145
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,970
By the way, Park Hyeon Soo is Seo Joon's company's president?

146
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,730
I think so.

147
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,200
How come your reaction is not as good as I expected?  I thought you would like it.

148
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,490
Hey, I do have my pride.

149
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,090
Even if Park Hyeon Soo is a billionaire, I'll say, no thank you.

150
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,580
So tell me what happened while I wasn't with you?

151
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,290
N-No, w-what do you mean happened?

152
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,870
Let's sleep.

153
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,010
Really.

154
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,910
S**t.  Tell me!

155
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,540
Ah, I'm sorry.  I thought you fell asleep.

156
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,000
Am I a fish so I can fall asleep within ten seconds?

157
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,040
Sorry, sorry.  I won't make any noise.

158
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
Did you kiss?

159
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
It's a very obvious course after getting confessed.

160
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,780
Is it obvious?

161
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,570
Mostly.

162
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,120
Ah, it's obvious.

163
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,910
Did you like it?

164
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,130
I think it must not have been bad if you didn't slap his face.

165
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,380
Did you slap his face?

166
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,490
N-No.

167
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,020
Then what is the problem?

168
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,990
I don't know.

169
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,620
Hey, don't worry.

170
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,020
If you don't like him, forget about him.  Kissing once is not a big deal.

171
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,390
Ah!  I want to kiss too!

172
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,980
Just, just kissing.

173
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,220
Be quiet please.  The students might hear you.

174
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm jealous of you.  Just jealous.

175
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,150
 May I see you for a bit?

176
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,090
 I have something to tell you.

177
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,380
Joo Seo Yeon?

178
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,150
What is it?  Something to tell me.

179
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,370
Why are you like that?

180
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,420
No way... Did you come here like that, worrying that I would do something to you, right?

181
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,080
I-If you don't have anything to say, I'm leaving.

182
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,050
Here.

183
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,790
It makes you fall sleep well.  Don't lose your sleep.

184
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,440
Sleep soundly.

185
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,790
I'm leaving.

186
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,480
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning!

187
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,230
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yes!

188
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,570
- How is your condition? 
 - Good!

189
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,790
Have a water bottle.

190
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,470
Let's go.

191
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,310
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

192
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,810
Cheers!

193
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,930
Let's buy coffee on the way.  I didn't sleep well so I can't focus.

194
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,170
Are you going too, Older Cousin?

195
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,970
Of course!

196
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,940
- Yes? 
 - You need to come over here now.

197
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,990
Where is there?

198
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,050
High Seven's performance place.  Our stylists got into an accident just now.

199
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,790
What?

200
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,800
Did anyone get hurt?

201
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,670
Luckily, no one got hurt.

202
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,910
I think the situation is that no one can come over here right now.  We don't have any stage costumes or anything.

203
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,890
Where do you need me?

204
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,530
It's crazy.  Really.

205
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,130
Hey, hey, you're here.

206
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,850
- Hello! 
 - Hello!

207
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,140
Most suits look similar so just let's put some points on them.

208
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,080
Luckily, you found something.

209
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,200
Where is there a place that doesn't sell suits in Korea?

210
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,320
- Where are High Seven members? 
 - Everyone went to the bathroom.  They'll be back soon.

211
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,130
You, let's start first.  One at a time comes to me to fit the suits and the rest get makeup.

212
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,190
Make-up?  Who would do it?

213
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,080
Who wants to start first?

214
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,110
♫  After all I pretend getting bothered   ♫

215
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,330
♫  You are earnestly waiting for me, such as a person  ♫

216
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,300
Aigoo.

217
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,990
Who are you?

218
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,000
I thought you live idle with your family money.

219
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,900
It's true that I'm living idle with my family money.

220
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,250
I'm jealous of you.  You can do what you want to do as a hobby.

221
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,380
Even so, I can't tell it's a hobby.

222
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,490
Some place between hobby and living?

223
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,670
Oh, it's almost time for finishing the competition.

224
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,230
Behave properly.

225
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,680
If Seo Yeon gets treated badly, even a little bit, I'll take her

226
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,330
before she becomes forty years old.

227
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,420
What do you mean?

228
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,310
- There is something like that. 
 - So what is that something?

229
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,530
You don't need to know.

230
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,800
What is that?  Huh?  I'll help you.  What is it?

231
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,430
I think Joo Hee pulled herself together because of you, Teacher Joo.

232
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,920
That's really a relief.

233
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,990
The students did as well as we expected so we can hang in there for a while.

234
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,070
Lee Kang Woo... I mean Chief Director said

235
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,940
he would decide whether he would keep the track team or not, depending on the results of this meet.

236
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,040
It won't happen that way so don't worry.

237
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,220
As you said, let's work for a long time in this school.

238
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,890
Mi Kyeong, Joo Hee got the first place.

239
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,110
How fast she was.

240
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,000
It looked like I was watching myself in my prime.

241
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,590
Maybe, she was not as good as I used to be?

242
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,680
Anyway, she placed first.

243
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,140
I don't want to leave.

244
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,340
Of course, it's so good when you eat, sleep, and play around with someone else's money.

245
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,140
If you become a wife of Chaebol member later, please take me as your second husband.

246
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,980
By the way, did you bring only one suitcase?

247
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,480
Yes.  Why are you asking?

248
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,540
There is no space to put all of your stuff.

249
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,100
Leave it.  I'll do it.

250
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,760
Can you bring my stuff from the bathroom?

251
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,160
Huh?  Yeah.

252
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,140
How did you?

253
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,770
Until yesterday, I was 70% on the side of the person from Hanguk University.

254
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,830
But I changed my mind to 60% verse 40% today.

255
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,850
I mean Lee Kang Woo...

256
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,770
He is not as hopeless as I thought.

257
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,590
 Shinhwa High School, Track Team

258
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,120
Wait, wait, stop, stop!

259
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,140
Ajeossi, open the door, please!

260
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,760
You have a lot of seats.  Get on, get on!

261
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,020
- Hey, Park Hyeon Soo! 
 - Get in. Get in.

262
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,690
Get in. Get in.

263
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,430
Get in, get in. This way.

264
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,840
- This way. 
 - Ah you!

265
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,590
How did you get here?

266
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,570
Right back at you!  I came here after getting approval from the oldest brother.

267
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,860
Get in!  Get in!

268
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,470
- Is that seat occupied? 
 - N-No.

269
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,540
Wait!  Joo Seo Yeon, you sit over there.

270
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,570
Yes, sit over there so you can be comfortable.

271
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,940
Excuse me, excuse me.

272
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,390
You can sit spaciously.

273
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,410
Yes.  Thank you.

274
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,150
I almost missed this bus.  It was a close call.

275
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,570
Of course, I should be there, CEO Choi.

276
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,950
No.  I know better than my father.

277
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,210
Yes, see you then.

278
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,080
This person!  He acts like this every time.

279
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,870
 Joo Won Jae

280
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,030
Yes?

281
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,990
If any problem, please call me anytime.

282
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,980
Oh!  You already know my personal information, right?

283
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,260
Do you need money?

284
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,410
You already paid the deposit and the balance, all of it, at one shot by cash.

285
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,870
The reason you targeted me.

286
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,040
There must be a lot of prettier and younger women.  Why do you go out of your way to me?

287
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,820
You need money, right?

288
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,740
You're very objective to yourself.

289
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,510
Yes, well, my final goal was money but I got to like your look, too.

290
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,010
You also know that you're pretty.

291
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,850
If you need money, don't you want to have two jobs?

292
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,480
- Pardon? 
 - When I look at you,

293
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,610
it seems you can use your body well.

294
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,460
Let me use your body.

295
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,900
 Health Teacher Lee Min Hyeok and Lee Kang Woo: Rivals!

296
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,510
Unni is using this makeup.  That's why she is so pretty.

297
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,080
I'm going to buy some too.

298
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,880
 Mother

299
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,180
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

300
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,230
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

301
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,850
Are you asleep?

302
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,630
Are you really asleep? 
 ♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?   ♫

303
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,020
♫  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

304
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,730
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop  ♫

305
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,530
♫  Whenever I look at you  ♫

306
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,540
♫  What’s wrong with me?   ♫

307
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,130
Let's have a drink.

308
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,440
I heard you're the president of your company.  How does a president act like this?

309
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,510
To save the airplane fares, you get a free ride on someone else's bus?

310
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,280
I sent High Seven by airplane.

311
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,660
I treat them as fairly as the amount of money they make.

312
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,820
Yeah, you do.

313
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,180
If you don't sleep, play with me.

314
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,790
Don't bother me.

315
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:37,690
♫  I'm thinking of you every day  ♫

316
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,610
♫  You come to my mind  ♫

317
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,510
♫  Yesterday and today as well  ♫

318
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,420
♫  Pacing up and down toward where you are  ♫

319
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,930
♫  Going to you without realizing  ♫

320
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,500
♫  So surprised myself  ♫

321
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,200
♫  When did it go wrong  ♫

322
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Congratulations! 
♫  I don't know, my heart is pounding  ♫

323
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,370
I heard you got first place.  You tenaciously practiced...

324
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,830
♫  What's wrong with my heart  ♫

325
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,980
Thank you. 
 ♫  It keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

326
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,990
Did you do well on the stage?

327
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,900
It's already up on the internet.  Do you want to see it?

328
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,850
♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?  ♫

329
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,890
Is it you? 
♫  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

330
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,520
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop  ♫

331
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,410
♫  Whenever I look at you  ♫

332
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,960
Why do I sit with you?

333
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,580
That's what I'm saying.  You didn't even watch the competition.  Why did you follow us?

334
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,300
Only when it's convenient, you act like a chief director, don't you?

335
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,340
Ah, it's so crowded. Why do you tilt toward this side so much?

336
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,140
You're the one that needs to trim down your shoulder's size!

337
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,540
She must be very tired.

338
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,900
What's wrong?

339
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,920
Motion sickness.

340
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,680
Do you really?

341
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,560
Driver!  Let's take a brief break!

342
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,170
You may be getting a poison plant.

343
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,100
You're not a kid.

344
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,850
Are you satisfied if you touch everything with your hands or dip your feet into everything?

345
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,390
They are pretty.

346
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,520
If you want to touch a pretty one, touch me.  I'm pretty.

347
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,330
What are you thinking of? In broad daylight?

348
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,230
How sly.

349
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,630
Let's go.  They're going to leave now.

350
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:48,990
♫  It's weird,  I'm thinking of you too much,  it's more serious these days  ♫

351
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:56,980
♫  My face is flushed again, it's weird anyway  ♫

352
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:04,600
♫  It does it more than a dozen times a day,  I think I've gone crazy,  I think of you all day  ♫

353
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,500
♫  It's worse at night than during the day. Do you know how my heart feels?  ♫

354
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,700
♫   What should I do really?   ♫

355
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:19,500
♫  Thinking of you, thinking of you, my eyes are filled with you  ♫

356
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,300
♫  By any chance, I'm afraid you know how I feel  ♫

357
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,000
♫   So I'm pounding, thinking of you all day   ♫
