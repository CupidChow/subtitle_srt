00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,780
 Episode 12

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,730
Should I sue her?

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,420
No, I committed a grave sin.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,500

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,510
Hey, I was just about to call you but I hurt my arm. I'll explain everything.

6
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,750
Hey. Calm down. Okay?

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,770
C-Calm down.  Calm down please.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,570
Stop there!

9
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,190
Ah, really!  That's frightening!

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,740
Hey, this was super expensive!

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,170
I-I was just trying to help you. I didn't think there was even a 0.0000001% chance that you would like Joo Seo Yeon—

12
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,420
So, Joo Seo Yeon thought you and I were in that kind of relationship,

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,540
so she tried to help us out.  That's why she pretended to go out with me?

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,100
Without any feelings for me at all?

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,210
P-Probably...

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,550
Hey.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,370
A-Are you okay?

18
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,000
You're driving me crazy.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,350
I told her that you didn't know about this,

20
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,510
but she didn't believe me.

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,320
Don't ever say that. I planned this with you.

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,120
I was in it from the start, too.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,700
Why? I explained how you took no part in this—

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,860
Don't tell her!

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,200
The day Joo Seo Yeon finds out,

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,790
is the day I never see you again. Understand?

27
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,970
Did you understand?

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,600
Why did I come up with such a stupid lie?  What is this now?

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,280
My door...

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,790
Joo Seo Yeon. You dare to sympathize with me?

31
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,970
So you pretended to date me because of my poor situation?

32
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,990
 Yeah. To me, you're exactly as low as I see.

33
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,570
No. I'm worse than that.

34
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,980
I'm going to show you clearly,

35
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,740
how much worse I am.

36
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,290
Joo Seo Yeon.

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,670
So... You're saying Park Hyeon Soo and Lee Kang Woo came up with such a lie because they were afraid we'd suck their money?

38
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,180
This really reminded me that good-looking guys exploit their looks.

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,310
How well-off do they think they are?

40
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,800
This isn't an offense just to us, but to all the women and sexual minorities in Korea!

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,360
Should we post about this online?

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,850
Wait. Then the health teacher has no relation to this?

43
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,060
Right.  Because we just guessed he might be like them.

44
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,570
I knew my instinct was right. The health teacher really liked yo—

45
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,550
Hey! Hey! What the heck are you doing?

46
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,660
I can feel the anger just boiling inside of me, it's driving me crazy!

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,340
No, stop! They're crap! Just pretend you stepped in a pile of crap!

48
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,790
- They're crap! Crap! 
 - Let go!

49
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,860
All of you who are teachers look so down and your eyes are so dull.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
Thinking, "It's probably not me", you do everything with a half-assed effort.

51
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,700
Teacher Oh!  What are you doing right now?

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,990
Do you think I can't see you with your phone in your hands? I see everything!

53
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,620
Anyway, the midterms are literally right in front of us.

54
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,570
Aigoo, Chief Director!  What brings you here at this time?

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,040
I need an assistant.

56
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,930
Then we can hire an assistant.  Chief of School Affairs.

57
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,910
Why pick someone new?

58
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,690
- I think there is someone here with a lot of free time. 
 - Who?

59
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,570
Excuse me.  Students don't take a paper test in PE, right?

60
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,750
What do you think you're doing?

61
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,290
- What do you mean? I'm such a low person.  You know it well.  
 - What?

62
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,070
You were right. Pretending to be in a relationship with Park Hyeon Soo, and deciding to date you.

63
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,710
I did that to take revenge because of what happened in the past.

64
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,990
If I had plainly asked you out, you would've rejected me.

65
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,430
Of course. Why would I go out with you? It's not like I got shot in the head.

66
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:18,110
Exactly. That's why I lied. So what?

67
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,440
But I was caught faster than I had expected.

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,550
Since I already got caught, I just decided to push you around straight out.

69
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,130
- What? 
 - I saw that you're a contract teacher.

70
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,920
- You — 
 - You can drive, right?

71
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,480
- Have my tires checked and my oil changed. 
 - Hey!

72
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,540
You don't want to do it? If you don't want to, then never mind.

73
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,350
Then should I send out an announcement looking for a new PE teacher?

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,210
We are looking for a new PE teacher at the renowned Sinhwa High School.

75
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,270
Anyone who perfectly obeys orders from their boss can appl—

76
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,070
Fine.

77
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,820
You're speaking informally.

78
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,320
Sir. I understand, sir.

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,010
Tires and engine oil, sir.

80
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,040
Have it all done in an hour. I have to be driven somewhere.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,990
Driven? You want me to be your driver, too?

82
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,780
Alright. I should. I will. Sir!

83
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,540
Again?

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,980
Joo Seo Yeon, you really!

85
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,030
Why did you ask to meet outside?

86
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,890
I need to pretend I have a lot of things to do outside.

87
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,200
There weren't many people I could meet.

88
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,850
Over there. You see her?

89
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,790
Isn't she the lady from last time?

90
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,040
Is he talking badly about me right now?

91
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,050
He's a total gangster.

92
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,140
Then, regarding your emotions towards her...

93
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,680
The difference between that feeling and hatred was paper-thin.

94
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,020
I already ripped a thin paper off, lightly.

95
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,240
- Something tells me a lot of the papers are left. 
 - Sorry?

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,580
Excuse me. May I see your ear?

97
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,050
I was wondering if you had something lodged in your ear.

98
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,230
What's this? Waiting in the chief director's office without hesitation?

99
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,080
- What? 
 - Why are you so harsh on Teacher Joo?

100
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,990
You said you're from the same class. Aren't you friends?

101
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,060
- Mind your own business. 
 - Teacher Joo is a good teacher.

102
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,910
- Who cares? 
 - Hyung!

103
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,790
Hyung? I said you didn't want people to know we were cousins. What if someone heard you?

104
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,300
You should leave now, Health Teacher.

105
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,760
Isn't it weird if a health teacher and a chief director are friends?

106
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,840
Don't be concerned about whether I grill or boil Teacher Joo.

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,590
It is our problem, between us.

108
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,350
I'm sorry, I ate this without permission.

109
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,000
You're welcome any time.

110
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:31,410
Teacher, if someone does good deeds, shouldn't they be blessed?

111
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,520
Why are things still hard on me?

112
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,400
Are you okay?

113
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,570
What happened with Director Lee?

114
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,140
It's an ill-fated relationship–a piece of gum stuck in the hair.

115
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,730
It's stuck so hard so you can't take it out.

116
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,500
You have no choice but to cut your hair.

117
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,440
That kind of ill fate.

118
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,350
Thank you.

119
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,850
Yes, Grandma.

120
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,020
Your cousin is doing well at the school?

121
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,330
I wish he would be half as good as you are.

122
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,710
 Yes.  He's doing well.

123
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,490
You take good care of your cousin.  Let's get together some time.

124
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,660
Okay.

125
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,920
What's wrong with our Kang Woo so you always say that?

126
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,020
You should know how to see your own child objectively.

127
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,320
What is he good for, besides his good looks?

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,590
Does he have a good job or a good personality?

129
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,440
Min Hyeok was a doctor in the past.

130
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,280
He just works under Kang Woo right now.

131
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,990
Once a doctor, always a doctor.  What are you talking about?

132
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,100
If he decides, I'll set up a hospital for him right away.

133
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,030
That's a very good idea, Mother.

134
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,300
Min Hyeok was promising even when he was a kid.

135
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,670
He is kind, smart, and humble.

136
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,050
Kang Hee and Kang Woo are my children but they're too cocky.

137
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,200
You, really!

138
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,540
Look how time passed. Mother, let's get going. We'll be late.

139
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,830
Where are you going?

140
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,990
How can you be here?

141
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,520
You have a dinner appointment with Whole Foods from the UK. Are you ditching your appointment?

142
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,790
What's this about?

143
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,800
- You said you weren't busy for the company matters, Son? 
 - That's right.

144
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,630
Since you said you weren't busy, we were going to go to spa with you.

145
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,930
I was not busy.  That's why I was going—

146
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,210
Whatever.  It's not like that I'm a frontman.

147
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,870
You do all the work but why do I have to be there?  Why?

148
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,130
Look at her glare, Mother.  Fine, I'll go!  I'll go!

149
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,060
I'm going!

150
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,260
I told you you don't need you to drop us off.

151
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,190
It's on the way.  I'll send Driver Kim to pick you up when you're done.

152
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,090
Make sure you order saffron risotto at the restaurant.

153
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,030
That is very delicious.

154
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,620
I don't care.  Nothing tastes good during business dinners.

155
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,320
Mother-in-law, shall we go to the restaurant where my husband is going, later?

156
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,400
Where?

157
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,060
The restaurant where Kang Woo went on a blind date last time.

158
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,090
Did Kang Woo go on a blind date?

159
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,500
For some reason, he easily agreed to go on a blind date.

160
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,370
I don't know what he didn't like about, but anyway it didn't work out.

161
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,930
Still, what matters is that he agreed to do it.

162
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,950
Just leave Kang Woo alone.  I'm sure he has his own plans.

163
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,070
He's not just thoughtless.

164
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,350
What? Did you hear anything?

165
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,520
 You're arriving at your destination.

166
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,570
We've arrived.

167
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,660
How did you get this wrong?

168
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,950
It's either all or nothing for me.

169
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,330
Hello! You're home!

170
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,730
Hyung, you're leaving for work now?

171
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,670
Have some. You love sweet potatoes

172
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,700
Thanks.

173
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,420
It's very tasty, right?  Tutor Ho Dol's parents are farming sweet potatoes.

174
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,830
- Who? 
 - Our tutor.  You saw him last time.

175
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,320
Tutoring...

176
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,730
We're taking a break.  He went to bathroom.

177
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,070
You know me, right?

178
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,100
Sorry? N-No.

179
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,290
You don't?

180
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,420
- You don't remember?
- W-Well, I'm not sure...

181
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,650
So you were just curious that day.

182
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,380
No, I really mustered up my courage.

183
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,020
So you  do  remember.

184
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,710
- You— 
 -  I'll never tell anyone.

185
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,780
I'll never tell your family.

186
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,530
I'll never tell anyone and pretend knowing nothing.  So please don't fire me from tutoring.

187
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,840
- What?  
 - I...

188
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,110
I'm not the type of person who goes around telling secrets.

189
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,050
I'll absolutely keep it confidential.

190
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,100
We have never seen nor met at the bar.

191
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,960
Never.

192
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
What was he saying?

193
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,850
What secret to be kept?

194
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,900
What should I do to him?  Should I beat him until he's half-dead?

195
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,520
He's not even worth it.   I was stupid that I was deceived.

196
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,930
Anyway, it was fake dating, said you.  So you didn't get hurt much by it, right?

197
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,950
I guess so.

198
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,470
Stop worrying about me and go to work.

199
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,990
I'm going.

200
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,570

201
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,640

202
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,060
Why does she look so gloomy?

203
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,370
Is it because of that person?

204
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,760
You... I didn't like you from the start.

205
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,530
Yes, Ajumma.

206
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,190
 Where are you?  Your mom is here.

207
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,430
Hello, Mother.

208
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,280
He's 47 years old.

209
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,830
He divorced his 3rd wife 3 months ago, due to irreconcilable differences.

210
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,140
His assets are 30 billion won (~$26 million).

211
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,500
There's no time. Put the clothes on quickly and come out.

212
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,160
CEO Baek is notorious.  He has as many as fifteen  kids from mistresses.

213
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,250
Right?

214
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,370
All of them are step-siblings.  You're a child of the fifth mistress and you happen to be a daughter.

215
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,950
You should at least get married to a wealthy man and and benefit your family.  Don't you think so?

216
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,120
Your mom gave this card to me.  Do you want to go upstairs?

217
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,750
Who do you think you are?

218
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,840
When he asked, you should've followed him to go upstairs.

219
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,030
What good is saving your body?

220
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,830
You damned wench.  You useless wench.

221
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,780
Did she have an affair with your husband or something?

222
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,940
Who are you?  Don't mind someone else's business!  She is my daughter!

223
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,690
Then you're worse than what I thought!  How could you hit your own child?

224
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,980
You... I'll see you later.

225
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,590
She's quite small-boned. I'm pretty sure you could've subdued her.

226
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,380
You should've attacked her back.

227
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,700
I've been watching you from earlier, and I thought your feet would be hurting a lot.

228
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,920
Please wear this and go.

229
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,520
I bought this for 3,000 won at a stationery store so don't get burdened.

230
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,590
You paid dearly for being nosy. Haven't you learned a lesson yet?

231
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,950
But I feel like I've seen her before.

232
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,970
Really? I really don't know.

233
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,620
But, the girl who's normally here is gone, right?

234
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,040
Who?  A girl who has the most wicked name?

235
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,210
Was it Baek Jang Mi?

236
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,360
I guess she must've found somewhere to stay.

237
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,550
Then that's a relief.

238
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,340
Let's go.

239
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,480
Let's eat something delicious!

240
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,450
Good!  Wow!

241
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,080
I knew it.  People say that breakups are the driving force of hard work.  It's very good.

242
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,690
You're doing very well.  Good.

243
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,580
I'll leave.

244
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,950
What a temper!

245
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,740
By the way, why is Kim Mi Kyeong so quiet these days?  She is not the type of person who just lets it slide.

246
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,640
 Just give it to me. I'll change it to a different one next time.

247
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,960
 Don't touch my Potato without permission!

248
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,010
 What? You already gave it a name?

249
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:49,100
How is Potato?  He isn't mean to Potato because he hates me, right?

250
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,050
Why? Do you want one? Should I buy one for you?

251
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,480
Uh, no.

252
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,810
Have you contacted Park Hyeon Soo?

253
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,880
No. Why me?

254
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,960
It's best if we just ignore some jerks like him.  How can I interact with people who don't look like a human?

255
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,460
Let's go together!

256
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:29,350
♬  Meeting  by chance, a person who leaves me only sadness  ♬

257
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,230
♬  Becoming a small candle in my heart  ♬

258
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,870
♬  When I miss you, I close my eyes   ♬

259
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,020
♬  I want to shout to call you  ♬

260
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,690

261
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,660
♬  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♬

262
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,020
♬  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♬

263
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,210
 Even if it was a bet, I still felt so bad for saying such harsh words to you,

264
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,610
 so this time, I really wanted to help you.

265
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,360
 That was a lie, too?

266
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,400
 You really only see me as that low person?

267
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,380
 Yeah.  To me, you're exactly as low as I see.

268
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,670
♬  All this  ♬

269
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,690
No matter how much I changed, it didn't matter to you.

270
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,370
That's what you're saying.

271
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,920
Yes.

272
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Chief Director.  You're not coming to work today again?

273
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,760
No, well.

274
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,280
What should we do?  It's about the meal you mentioned the other day

275
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,420
that you were going to treat us to.  We scheduled it for today.

276
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,800
Do I have to be there?

277
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,790
Well, you were the one who suggested it in the first place.  If you don't come—

278
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,010
I got it.  Please send me the address.

279
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,060
He said he would buy a meal for us.   Did we ask him to buy a meal?

280
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,960
 Which tune on earth should I dance to?  Shaman song tune?

281
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,740
- Hello? 
 - Shaman song tune—  Oh, my!

282
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,720
Why didn't the phone hang up?

283
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,520
 Joo Seo Yeon would probably come.

284
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,100
Don't cause trouble without me.

285
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,120
If you can't stop yourself from killing Lee Kang Woo after trying to hold back, call me right away.

286
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,450
I know a good place to bury a corpse.

287
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,790
Come on.

288
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,080
Why do we have to have a meal gathering today?

289
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,040
Should I just not go to my parent's house?

290
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,500
Does it make sense that the daughter wouldn't be there for her father's memorial service?

291
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,400
Don't worry.  Give my regards to your mom.

292
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,970
Anyway, she is very thankful to you,

293
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,720
for sending her very expensive meat.

294
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,740
He used to like meat.  Serve a lot of meat for the memorial service.

295
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,560
I'm going.

296
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,400
Why can't I be at ease?  I feel like she'll get drunk and get in trouble today.

297
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,500
Should I get someone to look out for her, instead of me?

298
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,140
Health Teacher!

299
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,510
You're going to drive for me after the meal, so don't drink.

300
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,910
You'd rather call a substitute driver!

301
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,190
That's my choice.

302
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,470
Have drinks!

303
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,930
Drink up!

304
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,150
- Have a wrap. 
 - Thank you.

305
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,090
Drink up!

306
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,580
 What?

307
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,620
Teacher, would you like to have a drink?

308
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,170
Today isn't...

309
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,130
Please give it to me. I'll pour you a glass.

310
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,490
I came here with a car.

311
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,280
You're really a nice man, Health Teacher.

312
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,750
What a waste of drink.

313
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:08,120
♬  I see trees of green, red roses too  ♬

314
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,620
What's the matter?

315
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,070
It's sweet.

316
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,360
♬  For me and you  ♬

317
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,860
♬  And I think to myself  ♬

318
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,020
♬  What a wonderful world  ♬

319
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:35,360
♬  I see skies of blue and clouds of white  ♬

320
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,430
♬  The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  ♬

321
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,660
You're pretty.

322
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,750
What's your name?

323
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,290
I'm Joo Seo Yeon.

324
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,210
I told you not to drink.

325
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,610
It's my choice, bastard. What are you going to do about it?

326
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,210
- Go away! 
 - What are you doing? It's dirty!

327
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,490
That's why you shouldn't loiter in front of me.

328
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,850
- Go. Go! 
 - Hey! Hey, hey!

329
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,230
Are you a kid?  You're playing with dirt.

330
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,340
You're so mean.

331
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,640
Okay. Go home now.

332
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,980
People don't change easily.

333
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,750
I thought you changed, but you haven't changed at all.

334
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,710
Are your eyes messed up? You don't know just by seeing?

335
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,120
I've completely changed!

336
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,500
No. Then and now, you're still a bad guy.

337
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,600
You just lied to play with people's hearts.

338
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,980
Hey, what happened fifteen years ago—

339
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,240
How could a person stay the exactly same?

340
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,020
I changed. I'm telling you I changed!

341
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,540
Do you know how hard I worked to change?

342
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,030
Right, you changed.  A 180-degree change was not enough, so you've changed 360 degrees.

343
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,430
Right I've changed 360—

344
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,680
That's the original spot!

345
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,050
You... in the past and now, you're the exact same guy.

346
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,030
I don't like any part of you.  Not even one part!

347
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,050
Not even one part.

348
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,720
You are really an unchanging punk.

349
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,970
An unchanging punk.

350
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,350
What should I do, then?

351
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,500
What?

352
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,810
What should I do in order to make you like me?

353
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,260
Lee Kang Woo, you!

354
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,620
 What on earth should I do in order to make you like me?

355
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,940
- What is this with you? 
 - I'll bring her home.

356
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,890
What are you doing right now?

357
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,510
You're the one who bullied her.  What are you trying to do?

358
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,590
You don't know why she got so drunk?

359
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,050
I told you it's none of your business.

360
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,890
Yes. I'll make it my business.

361
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,190
What are you? Who exactly are you?

362
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,640
By any chance, Joo Seo Yeon...

363
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,350
Ask it.

364
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,690
You know I can't lie.

365
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,800
Ask me why I'm being like this.

366
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:41,590

367
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,950
 Love With Flaws

368
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,340
 Pull yourself together very hard!

369
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,970
 It looks like potential of dating will explode.

370
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,710
 Is Min Hyeok dating someone?  It looks like their vibe is very serious.

371
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,820
 I fell for her at first sight, then I gradually began to like her.

372
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,610
 You never smiled at me like that.

373
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,150
 I'll be a nuisance.  I'll get on your nerves.

374
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,960
 Ah, it's really slovenly.

375
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,640
 But who would be in unrequited love?

376
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,140
 I can't ever like someone who looks like you.

377
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,400
 I'm sorry that I like you.

378
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,400
♫  But did you get tired of me or did I do something wrong?  ♫
