00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,800
 Episode 28

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,530
What are you doing over there?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,900
What is a human being really?  If I think that way, I feel sad.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,970
What?

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,050
I'm talking about Teacher Lee Min Hyeok.  If you look at him carefully, he has cow eyes,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,600
very sad cow eyes.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,380
There is no possibility at all for you to date Teacher Lee Min Hyeok, right?

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,910
Hey!

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,300
I know, I know.  But I was just asking in case.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,080
There is no "in case".  I'm definitely for Lee Kang Woo.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,110
It's a shame, what a shame.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,730

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,480
Right now... I'm avoiding Joo Seo Yeon, right?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,700
- Hyung! You're here. 
 - Yeah.

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,890
Are you okay?

16
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,320
Why wouldn't I be?

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,660
Huh? I just thought you were sick because you haven't been coming out.

18
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:37,570
Joo Seo Joon. I'm so jealous of you for getting favoritism even when you do nothing.

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,760
- I'm sorry? 
 - But...

20
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,350
A person can't only have good days.

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,040
Enjoy it while you can.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,260
What the—

23
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,690
Isn't this yours?

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,340
 The door is closing.

25
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,770
That seemed like a picture of Joo Seo Joon.

26
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,540
Hi.

27
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,310
Kang Woo.

28
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,430
Don't call me like that.

29
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,670
Why are you lying?

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,130
Even no matter how mean I am to you,

31
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,070
as long as I call you "Kang Woo," you would forgive me for everything.

32
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,860
Do you not like me anymore?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,810
You're disgusted by me?

34
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,990
Do you really hate me?

35
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,120
- Want to go inside? 
 - Yeah.

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,050
If you go in now, I'm not going to send you home today.

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,030
What?

38
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,710
I'm not going to send you home.

39
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,100
Do you still want to go in?

40
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,640
Look...

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,600
Don't provoke me.

42
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,240
You know I'm the one that can't hate you.  So don't test me.

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,800
It's annoying.

44
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,990
Who is this?

45
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,410
 Lee Kang Woo. It's Lee Kang Woo.

46
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,240
How do you know my number?

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,190
Did Seo Yeon get home safely?

48
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,060
What kind of random— Why are you asking that out of the blue?

49
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,690
I couldn't take her home.

50
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,650
Yeah, she's home.

51
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,450
That's a relief.

52
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,440
But, I don't think we're close enough to be calling each other like this.

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,030
I'm sorry and thank you.

54
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,390
But how does this guy know my phone number?

55
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,990
My personal information is way too public.

56
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,170
Did she drop everything?

57
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,560
What are you doing?

58
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,980
I'm sorry, but the only person I could think of was you.

59
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,370
What's wrong?

60
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,180
What should I do? I feel so bad for my father.

61
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,170
I think my dad saw the video.

62
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm not ready yet—

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,870
I'm not ready to tell him just yet.

64
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,070
Stop crying.

65
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,700
Okay.

66
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,710
I said stop—

67
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,700
Don't hit me, I'll stop crying!

68
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,740
I thought you were going to hit me.

69
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,850
What?

70
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,760
Sorry.

71
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,800
You asked me how I told my family about it, right?

72
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,410
I didn't know either, that I was going through a hard time.

73
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,480
 No! Won Seok!

74
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,480
 The Rocky Mountains stretch from Canada to New Mexico in the United States, from north to south...

75
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,090
 Won Seok.

76
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,590
 Answer me, punk.

77
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,990
 Yes.

78
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,690
 Did it hurt?

79
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,690
 Why do you have no fear?

80
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,960
 I'm sorry.

81
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
 Of course you should be sorry.

82
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,180
 Waters flow either to the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans.

83
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,300
 I wish he would be a less quiet person.

84
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:49,560
 Someday, when are you going to introduce the guy you're meeting to me?

85
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,820
 I'm sorry.

86
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,540
 Won Seok. That

87
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,150
 isn't something you should be sorry for.

88
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,310
No matter how you tell your father,

89
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,180
yours would be better than

90
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,230
what I did, letting my father see my worst moment with his own eyes.

91
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,650
So let's give it a shot.

92
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,380
 Why...

93
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,200
 did you deceive me?

94
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,730
I'm sorry?

95
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,690
If you have nothing to say today...

96
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,320
No. I don't.

97
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,050
A man like me can't dare to talk about her

98
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,110
this time.

99
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,640
Do you have scissors?

100
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,010
Pardon?  W-Why do you need scissors?

101
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,860
There is a thread on my clothes.

102
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,950
Give it to me.   I'll do it.

103
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,280
Wait a moment.  I'll do it.

104
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,430
I'll do it for you.

105
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,660
Pardon?  Well, yes.

106
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,050
 Dr Kim Dong Gu

107
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes?

108
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,690
Did you leave something?

109
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,930
Are you a ghost?

110
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,230
R-Real?

111
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,560
Are you me?

112
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,440
♬  Pretty woman, walking down the street  ♬

113
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,940
Wonderful things.

114
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,920
You really blossomed beautifully.

115
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,660
♬  I don't believe you, you're not the truth  ♬

116
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,020
♬  No one can look as good as you  ♬

117
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,660
- Grandma, are you okay? 
 - Huh?

118
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,520
Are you dizzy? Are you hurt anywhere?

119
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,760
Ah,  no...

120
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,680
Get on my back.

121
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,310
Aigoo, what's happening?

122
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,280
Excuse me.  That's...

123
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,390
Grandmother, where are you?

124
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,760
You already arrived? Where—

125
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,120
Health Teacher!

126
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,750
- Emergency!  Emergency! 
 - Pardon?

127
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,620
Hurry, hurry!

128
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,540
Hurry up!

129
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,870
Grandma, are you hurt anywhere?

130
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,780
No.

131
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,270
This grandma fell down.

132
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,190
Excuse me, Teacher Joo. This person here is—

133
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,170
Health Teacher, I ask this of you.

134
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,930
What?

135
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,460
Okay. Don't worry and go. It's class time.

136
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,280
Ah!  I forgot!

137
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,940
Grandma, this teacher is very good.

138
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,260
If you're hurting anywhere, please talk to him about it.

139
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,000
Okay, I will.

140
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,470
You should go now.

141
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,070
Okay!

142
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,300
- Is your leg okay? 
 - It's her, right?

143
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,120
The woman that Kang Woo's dating.

144
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,350
Do you know as well, Grandmother?

145
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,220
Whether the school runs well,

146
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,370
shall we look around?

147
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,600
It seems like you're doing very well.

148
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,250
Still, don't think you should continue working here.

149
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,580
It's fun, working at school.

150
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,020
You can't go back to being a doctor no matter what?

151
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,410
Your wounded heart from that incident hasn't healed yet?

152
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,480
Did you think that I didn't know why you left the hospital?

153
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,710
After you quit the hospital, the hospital director told me about it.

154
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,010
I thought that things would get better as time passed.

155
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,580
I'm sorry.

156
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,040
To me, Kang Woo and you are my equal grandsons.

157
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,550
You should show everything in your heart like your older cousin in order for me to understand you.

158
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:14,620
How do you carry an old man in your heart?

159
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,070
My poor grandson.

160
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,730
 Doctor.

161
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,720
 Please one word.  Please just say one word.

162
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,620
 Please say just one word.

163
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,490
 Please say just one word.

164
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,660
 Please, Doctor.  Please say just one word.

165
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,630
Teacher.

166
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,950
Are you okay?

167
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,250
Are you not going home?

168
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,550
Your eyes are red, so I thought maybe you have a fever.

169
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,290
Did that grandma leave well?

170
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,100
Yes.

171
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,660
I'm sorry. You must've been busy.

172
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,960
Anyway, I'm too nosy to handle.

173
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,570
That hurts, please stop.

174
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,280
You should go home, Teacher Joo. I still have things to do, so.

175
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,060
 You should show everything in your heart like your older cousin in order for me to understand you.

176
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,460
Should I just tell her everything?

177
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,160
 Sinhwa Food

178
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,650
Wait ... What are you saying?

179
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,380
You're saying that Min Hyeok also likes that girl?

180
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,450
So the way that he looks at that girl isn't normal.

181
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,590
What the heck's the situation?

182
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,160
I know ... I don't know what to do. If his mother finds out...

183
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,380
No, Mother! She shouldn't know!

184
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,170
If she knows, there will be big trouble.

185
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,130
Kang Woo, Min Hyeok, that girl...they'll all be in big trouble!

186
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,310
That's exactly why I'm worried, exactly why.

187
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,780
She probably won't come today, right?

188
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,200
Well, I did scare her a lot.

189
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,110
She was just there!

190
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,250
What am I doing, seriously?

191
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,450
What on earth am I doing?

192
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,290
What's so scary?

193
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,200
 - Would you like to come in?
- Yeah.

194
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,350
 But if you come in now, I'm not going to let you go today.

195
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,070
 I said I wouldn't send you home.

196
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,280
I just got here.

197
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,910
I'll wait on the first floor.

198
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,480
This place is more expensive and much more delicious!

199
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,440
I got it.  Come quickly!

200
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,600
Wow, Look at his physique.

201
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,090
Hello. If you have any thoughts about modeling—

202
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,420
 Wow! Is that her boyfriend? He's so handsome!

203
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,460
Car dealership, right? Joo Seo Yeon?

204
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,960
- Joo Seo Yeon? 
 - Oh, Oppa!

205
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,010
Oppa? How do you know this person?

206
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,220
He's Seo Yeon's older brother.

207
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,270
Joo Seo Yeon's older brother!

208
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,770
They don't look alike in the slightest.

209
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,380
Oh just let it slide, Oppa. He has really bad eyes.

210
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,060
What are you talking about, my eyes are really good—

211
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,860
Who are you?

212
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,570
I'm Kim Mi Kyeong's boyfriend.

213
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,730
Oppa, we'll leave first.

214
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,330
I'm serious! They don't look alike at all.

215
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,980
Kim Mi Kyeong, where did she meet that jerk?

216
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,140
Who?

217
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,920
Seo Yeon's friend. My younger sister's.

218
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,720
You have a younger sister?

219
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,690
Huh? I have three younger siblings.

220
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,160
I thought you knew all of my personal information.

221
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,160
I don't know anything about your family.  I see, you have three younger siblings.

222
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,480
I don't have a single peaceful day because of them.

223
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,650
When I also think of my younger brother, the first that comes out is a sigh.

224
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,780
- You're going to go home, right? 
 -  I'm going to go to the office.

225
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,460
I still have work left.

226
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,460
Then you should've rescheduled for another time! You must be tired.

227
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,790
I'm recharging by seeing you.

228
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,480
Seriously...

229
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,750
You like me so much!

230
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,720
Let's go together!

231
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,800
That scared me. You didn't go home?

232
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,040
You!  I told you to watch Kang Woo. But why didn't you do that?  You just put it in the drawer.

233
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,520
- You're so bad!  
 - What?

234
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,700
Everything is ruined. It's ruined, ruined. Move out of the way.

235
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,860
It's ruined. It's ruined, it's ruined!

236
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,420
 Joo Seo Yeon

237
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,420
 Address:  1120 Hyeonnam Blvd. Mapo-gu, Seoul

238
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,100
Why is there Joo Won Jae's address?

239
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,120
 Brother: Joo Won Jae, Brother: Joo Won Seok, Brother: Joo Seo Joon

240
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,550
 From what family?

241
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,410
 The only daughter of the Joo family?

242
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,780
 Your younger brother and Seo Yeon don't match.

243
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,810
 Seo Yeon, let's play!

244
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,820
 This is an interesting place.

245
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,930
 Who?

246
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,080
 Seo Yeon's friend. My younger sister's.

247
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,380
This dog-like situation...

248
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,900
 Don't provoke me.

249
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,800
 You know I can't stop liking you. So don't test me.

250
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,410
 I'll stay like this.

251
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,880
 So that you can't see my face.

252
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,540
 Let me stay like this.

253
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,540
 You don't have to look if you don't want to. Just stay as you are.

254
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,160
 I'll make sure you don't see me.

255
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,300
 Here, stamp.

256
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,260
 I'm sorry for liking you.

257
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,300
 - Would you like to come in? 
 - Yeah.

258
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,810
 But if you come in now, I'm not going to let you go today. I said I wouldn't send you home.

259
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,200
 Would you still like to come in?

260
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,980
- Teacher! 
 - Huh?

261
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,290
Are you going somewhere?

262
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,190
Oh, just somewhere, yeah.

263
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,420
Would you like to eat this with us?

264
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,050
No. L-Later.

265
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,440
Eat first, eat first, hm?

266
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,270
That little jerk, why is he doing that in the living room when he has his own room?

267
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,990
What's this?

268
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,640
- ♫ Bye, bye ♫ 
 - Oh my.

269
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,180
♫ Seoul ♫

270
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,230
♫ Goodbye ♫

271
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,380
Did something pass?

272
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:45,600
♫  It's weird,  I'm thinking of you too much, it's more serious these days  ♫

273
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,490
♫  My face is flushed again, it's weird anyway  ♫

274
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,650
♫  It does it more than a dozen times a day,  I think I've gone crazy.   ♫

275
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,340
♫  I think of you all day  ♫

276
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,810
♫  It's worse at night than during the day–do you know how my heart feels?  ♫

277
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,690
♫  What should I do really?  ♫

278
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,250
♫  Thinking of you, thinking of you    ♫

279
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,140
♫  My eyes are filled with you  ♫

280
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,910
♫  By any chance, I'm afraid you know how I feel  ♫

281
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,730
♫  So I'm pounding, thinking of you all day   ♫

282
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,850
Do you know what time it is right now?

283
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,170
Are my words a joke to you?

284
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,080
I won't go.

285
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,360
I won't go home.

286
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,650
I'll stay with you.

287
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,490
What?

288
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,270
Let's stay together, Kang Woo.

289
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,860
Joo Seo Yeon...

290
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,030
I don't know either.

291
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,730

292
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,620
 Love With Flaws

293
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,280
 Where did Noona go?

294
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,620
 Crazy! What do you mean I can't handle it?

295
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,230
 I'm spending the night with someone I love! So what?

296
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,890
 This is a mess. I'm saying that from your head to your toes, they're all problems.

297
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,450
 Your eyes are very murky.

298
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,600
 This is the first time I've ever seen that he says I am his girlfriend with his own mouth.

299
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,820
 - Who is it? 
 - She'll be here soon.

300
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,010
 Do you want to get married?

301
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,120
 What more will you do for me?  You've already done so much.

302
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,010
 I want to do to you.

303
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,670
 You saw the pictures, right? Does your company know too?

304
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,580
 Tell Joo Seo Joon to come up.

305
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,990
 The thing that worries me most is that she goes around looking like you.

306
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,420
 Why are you constantly worried about me? You're giving me butterflies.

307
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,630
 If your heart wants to do something, then you should do it.

308
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,790
 Even if you withstand it, Lee Kang Woo won't be able to!

309
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,510
 Joo Seo Yoon, do you think things like that matter to me?

310
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,700
♫  Take responsibility for my life that was ruined like that  ♫
