00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,500
 Episode 31

2
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,810

3
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,940
Are you awake?

4
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,160
Are you alright?

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,240
You're leaving already? Why?

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,820
My brothers are still sleeping right now. I have to go before they wake up.

7
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,210
Don't go, Joo Seo Yeon. Don't go.

8
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,680
Don't do this, Lee Kang Woo. I have to go.

9
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
Play with me.

10
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,980
Why are you two together this morning?

11
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,310
Then why are you coming home in the morning?

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,550
You're caught! Let's have Bibimbap later.

13
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,830
Good times.

14
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,110
I'm going to change my clothes.

15
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,540
Go ahead.  When did I ever step out when you're changing?

16
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,900
What is this? You didn't wear this?

17
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,860
What? No.

18
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,920
Wow. Lee Kang Woo is  really  in love.

19
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,330
It's true love! True love!

20
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,460
Be quiet. My brothers will hear.

21
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Love!

22
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,250
You really!

23
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,820
 I don't see anything but you right now.

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,750
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

25
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,860
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

26
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,550
♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

27
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,090
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop whenever I look at you  ♫

28
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,690
♫  What’s wrong with me? Since when?  ♫

29
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,880
Don't be fooled.

30
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,370
You're being fooled by

31
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,540
the trick of the hormones like Oxytocin or Dopamine.

32
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,290
A situation that's been packaged in the name of love.

33
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,750
Dr. Kim.

34
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,490
- Do you know me?
 - Excuse me?

35
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,590
The person you're addressing as "Hyungnim,"

36
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,000
don't worry about me. I stepped out just to get some air.

37
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,690
What was that?

38
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,260
Joo Won Seok, if you're awake, come on out. Let's eat.

39
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,330
Do you want to eat this?

40
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,710
Huh? Yeah, I should eat.

41
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,600
Something is strange about you.

42
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,890
Me? What about? I don't think so.

43
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,950
Hyung. Noona. Help me.

44
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,130
Teacher, I'm sorry.

45
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,070
I...

46
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,650
am in trouble

47
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,250
What are you two...

48
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,390
You— You, punk!

49
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,910
Joo Won Seok, if you're awake, get out here now.

50
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,690
You better speak truthfully. Oppa!

51
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,510
Because of Lee Joo Hee, I got canned from my agency.

52
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,420
Hey, that's a cheap shot. It was because of your misunderstanding.

53
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,490
You made it so that it ended up a misunderstanding.

54
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,110
What? What the—

55
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,120
What, what!

56
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,500
So, she is a student you brought home, Joo Seo Yeon?

57
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,890
Yes, I think I need to clear any misunderstanding.

58
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,030
I'm sorry. I was told your company was put in a spot because of him.

59
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,270
Well, Joo Seo Joon was not in a position that would make the company damaged.

60
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,850
Then what kind of situation was this?

61
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,570
She was working part-time as an internet shopping mall model, but he thought it was something else.

62
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,100
She was wearing clothes and makeup that she normally doesn't wear,

63
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,280
so he tried to stop her.

64
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,970
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,540
You have a better character than I thought.

66
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,650
I thought you would remain in the company anyhow after you would blame everything on her.

67
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,490
I'm a bit cool.

68
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,640
Shut it. Shut it.

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,650
It's good. I really like it.

70
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,410
You have to have high self-esteem if you want to remain in this industry.

71
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,440
You can't survive here if you're having a meltdown with one bad comment.

72
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,400
Did you call for me, Sir?

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,970
- Hyung. 
 - Oh, Han Jeong Oh.

74
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,200
Why did you do it?

75
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,100
Pardon?

76
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,170
You posted this picture.

77
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,650
You should've done it properly if you had wanted to do it. Instead, you had a witness.

78
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,710
 Door is closing.

79
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,470
 It looked like a picture of Joo Seo Joon.

80
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,520
Anyway, go elsewhere and do your best.

81
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,660
S-Sir.

82
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,690
What?  Do you think you would pay too much for just one momentary mistake?

83
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,890
May I tell you something that makes you more upset?

84
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:11,570
You were selected as a member of High Seven's brother debut team, as the first priority.

85
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,730
But no matter how talented you are, if your character is the pits, it won't work out at  my  company.

86
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,710
So...

87
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,580
Leave.

88
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,950
 HS Entertainment

89
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,690
Hyung!

90
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,300
That night, I went there to see you. Do you know?

91
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,670
I went there because I was worried about you!

92
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,190
So what?!

93
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,310
I'll no longer worry about you since I now know how cruel you are.

94
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,680
So be as cruel as you can be and see you on stage.

95
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,530
Not as trainees, but let us meet and compete on stage.

96
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,180
CEO said he wouldn't tell anybody why you quit.

97
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,930
So a lot of other companies must want you to come to their companies because of your talent.

98
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,100
Are you sympathizing with me right now?

99
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,150
I am, why? Is that bad?

100
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,550
Challenge me, then I'm going to crush you.

101
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,080
I'll raise your younger brother well. If it goes well, he'll become like Park Seok Min.

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,170
What?

103
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,110
You... You really are CEO.

104
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,870
You're quite... cool.

105
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm cool?

106
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,300
You should convey my coolness to Kim Mi Kyeong.

107
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,370
Don't hurt Mi Kyeong.

108
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,900
If there's a tear in Mi Kyeong's eyes...

109
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,460
I'll kill you.

110
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,460
I'm going.

111
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,780
It looks like she means it with what she says.

112
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,070
I'm not sure if Lee Kang Woo, who is a scaredy-cat, doesn't get scared by her.

113
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,180
Are you working on your day off?  It seems you have no one to play with.

114
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,700
Are you working on your day off?  It seems you have no one to play with!

115
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,470
On your day off—

116
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,190
- Stop it! 
 - Even though you heard it, why did you pretend not to hear it?

117
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,220
There was no way I didn't hear you.  I just ignored you.

118
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,780
Why do you ignore me? Why do you ignore me when your hyung was talking?

119
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,770
Are you here to pick a fight?

120
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,130
Yes!  Is there a rule that only you can pick a fight?

121
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,730
- What? 
 - Is there only what's on your mind?  I have things on my mind as well.

122
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,750
Geez.  Really.

123
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,260
I heard it from Grandmother.

124
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,740
How nosy you are.

125
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,900
Should I take back what I told Grandmother?

126
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,670
No!

127
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,370
Are you busy?

128
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,490
If you see it, you don't get it?

129
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,310
Well... Do you want... to eat a meal with me?

130
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,280
What are you doing?  You asked me to eat a meal with you.

131
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,850
Right!  Let's eat!

132
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,020
Is this a meal?

133
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,430
Yes.  Why?

134
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,760
Are you regularly getting a check-up?

135
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,440
It's a good thing that I brought this.

136
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,100
Here. It's a blood glucose meter.

137
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,000
Morning and evening, with a drop of blood—

138
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,150
Hey! I put my effort into buying this and bringing it here for your sake—

139
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,160
Who would the butt hole worry about?

140
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,060
What?

141
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,150
I heard it from Hyung Hyeon Soo.

142
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,650
You were Butt Hole.  It was a good thing I didn't play with you.

143
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,440
If I had stayed next to Butt Hole, I would've been a butt hole as well, you Hyung Butt Hole.

144
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,600
Why are you so mean?  Are you always mean like that?

145
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,950
- Eat it. 
 - No, I won't eat it.

146
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,570
Then don't eat.

147
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm going to eat.

148
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,270
You're so bad.

149
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,920
I got it.  I'll eat fewer sweets.

150
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,800
Don't touch it.

151
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,220
- Yes. Where are you? 
 - I arrived here.

152
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,240
Ah, Hyung-nim.  I see you.  Here, here.

153
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,040
Hyung-nim.

154
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,010
What are you doing?

155
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,010
Ah, the owner said it was very urgent to go to the bathroom so—

156
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,460
You're watching this for him?  He is your acquaintance?

157
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,990
No.  He just really looked so urgent. By the way, I couldn't sell even one.

158
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,030
I want to sell at least one.

159
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,720
How much?

160
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,010
No, you don't need to buy it.

161
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,290
- I'm asking how much. 
 - No, it's fine.

162
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,400
Ah, really.  Why am I like this?

163
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,330
I always only cause a nuisance to you.

164
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,570
This is not you.

165
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,290
My father's picture at a young age.  I always carry it habitually.

166
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,440
He really looked cool.

167
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,310
He resembles you very much.

168
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,660
Well, is it so?

169
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,260
Thank you.

170
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,100
For making Hyung-nim live so nicely like this.

171
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,380
Is this the one?

172
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,760
 Your phone isn't connected so it goes to the voice mail...

173
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,470
Is she busy?

174
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,590
What brings you here?  Are you here to buy a car?

175
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,790
No.  Hyung-nim Won Seok asked me to bring something to you.

176
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,910
This.

177
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,220
Wait a moment.

178
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,120
Excuse me.  May I ask what this picture is?

179
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,060
The place he designated to die.

180
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,030
Pardon?

181
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,360
When he saw this place on TV a long time ago, he said inadvertently,

182
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,930
that it won't be bad if he dies at the place like that.

183
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,500
And a little later, he brought this picture.

184
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,660
Bad punk.  He knew very well that I knew it.

185
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,850
I really wanted to rip this off a while ago but I thought he might endure one day at a time by looking at this.

186
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,890
And I was also scared.

187
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,140
Then Hyung-nim Won Seok is still having a very hard time—

188
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,290
Don't worry.

189
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,230
It looks like he sent you to me on purpose in order to let me know that kind of incident wouldn't happen from now on.

190
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,260
 I received the picture well.  Is it because of him?

191
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,120
 He said, "Thank you for my living on."

192
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,570
 Sinhwa Food

193
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,590
Lee Kang Hee!

194
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,730
How did you get in?

195
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,470
Your secretary recognizes me.

196
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,010
Why didn't you answer my calls?

197
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,830
Don't you see that I'm working?

198
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,490
I'm not a person who has time to be able to answer all your calls.

199
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,090
W-What happened?

200
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,850
Are you mad at me?

201
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,220
You should've rejected me.

202
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,690
Joo Won Jae, you were really after my background?

203
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,150
That was why you grabbed so easily—

204
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,550
- Pardon? 
 - Why do you act all innocent all of a sudden?

205
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,680
Do you think I'm a person who can marry just anybody?  I just said it jokingly.

206
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,230
- Lee Kang Hee. 
 - You're less fun than I expected.

207
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,170
Let's stop it.

208
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,610
I told you we should stop it.

209
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,930
You're lying right now, Lee Kang Hee.

210
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,580
What makes you believe that?

211
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,970
Your eyes that looked at me were the same as my eyes that looked at you—until now.

212
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,470
I clearly warned you when I stopped you from coming to me, didn't I?

213
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,300
I would hold on to you if you left me.

214
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,240
I don't know why you suddenly act like this but I'll hold on to you.

215
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,490
So you'd better get grabbed by me.

216
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,630
If it's not today, then tomorrow.

217
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,060
If it's not tomorrow, then another day.

218
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,040
I'll just leave for today.

219
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,830
I missed you.

220
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,420
We saw each other this morning.

221
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,330
This...

222
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,350
Please save them.  I think I have a black thumb.

223
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,490
What?

224
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,100
What did Hyung-nims say?

225
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,840
- About what? 
 - You and me.

226
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,940
- What about you and me? 
 - About dating.

227
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,050
What?

228
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,390
You didn't tell them about it by chance?

229
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,780
I think they noticed approximately. Do we have to?

230
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,520
I want to be approved officially.

231
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,350
We don't have to go that far already.

232
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,840
Already?  What do you mean already?  Why are you like that?

233
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,260
About what?

234
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:35,280
Why do I feel you're stepping back?  I'm getting insecure.

235
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,270
I'm embarrassed.

236
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,080
Am I embarrassing?

237
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,260
No, that's not it.

238
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:54,700
I don't know.  Just saying I'm dating someone is a little...

239
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,690
- Let's go! 
 - Huh?

240
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,470
I was short-sighted. It would have been much simpler if I had just told them.

241
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,900
Wait a sec, I'll be right back after I change clothes.

242
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,840
- It doesn't really have to be today! 
 - Today is the day.

243
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,230
Gosh. I'm really embarrassed.

244
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,290
- The second oldest bro says he'll be late. 
 - Huh?

245
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,340
Then maybe—next time.

246
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,010
- Did you come to ask permission to get married? 
 - Were you thinking of permitting—

247
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,980
No, not at all. We were just...

248
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,060
We are seeing each other.

249
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,780
No kidding. If you weren't dating after all that fuss, would it make sense?

250
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,610
- Just what are you doing for your living, Ahjussi? 
 - I said I'm not an ahjussi—

251
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,510
I'm in the textile business.

252
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,190
Clothing? Going from my school chief director to the textile industry is somewhat odd...

253
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,130
A Chief Director?

254
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,730
This ahjussi was our school chief director, for an extremely short period.

255
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,430
I guess he isn't all that capable.

256
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,310
Hey, Joo Seo Joon!

257
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,610
Wait, if it's your school... is it Sinhwa High School?

258
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,920
I don't think just some "nobody" could be a chief director there.

259
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,530
He's the grandson of Sinhwa Group owner.

260
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,770
Mr. Lee Kang Woo is the grandson of Sinhwa Group's owner. Did you not know?

261
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,440
Hey Ahjussi, are you a chaebol?

262
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,480
I mean, not me personally, per se, but my family is a bit...

263
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,770
You— You—

264
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,560
You!

265
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,580
Director Lee.

266
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,330
Yes, Sir.

267
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,400
Your mom and grandma would like to officially meet with Kang Woo's lady.

268
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,620
In what capacity?

269
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,120
Well not to oppose them but to get lightly acquainted.

270
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,960
Get acquainted? What's the rush?

271
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,160
Isn't it because of you, punk?

272
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,850
Do you have any idea how unsettled your mom's feeling that Kang Woo might not be interested in a committed relationship, like you?

273
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,530
Here.

274
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,750
Dad.

275
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:35,800
I thought I was a really smart person, but I'm really dumb.

276
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,020
I thought I was really mean, but I'm really nice.

277
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,210
Just like an idiot.

278
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,250
Director Lee! Kang Hee!

279
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,920
Kang...

280
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,660
Wait a minute. Is something the matter with that child?

281
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,030
Why on earth are they letting just anybody in my office?

282
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,740
Secretary Kim! Secretary Kim!

283
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,930
Dang, how instantaneously I become "just anybody."

284
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,390
You've known all along, haven't you?

285
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,520
My younger sister and your younger brother. You did it while knowing about it, didn't you?

286
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,760
- What crazy situ— 
 - Freakin' situation is there, no?

287
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,510
Should we just do the deed and see?

288
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,690
If you cast the net, I'll willingly be caught in it.

289
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,900
I'm sorry.

290
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,450
I'm glad

291
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,050
that you are not a selfish person.

292
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,370
I'm really sorry.

293
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,680
I can endure it, but my little brother, Kang Woo, can't.

294
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,380
Joo Won Jae.

295
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:21,670
I think I like you much more than...

296
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,730
I know.

297
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,760
I do know.

298
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,230
Then that's enough.
