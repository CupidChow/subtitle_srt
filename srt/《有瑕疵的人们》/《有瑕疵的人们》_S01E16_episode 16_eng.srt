00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,660
 Episode 16

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,730
Hey.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,340
Why don't you come to school nowadays?

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm busy.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,400
Why? Is someone looking for me?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,440
No, not really.

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,930
What are you two doing?

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,530
You're here.  Mother, can you taste my food I just cooked?

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,440
Okay, let me taste.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,480
Just wait for a little.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,550
Don't just stand blankly over here but help setting the table.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,700
- Okay. 
- Okay!

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,520
I think Min Hyeok has a girlfriend.  Try to sound him out about it.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Why should I?

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,240
His mother and father don't concern him at all.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,880
So I, as his aunt, should meddle.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,960
Mom!  Madam Oh, please don't.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,830
Even though I want to concern myself with only my own kids' matters, there is nothing to be concerned about.  That's why.

19
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,270
Are you satisfied?

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,440
Soon, there may be something happening that you would be concerned about...

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,910
- Do you have someone? 
 - Do you want me to have someone?

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,780
Tell me what kind of person you want for a son-in-law.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,250
If you don't speak well...

24
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,850
Is my Honey is doing well?

25
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,100
Honey?

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,390
Lee Kang Woo and even Min Hyeok...  The elders would come unglued.

27
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,120
Ta-da!

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,290
What do you think?  This is my new recipe.

29
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,060
Honey?

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,210
Mother?

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,910
I already tasted it earlier.

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,080
Ah, that's right? How is it, you guys?

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,800
It's delicious.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,390
Beef, mint chocolate, crabs marinated with soy sauce.

35
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,570
I mean, it only has delicious things.

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,060
There's no way this could taste bad.

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,450
As I expected, it's Director of Shinhwa Food's Lee Kang Hee!

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,730
What should I do?  I'm Jang Geum (Jewel in the Palace).

39
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,430
I'll serve you.

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,580
Even though I made it, it tastes really good.

41
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,810
Looking at the moment like this, I feel it's a real relief that our company is run without any problem.

42
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,250
- Min Hyeok, you. 
 - Yes, Grandma?

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,430
Your cousin would try and see for one year,

44
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,150
so he took over the position of a chief director.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,020
Now it's your turn, isn't it?

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,240
Think about the position you want carefully.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,090
Are you... going to stop being a doctor?

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,120
- Probably. 
- Is there anything else you want to do?

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,250
Not yet.

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,670
- How about you? 
 - I have.  That's why Grandma was saying I would stay for one year.

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,220
You must like it, having something you like to do.

52
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,450
You didn't become a doctor because you wanted to?

53
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,260
It was said that only the best could be a doctor so I tested to see whether I was the best or not.

54
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,420
You suck but it's true so I can't curse at you either.

55
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,010
Don't do what you don't want to do.

56
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,700
You know our grandma isn't that stubborn.

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,020
Tell her what you want to do.

58
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,310
Ee, oh, ee, oh,

59
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,400
ee, oh,

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,820
ee, oh, ee.

61
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,210
Look, Oppa, my face is super funny.

62
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,900
Ee, oh, ee—

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,990
He won't talk to me again, right?

64
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,140
He's not going to want to see my face.

65
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,440
Good, then. You said you didn't like him because of his face.

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,820
It's good that you don't see it.

67
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,880
Hey.

68
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,990
Go home.

69
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,620
You do everything your way, right?!

70
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,240
What?

71
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,160
 Joo Seo Yeon?

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,100
When did you call him, you punk?

73
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,420
You! You're not supposed to do that.

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,410
You show up, disappear, show up and disappear as you please.

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,660
See, you're angry, right?!

76
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,270
Why— Really—

77
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,350
I'm Joo Won Seok. Seo Yeon has been drinking.

78
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,580
 Did she drink a lot?

79
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,940
Some. I'm hanging up.

80
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,210
Ee, oh, ee, oh,

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,000
ee, oh,

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,990
That... She's going to be embarrassed later. What is she going to do?

83
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,500
Ee, oh, ee.

84
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,150
Okay. Erase it from your memory.

85
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,010
Erase it.

86
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,340
Ee, oh, ee.

87
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,070
I'm the one who got dumped. Why are you being like this?

88
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,260
You showed up.

89
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,270
Not yet.

90
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm human too, so I need time,

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,750
Joo Seo Yeon.

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,300
So you're going to disappear for fifteen years again?

93
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,480
I won't do that.

94
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,260
You promised.

95
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,960
Yeah.

96
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,140
It was a dream, right?

97
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,210
 Recent Calls: Yesterday:

98
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,130
 Mi Kyeong, Mi Kyeong, Eldest Brother, Mi Kyeong.

99
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,460
That's right... It was a dream.

100
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,030
I thought you lost your mind because you were working at the school.

101
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,940
This school belongs to Shinhwa Food, right?

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
You're going to eat up little by little from here?

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,890
What are you talking about?

105
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,110
You're a successor of Shinhwa Food but there is an older cousin.

106
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,590
It's a little ambiguous.

107
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,250
If you're going to say useless things, then leave.

108
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,380
I didn't know you had a visitor. I'll come back later.

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,390
Is she the person who came to our gathering?

110
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,470
Wow, how women look is depending on how they keep up appearances.  I almost didn't recognize her.

111
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,390
Get lost.

112
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,800
What?

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,040
I said, get lost.

114
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm sorry. I intruded earlier.

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,360
You heard everything, right?

116
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,230
If I said I didn't hear, that would be weird.

117
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm Chief Director Lee's—

118
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,030
I mean... I'm Lee Kang Woo's younger cousin. I'm sorry for deceiving you.

119
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,990
It's not that you deceived me, it's just that you didn't tell me.

120
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,030
And I knew already, to be honest.

121
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,500
What?

122
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,530
At the time, when we went to your friends' gathering...

123
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,470
 How did you seduce him?

124
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,990
 Pardon?

125
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,640
 You're very talented.   Are you pregnant by speeding?

126
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,470
 Well, since he is very responsible, the method might've worked well.

127
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,130
 Is she talking on the phone with a wireless speaker or something?

128
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,640
 I'm talking to you right now.

129
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,480
 To me?  Since you said something weird, I thought...

130
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,300
 You're really shameful even when I, as the same woman as you, think of it.

131
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,930
 Even if he is a grandson of Shinhwa Food, how can you bog him down with your body?

132
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,340
 Are you talking about Lee Kang Woo?  Do you know him?

133
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,260
 Who?

134
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,840
 Didn't you say just now, "a grandson of Shinhwa Food"  and something...?

135
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,680
 I'm talking about Min Hyeok. Min Hyeok!

136
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,780
 H-Health Teacher?

137
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,520
You already knew? But why...

138
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,140
Why did I act like I didn't know?

139
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,410
I felt it was funny to go out of my way to act as if I knew.

140
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,220
And it's not like Health Teacher isn't Health Teacher because of that.

141
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,910
I thought that it didn't really matter if you're Sinhwa Food's grandson.

142
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,300
Should I have shown that I knew?

143
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,860
Did I make a mistake?

144
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,970
That's not it.

145
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,320
Whenever the fact I'm a son or a grandson of some family is revealed, people always change their attitude to me.

146
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,240
Thank you for not changing.

147
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:08,560
I really like it very much that there's someone like you at our school.

148
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,490
Let's work for a long time in the future.

149
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,350
You look awesome!  Really awesome!

150
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,000
You look radiant!

151
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,010
Now, we finished our midterms.

152
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,570
So let's focus on the competition that will be held soon.

153
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,220
And our chief director has as high expectations as he gives us special support.

154
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,960
Let's do our best to pay him back for his support.

155
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,330
Let's go!

156
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,690
One, two, three!

157
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,650
Let's go, let's go, fighting!

158
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,040
 Contacts:  Lee Kang Woo

159
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,260
What a sense of shame or right do I have in order to call him...

160
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,620
You're very cold-hearted.  Very much.

161
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,600
Even though I haven't gone to work for a few days, how could you not send a text to me?

162
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,860
What, what, what, what?

163
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,170
Thank you... for showing up.

164
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,330
If you're thankful, buy me food.

165
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,910
Where should we go? What do you want to eat?

166
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,770
I'm not sure.

167
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,170
Only this?

168
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,510
I'll buy you something more expensive, just tell me what.

169
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:16,190
Can you buy something more expensive than what I, the heir of a chaebol family can buy?

170
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,580
That... No.

171
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,720
I really wanted to eat this right now.

172
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,780
It doesn't taste that bad!

173
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,900
Don't say this is your first time eating this?  Of course, you're an heir of a chaebol family.

174
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,010
It was because I was making my body.

175
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,090
Well, that was a useless thing to do.

176
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,940
I'm just asking out of chance...

177
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,110
Did you lose weight and maintain it because of what I said fifteen years ago?

178
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,750
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,800
Sorry? My foot!  Because of that, I got my handsomeness.

180
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,260
You're the only one who doesn't like this handsomeness. But everybody else goes crazy over it.

181
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,440
Here, eat.

182
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,810
It's good, right?

183
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,750
It's good.

184
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
This is my first time eating this.

185
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,350
- Should I tell you how to peel eggs? 
 - How?

186
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,110
Ah!   Is this how to do it?  Ah!

187
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,920
You can go.

188
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,590
You're leaving for the track meet tomorrow, right?  Is it scheduled for two days and one night?

189
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,090
Huh?  You remembered the dates.

190
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,640
- Best luck. 
 - Yes.

191
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,390
We'll meet your expectations.

192
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,380
Even so, don't make the students hurt.

193
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,770
Don't worry, Health Teacher is coming with us.

194
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,590
Bye!

195
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,160
Lee Min Hyeok?

196
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,540
Baek Jang Mi!

197
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,480
What happened? Where have you been all this time?

198
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,620
I told you to call me if anything happened.

199
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,720
I lost your phone number.

200
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,800
Then, where have you been staying all this time?

201
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,120
Do you have a place to stay?

202
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,410
Well, is this place a welfare shelter or what?

203
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,470
Ah, I don't know. The second-floor people can take care of things happening on the second floor.

204
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,010
I'm going to work.

205
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,620
I'm fine with it.

206
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,850
Then everything is alright.  You can stay here for the time being.

207
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,630
Hello!  I'm here too.  Can't you see me?

208
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,240
Who are you? Do you live here?

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,680
Noona! But this really isn't it!

210
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,770
You!  You haven't come home for a few days!  Why are you talking so much?

211
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,840
If you don't come home one more time, you'll die by my hands.

212
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,730
Yes.

213
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,030
- Right? 
 - Yes.

214
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,740
Let's go (formal). Let's go (informal).

215
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,630
Ah, really!

216
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,000
 Put is straight!

217
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,690
This is really small.

218
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,670
I didn't realize when I looked at it from outside.

219
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,420
What?

220
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,500
This is my first time sharing a room with someone.

221
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,340
Oh, yes.

222
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,550
 Without any fear, you brought a stranger into your house?

223
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,390
Her situation is bad.

224
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,790
Oh boy!  What if she continues staying there?

225
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,660
 I don't know. I'll think about it when I come back.

226
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,490
I got it.  Tell my best luck to Joo Hee.  Call me when you get back.

227
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,020
Somehow, I think something suspicious is going on.

228
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,850
How was Baek Jang Mi just in front of Seo Yeon's house?

229
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,890
Why does this jerk keep calling me!

230
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,120
 The number you called is not able to be connected...

231
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,670
She was on the phone with someone else just now but she didn't pick my call?

232
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,320
She is ignoring my calls on purpose, right?

233
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,980
- Pardon? 
 - It's nothing, it's nothing.

234
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,740
Today, you have a flight at six.

235
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,100
Who did you say is going?

236
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,790
High Seven, back-up dancers, you, and I.

237
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,920
Stylists are going to come tomorrow, making it the proper time before the performance.

238
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,540
Are you waiting for a phone call?

239
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,760
No.  I'm not waiting.

240
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,470
Yes, President Choi.

241
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,410
- Did you all pack your things well? 
 - Yes.

242
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,040
- Let's check again to see if anyone's missing anything. 
- Okay.

243
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,060
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

244
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,430
You!

245
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,600
Why is Chief Director Lee here?

246
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,970
What about me?  Did I come where I'm not supposed to come?

247
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,370
- Right, kids?
- Yes!

248
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,330
What about Lee Min Hyeok?

249
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,450
He said he has work to do, so he's coming tomorrow.

250
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,300
Really?

251
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,590
- Let's go, kids! 
 - Yes!

252
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,300
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

253
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,440
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

254
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,160
♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

255
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,750
Do you want some? 
 ♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop  ♫

256
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,690
♫  ♫  Whenever I look at you  ♫  ♫

257
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,120
Your face! Are you okay?

258
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,870
This is my first time on a bus in fifteen years.

259
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,140
♫  What's wrong with my heart  ♫

260
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,280
You're so weak. 
 ♫  It keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

261
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,290
How weak are you? You just have completely fake muscles.

262
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,030
♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?  ♫

263
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,800
Look at outside.  When you have motion sickness, you'll feel better if you look at outside.

264
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,750
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop  ♫

265
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,680
♫  Whenever I look at you  ♫

266
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,790
 Baekje Inn

267
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,660
Are you saying this is our lodging accommodation?

268
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,220
Yeah. What?

269
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,630
Don't get off, don't get off!  Just get back on.

270
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,650
Why are you being like this?

271
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,370
Does it make sense for the face of Shinhwa High School, of which the foundation is Shinhwa Food?

272
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,740
I didn't have any other choice in order to fit within our budget.

273
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,320
Get on. Don't get off!

274
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,980
- Get on, get on. 
- Why?!

275
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,660
Get on! You're not going in?

276
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,430
- Aren't you overdoing it? 
 - It's my choice.

277
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,960
Kids, unpack!

278
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,020
Okay!

279
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,290
Still...

280
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:40,790
Just think of the kids. To do well tomorrow, they must eat, rest, and sleep comfortably.

281
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,480
Isn't that right?

282
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,640
Really.

283
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,870
Father.

284
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,770
Hi.  Have a seat. What an expensive place it is.

285
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,630
I want to treat you since you're here after a long time.

286
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,720
Okay.

287
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,900
You should've brought my mother here as well.

288
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,660
I'm here for a short time because of the matter of donation.  I have to go back tomorrow.

289
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,450
That soon?  You won't even meet Grandma?

290
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,000
She is fine, right?

291
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,580
Yes. She is unscathed.

292
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,570
Here, Father.  Have some drink.

293
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,300
No.

294
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,200
You're not going to be a doctor again?

295
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,720
Even though so many people want to be doctors, they can't be.

296
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,670
Really, it's so easy for you.

297
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:47,560
You haven't given me any compliments for 28 years.  But it took only five minutes to scold me.

298
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,280
Are you not curious about why I stopped?

299
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,820
Whatever it would be, it sounds to me that you just make an excuse.

300
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,780
I'd rather you join in Doctors Without Borders.

301
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,860
If you see and experience yourself what's going on,

302
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,170
you'll realize how extravagantly you're acting.

303
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,490
You're missing out on so many things during your life.

304
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,020
Acting extravagantly?

305
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,440
 Health Teacher, we moved our lodging accommodations!

306
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,650
 I'll send you the address.

307
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,770
I realize what I'm missing out because of meeting you right now, Father.

308
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,380
Enjoy food before leaving.  It's expensive so don't leave it uneaten.

309
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,470
How is it? It's really nice, right?

310
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,860
 Lee Kang Woo is really awesome.

311
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,390
But I don't know if this is okay.

312
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,310
 If he's spending his own money, then leave it. I should've come along!

313
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,490
Come, even right now! My room is really big.

314
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,960
 - Should I? 
 - You're really going to come?

315
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,990
 If I get on an airplane, it won't take long.  Just wait for a little bit.

316
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,370
Anyway, her power of action is the best.

317
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,910
I admit this place is good.

318
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,480
Are you a fool?

319
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,320
Are you sure you were a competitive runner?  You can't even avert the water?

320
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,040
Ha, you!

321
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,380
Oh, no, no, no!

322
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,950
You did that on purpose, right?

323
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,490
Since you're here, watch my shoes so no one steals them.

324
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,880
She is having fun.  She is excited.

325
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,930
Come here and wet your feet!

326
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,830
This sea water looks very clean.

327
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,360
But there are so many microorganisms you can't see in there.

328
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,440
Don't do it. Don't! Don't!

329
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,330
Attack me, waves!

330
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,520
I knew you'd be like this.

331
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,730
If you had known I'd be like this, you should've stopped me.

332
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,500
If you don't speak well—

333
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
Hey!

334
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,500
I'm having fun.

335
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,270
I'm all wet.

336
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,030
But what are you going to do when you are all wet because of me?

337
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,410
When I looked at you on the bus, you didn't seem you well either.

338
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,310
We're going to catch a cold. Let's go inside quickly.

339
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,600
I'll stay like this.

340
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,370
Like this, so you can't see my face.

341
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,640
Let me stay like this, Joo Seo Yeon.

342
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,690
Teacher Joo, I arrived at the hotel but you're not here.

343
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,500
Where—

344
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,730
Grandma, I have a position I want.

345
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,250
 Like this, so you can't see my face.

346
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,690
 Let me stay like this,

347
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,290
 Joo Seo Yeon.

348
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,760
Is this really the end?

349
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,100
What is it with you?

350
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,270
Who are you to bother me?

351
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,080
Why are you making me worry about you?

352
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,310
Why are you making me think of you? Why do you show up when I don't want to see you?

353
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,770
Why?

354
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,330
You don't have to see me if you don't want to.

355
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,000
Just stay as you are.

356
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
I'll make it so that you don't see me.

357
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:57,720
♫  When I miss you, I close my eyes  ♫

358
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,900
♫  I want to shout to call you  ♫

359
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:16,700
♫  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♫

360
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:22,200
♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore   ♫

361
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:37,000
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

362
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,750
 Love With Flaws

363
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,930
 It's nice that Joo Seo Yeon worries about me.

364
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,750
 - Did you have a good time? 
 - I don't feel anything.

365
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,480
 Let's do it once. Do it once with me.

366
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,050
 - Let's do it now. 
- H-Here?

367
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,360
 It looks like you are using your body well.

368
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,920
 You really show your inexperience in dating so obviously.

369
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,450
 From now on, you're my girl, Kim Mi Kyeong.

370
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,550
 You crazy,  why are you here?!

371
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,790
 Why are you like this?

372
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,600
 Do you... remember?

373
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,240
 It's because of me that mom and dad died.

374
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,700
