1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,460
Noona.

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,700
Don't say anything, punk.

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,730
Go in.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,970
First, Lee Joo Hee, now her. What's wrong with everyone?

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,020
 The caller is currently not available—

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,700
Jang Woo isn't picking up?

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,940
No, he's not answering.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,360
Is there really something going on?

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,820
He must've been really shocked because of the fan cam comments.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,940
- Pardon? 
 - He hasn't been coming out since then.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,840
Hyung, I'm in front of your house but you're not home.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,450
Call me. 
  Message was recorded.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,750
Lee Joo Hee?

14
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,650
 Drinking Karaoke Bar

15
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,240
Is she crazy?

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,640
Ow! Ow! What are you doing?

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,960
That's what I should be asking.

18
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,630
Oh, that's—

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,710
Of all the things you've done, now you're working in a bar?

20
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,520
- What? 
 - I thought you had your head on straight,

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm disappointed in you Lee Joo Hee, I'm disappointed.

22
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,440
Who are you to butt in?

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,650
- What? 
 - You told me to not meddle in your life.

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,870
Do you think you're something just because we live together?

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,350
Whether I work in a bar or not, it's none of your business.

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,420
You're going to go back?

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,830
Hey! Hey, Lee Joo Hee!

28
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,170
Two of them...

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,060
live together?

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,080
He said he was sorry!

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,110
What?

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,680
The video... He apologized for the video!

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
It probably wasn't easy to apologize in person.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,550
- In-person? 
 - He's probably not as bad as I thought he was.

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,220
So you guys met? Again?

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,700
Huh? Well, he called saying he had something to say.

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
Why are you here?

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,270
To brag about that?

39
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,040
I thought you would like it if you knew.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,820
Hang around then go.

41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,630
Okay.

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,370
♬    Hey Laura, sweet     ♬

43
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,860
It's you right? The idiot in the video.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,470
Oh! P-Park Seok Min!

45
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,080
Wow, I thought you would die in a hole somewhere,

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,910
but you're braver than I thought.

47
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,320
I'm sorry?

48
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,940
Are you here alone?

49
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,990
I was about to head home.

50
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,640
Why already?

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,810
You want to go out and get a drink?

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,630
♬    Let's turn off the radio and let's go dancing     ♬

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,260
♬     Are you going to sit at home all night?    ♬

54
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,460
Are you looking for the kid?

55
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,160
Yeah, did you see him?

56
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,970
I think he left with Seok Min.

57
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,400
Who?

58
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,020
So annoying.

59
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,810
Who is it?

60
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,960
Oh, Hyung!  What are you doing here?

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,660
- Where is he? 
 - What?

62
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,810
I asked where he is.

63
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,210
What —  Why are you being like this?

64
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,710
What's wrong?

65
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,640
Hyung, I asked what's going on.

66
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,860
Oh, Hyungnim.

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,160
Hey!! Why are you here!

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,660
Pardon?

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,050
Huh?  What? You're something else, Hyung.

70
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,040
Oh, you're here for him?

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Why are you wearing clothes like this?

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
It's my house, can't I wear what I want?

73
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,770
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

74
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,880
Thank you.

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,830
Ho Dol,

76
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,920
let's see each other often.

77
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,140
Joo Won Seok! You're a human after all. Hyung, you're human with a heart, too.

78
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,690
Why would you follow someone you don't know?

79
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,100
It's Park Seok Min. Everyone in Korea knows him.

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,740
So? You follow him to his house because you know his face?

81
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,260
Ah, because Park Seok Min said he would give me these.

82
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,780
 You want to go out for a drink?

83
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,880
 Not really...

84
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,040
 Not really? Do you know who I am? I'm Park Seok Min!

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,460
 I'm not really a fan.

86
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,070
 I'm Park Seok Min, a top star, Park Seok Min!

87
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,830
 I'm a fan of High Seven.

88
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,810
 - Who?  
 - High Seven!

89
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,810
- Who? 
 - High Seven.

90
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,820
Aren't they cool? Park Seok Min said he was in the same agency as they were and he had a bunch of these.

91
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,460
- Fasten your belt. 
 - Okay.

92
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,380
What should I do with you?

93
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,980
Lee Min Hyeok. You're not coming today?

94
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,350
 I'm not going.

95
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,960
- Why? 
 -  I'm busy.

96
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,200
Then when are you coming? Should I pick you up?

97
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,390
Cold bastard.

98
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,420
 Seo Yeon decided to live a wild life with me from now on.

99
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,170
What was that picture?

100
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,320
It took you thirty minutes to get here. It should've taken only ten minutes.

101
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,820
Are you really going to end things with Seo Yeon like this?

102
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,430
Never mind. You probably wouldn't have come here like this if you were.

103
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,030
What do you want me to do? Seo Yeon said no.

104
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,420
What more do you want from me?

105
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,020
Seriously, "the king has the ears of an ass."

106
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,820
As long as I know you're not giving up, it's fine.

107
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,480
Since you're here, take me home.

108
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,070
- What? 
 - What, friends can give each other rides.

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,830
Seo Yeon just fell asleep. She won't come out even if you wait.

110
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,320
- She's sleeping? 
 - Yeah, she's sleeping.

111
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,620
That's a relief that she can sleep.

112
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,080
Sleep well, Joo Seo Yeon.

113
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,230
 Seon Yeon, let's play.

114
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,230
Unni.

115
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,580
Welcome.

116
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,140
Hello. Is Mr. Joo Won Jae here?

117
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,310
Oh, Deputy Chief? Hold on a minute.

118
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,540
Deputy Chief, you have a guest.

119
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,880
Who?

120
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,990
Director Lee Kang Hee sent me here.

121
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,530
♬  I never feel so loved  ♬

122
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,420
♬  I've been having dreams  ♬

123
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,020
 Breach of contract...penalty is ten times the promised contract amount...

124
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,810
Breach of contract?

125
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,350
Lawsuit? Deputy Chief, did you cause trouble?

126
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,400
♬  I wanted it to happen  ♬

127
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,800
I told you to review carefully before signing.

128
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,320
Didn't you read the penalty clause?

129
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,150
I wonder why you trusted me and just signed it.

130
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,470
When one side fails to carry out the terms of the contract,

131
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,520
the penalty is ten times the promised contract amount.

132
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,900
Let's call it even, with a date that's not part of the contract.

133
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,330
I'm curious as to why women like you.

134
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,560
It makes me jealous, too.

135
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,300
Didn't you understand what I said the other night? I—

136
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,400
I know. I know that you're a gold digger.

137
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,980
But at thirty-eight years old,  I have yet to date anyone properly.

138
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,900
It is not something to brag about, is it?

139
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,850
Nine of ten people would say she must have some kind of flaws.

140
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,680
I've never thought that way, not even once.

141
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,470
Right. Instead, you said I was sweet and beautiful.

142
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,020
Of all the compliments I've received, I liked those the best.

143
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,040
I've fallen for your trick, I did.

144
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,750
Ms. Lee Kang Hee, I am...

145
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,180
You see, I am...

146
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,170
I like you, Joo Won Jae. What about you?

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,790
Do you want to continue to eat meals with me, talk with me,

148
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,700
and stay with me?

149
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,650
♫   Your face that I see every day  ♫

150
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,800
♫  Your breath that I feel every day  ♫

151
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,320
 Because of Lee Kang Woo, don't draw the line with me.

152
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,660
 I'm asking you for this favor.

153
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,120
♫  I smile looking at you  ♫

154
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,010
I guess she decided not to grant me that favor.

155
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,300
♫  Why is that you don't see me  ♫

156
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,380
♫  I'm always by your side  ♫

157
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,110
♫  I'm here, who sees you   ♫

158
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,460
♫  No matter where I'm here. Why is it that you don't know?  ♫

159
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,220
♫  How can you not know? Even though I've never expressed it  ♫

160
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,860
What am I doing exactly?

161
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,240
I shouldn't behave this way to the health teacher.

162
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,840
Again you're behaving this way.

163
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,560
Hello!

164
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,760
Why are you doing this exactly? Doesn't your forehead hurt?

165
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,180
Well...it's just my habit.

166
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,290
You sure have strange habits.

167
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,670
I was grateful last time.

168
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,000
If it weren't for you, I would have been a laughingstock.

169
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Wear this on your date with my Kang Woo.

170
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,710
- Pardon? 
 - I can guess so obviously the situation when you dressed like that in the crowded area.

171
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,360
Shouldn't you think about taking care of saving my Kang Woo's face, too?

172
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,940
Or ask Kang Woo to buy some clothes for you.

173
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,440
I guess you haven't heard from Kang Woo yet...

174
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,310
Heard what?

175
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,430
No way! I requested that of you and you couldn't momentarily endure?

176
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,360
You didn't immediately break up with him, did you?

177
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,750
Well, I...

178
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,030
You didn't, right?

179
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,310
No. I didn't.

180
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,750
Of course, you shouldn't.

181
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,160
I'm making a plan that makes two of you naturally break up.

182
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,340
So understand it.

183
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,760
Go safely.

184
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm going crazy.

185
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,190
You, you, look at you.  I thought you wouldn't function properly.

186
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,950
You finally came back to your sens—

187
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,810
What should I do with him? Kill him or let him live?

188
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,140
What is this?

189
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,030
Something similar to the vibe of  High Seven's stan?

190
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,110
 I like Joo Won Jae.  How about you?

191
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,320
No. Don't covet.

192
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,490
No, no.

193
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,150
Antoinette?

194
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,570
Hello.

195
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,650
Who?

196
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,170
I'm Lee Min Hyeok, who works at the same school as Teacher Joo does.

197
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,700
But who do you think I am so you're greeting me?

198
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,920
Aren't you a family member of Teacher Joo?

199
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,200
Your eyes look like hers.

200
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,180
Mine and Seo Yeon's look like?

201
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,670
You're here!

202
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,050
How are you here, Health Teacher.

203
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,780
You don't need to get up.  Sit down. Sit.

204
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,590
Why didn't you tell me there was such a great bachelor at your school?

205
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,020
This man has very good eyes.

206
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,690
He has very observant eyes.

207
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,480
- Oppa! 
 - Yes?

208
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,890
Could you leave us alone?

209
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,800
Oh, where's my brain?  Talk to each other.  Hey, I told you to sit down.

210
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Talk to each other here, at a place where it's wide open, not in the room.

211
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,220
- Oppa! 
 - I'm going!  I said I'm going.

212
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,670
Why are you rushing me out?

213
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,630
Why does he act like this?

214
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,010
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,030
No, don't mention it.  He is broad-minded and good.

216
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,460
But what made you come here?

217
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,770
You avoided me at school so I came here to see you for a short while.

218
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,580
It's right you're avoiding me, isn't it?

219
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,520
Yes.

220
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,640
Teacher Joo, you don't like me?

221
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,620
Pardon? What are you talking about?

222
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,650
Why do I not like you, Health Teacher?

223
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,610
It's a relief.

224
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,970
If it's not that you don't like me but the situation makes you uncomfortable, it'll be enough for me.

225
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,320
- Excuse me— 
 - I'll get going.

226
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,040
Teacher.

227
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,700
Yes?

228
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,220
Would you like to have dinner with me?

229
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,870
- Pardon? 
 - I want to treat you with dinner.

230
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,520
There is a pretty good restaurant nearby.  Their food is really good.

231
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,240
No, thank you.  I don't want to have dinner with you, Teacher Joo.

232
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,360
Pardon?  Why?  Are you busy?

233
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,330
No, I'm not busy and I'm hungry.

234
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,290
Then why not?

235
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,930
I think you would clearly finish up with me while eating dinner.

236
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,790
Well...

237
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,490
 Lee Min Hyeok even came to your house?

238
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,120
I'm not sure what I'm really doing.

239
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,580
Don't blame yourself too much.

240
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,850
Everyone has to settle their own feelings on their own. There's nothing you can do.

241
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,700
 There's nothing you can do.

242
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:17,690
What was bad was that I was looking for something similarities to Lee Kang Woo from Health Teacher.

243
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,050
 I was thinking this part resembles.  It's right that they are cousins.

244
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,060
Do you miss Lee Kang Woo a lot?

245
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,530
Should I just tell Lee Kang Woo everything and get killed bravely?

246
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,580
What if I see him once more with the excuse of returning this?

247
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,900
No.  If I see him once, then I'll want to see him twice.

248
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,060
If I see him twice, then I'll want to see him three times.

249
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,970
No.

250
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,730
What are they?

251
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,070
I thought you might miss him.

252
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,800
♫  Even if I shout while looking at the empty sky, you don't answer back  ♫

253
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,530
His facial expression is as same as yours.

254
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,570
♫  Do you know my sad tears that I couldn't even forget?  ♫

255
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,780
♫  Do you hear my voice?  ♫

256
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:09,890
♫  Thinking you might come back all day long every day  ♫

257
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:18,190
♫  Wandering around your empty place, I missed you  ♫

258
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,250
♫  My painful heart is already covered with tears  ♫

259
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:31,350
♫  I don't even know whether even a smarting wound hurts  ♫

260
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:37,960
♫  Did you know I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

261
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,560
♫  Did you know I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

262
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,720
Was it true?

263
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,490
Was it really because of me?

264
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,050
Are you okay?

265
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,090
You can't get up because you hurt or you won't get up because you are embarrassed?

266
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,330
Half and half.

267
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,580
You missed one "0".

268
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,470
I'm talking about your share of living expenses. It was short by one "0".

269
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,470
Did you notice it now?

270
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,410
No wonder why you didn't attack me even if you looked at it.  You must've been out of your mind.

271
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,770
I did it on purpose.

272
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,840
On purpose?

273
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,070
You've been strange these days. You usually couldn't cry but now you cry every night.

274
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,090
Can you even see with the swollen eyelids?

275
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,730
Did you notice that I was crying?

276
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm your older brother.

277
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,850
I live such a scum life so I'm not qualified to say this to someone else but—

278
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,220
You're the main base of our family.

279
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,530
Right.  Watching you as the main base,

280
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,550
I think your sunglasses are related to our parents' accident, right?

281
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,620
What if Dad had chosen a different way?

282
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,290
What if he hadn't chosen me, who was ugly and mean?

283
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:17,550
I heard that when people see an accident in front of their own eyes, they try to avoid it no matter what,

284
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,370
distancing themselves from danger, even if it would be a little bit of distance.

285
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,650
One of the police said this back then.

286
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,990
Three of you couldn't have survived that kind of accident.

287
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,450
The driver must've instinctively protected you, no matter how he thought about it.

288
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,500
What?

289
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,660
He said it seemed the driver rather swerved the car toward her side.

290
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,030
In order to save two of you in the back seats.

291
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,090
 Seo Yeon.

292
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,310
 Come to your sense.

293
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,500
 Seo Yeon.

294
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,930
 We're fine, Seo Yeon.

295
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,030
You were not for their choice.

296
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,220
But you were for their instinct to them.

297
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,700
What on earth...

298
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,720
Who was I?

299
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,190
You were the one and only lovely daughter to them.

300
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:40,410
And no matter what kind of situation it was,

301
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,320
Mom and Dad didn't want to be an obstacle to your life.

302
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,080
Mom and Dad protected your life and love.

303
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,070
I wish your life and love would end up with uncommon happiness.

304
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,730
 I'm sorry.

305
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,430
 I'm sorry I dared to want Joo Seo Yeon.

306
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,580
 I'm sorry.

307
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,270
 Seo Yeon, don't look back.

308
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,870
 Don't look back and just go.

309
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,150
  Mom and Dad are fine.

310
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,020
 Never look back.

311
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,310
 Good daughter.

312
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,340
 Joo Seo Yeon

313
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,250
Lee Kang Woo, I'm in front of your house right now.

314
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,830
 Do you know this phone's owner?

315
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,820
Who are you?

316
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,940
 There was a car accident. This phone was here on the street.

317
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,270
- What? 
 -  There was an accident.  Accident!

318
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,840
What does it mean?

319
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,170
There is no way.

320
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,000
No, it's not.

321
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Why did Lee Kang Woo...

322
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,280
No, he didn't.

323
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,750
You scared me!

324
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,880
What?  What?

325
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,650
Lee Kang Woo.

326
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,350
How can you...?

327
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,390
What about?

328
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,720
- Where is your phone? 
 - My phone?

329
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,000
I lost it.

330
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,160
On the way here, there was an accident ahead of me.  So I reported it then I might've dropped it.

331
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,890
But why are you here?

332
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,300
- You're supposed to not be— 
 - I like you, Lee Kang Woo.

333
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,600
You–  What did you just say?

334
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,560
I love you.

335
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:23,100
♫  It looks like you're coming to me from somewhere  ♫

336
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,800
♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore   ♫

337
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:37,300
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

338
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:44,870
♫  This night, this night, if I'm able to spend this night with you again  ♫

339
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:52,030
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

340
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:58,030
♫  All of this, all of this, I want to give you all of my love  ♫

341
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,650

342
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,250
♫  Like the small leaves falling on the ground  ♫

343
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,890
 Love with Flaws  
 ♫  Like the small leaves falling on the ground  ♫

344
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,220
 I should not do it to you.

345
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,840
 He also should contemplate and can choose his way.

346
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,000
 You don't like me anymore?

347
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,800
 I should be abandoned by you.

348
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,740
 Hyung, you're pooping right now.  You're pooping because you have too many blessings.

349
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,130
 So you're telling that Min Hyeok also likes that lady...

350
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,800
 You're really a professional player, Joo Won Jae.

351
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,880
 Are you confident you won't have regret?

352
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,960
 I'm very jealous of you, who get all preferential treatment even if you didn't do anything.

353
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,780
 What should I do?  I think my dad saw the video of me.

354
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,650
 I won't send you home today.  Don't arouse me.

355
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,560
 I won't go.  I'll stay with you.

356
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,700
♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore  ♫
