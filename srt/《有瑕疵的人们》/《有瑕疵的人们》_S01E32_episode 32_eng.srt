1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,320
 Final Episode

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,120
- Try this one. 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,570
Did you take these from Chief Director Lee's office again?

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,990
You sure are ballsy.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,680
To take something, not the health office but from the chief director's office...

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,970
My god, just what on earth are you accusing me of?

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,410
Chief Director Lee gave these to me himself!

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,080
In person!

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,370
You're telling the truth, right?

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,060
Gosh, I'm telling you the truth.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,320
I-It's true.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,310
Seriously, if you can't believe me, all you have to do is verify it with Chief Director Lee.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,710
To fuss at a person with food. Seriously.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,020
Why are they being like that?

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,320
They must've been very scared when you took the snacks away from them last time.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,090
I told you to be gentle.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,760

18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,870
What was he talking about? It's completely normal.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,550
Yes?

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,420
Teacher. Did you really give all the snacks to the vice principal?

21
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,160
Pardon? Ah, yes.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,230
Why?

23
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,660
I thought of trying a different approach.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,480
So it was true. I  thought...

25
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,460
Then, I will leave.

26
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,010
- Teacher Joo. 
 - Ah, don't mind me.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,440
I thought that the vice principal was lying.

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,210
I'm worried.

29
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,300
That Joo Seo Yeon may be scared after meeting Mom and Grandmother.

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,480
Then, don't let her meet them.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,530
Love is a crazy thing.

32
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,960
You... You aren't Dr. Kim, are you?

33
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,240
You... Who are you?

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,810
Who do you think I am?

35
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,280
Dong Gu! Dong Gu, you punk, without telling me...

36
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,690
O-Oh, Wh-Wh-Why are there two of Doctor Kim?

37
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,860
What's this? What's this, what's this, what's this?!

38
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,020
So what you're telling me is that you pretended to be Dr. Kim to make some money?

39
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,030
I searched everywhere for my younger brother for five years,

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,280
and thinking that he passed away, I came here to take care of his possessions.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,940
And you met me.

42
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,450
I'm... very sorry.

43
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,120
What about other people? Besides me, did you have other patients?

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,510
No, I had no more.

45
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,430
I'm actually more of a bird-chest (timid). There's no one other than you, Mr. Lee Kang Woo.

46
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,960
My younger brother is not at fault.

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,810
I beg you to punish only me.

48
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,570
I'll take anything I'm dealt including legal action against me.

49
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,140
I have no intention to sue you.

50
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,500
What?

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,520
Just... If I'd met the real Doctor Kim,

52
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,600
I don't know if I would've made it here.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,920
What does that...

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,280
Don't do this again. Mr. Kim Bang Gu.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,770
Mr. Lee Kang Woo? Thank you.

56
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,540
Thank you!

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,600
 - Yes, Hyungnim. I will call you again later.  
 - What happened?

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,570
 Ah, that is—  Father, father, father!

59
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,550
Leave it, punk.

60
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,550
A chestnut sweet potato or pumpkin sweet potato?

61
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,120
- Pardon? 
- I asked whether you prefer chestnut or pumpkin sweet potato.

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,880
Uh...for me... Yes, I like chestnut variety.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,930
You are a complete stiff.

64
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,300
Oh, Father! Ah, seriously.

65
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,060
Don't worry about it, please. He would have said you were too wishy-washy if you claimed the pumpkin one.

66
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,700
 We will give you a call later.

67
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,500
Hey, hello— Hello?

68
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,540
I knew. I knew this would happen. That's why I couldn't be here.

69
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,990
This popularity reigns across all genders and ages.

70
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,380
Everyone is staring at me again, right?

71
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,840
I guess your eyes are shrouded in darkness. There's no one as we aren't open yet.

72
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,080
No wonder.  I thought you were working at the place that went out of business.

73
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,970
- What happened? 
 - Hm?

74
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,110
You're forced smiling.

75
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,590
How is it?

76
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,350
 Don't you have anything simpler? A simple pair goes better with those clothes.

77
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,130
I don't have any heels.

78
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,720
Mine are too flamboyant.

79
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,850
Baek Jang Mi. Baek Jang Mi definitely has a lot of them. Let's borrow a pair from her.

80
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,610
- Should I? 
 - Seo Yeon!

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,120
Oh, my Seo Yeon.

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,160
Oh, Oppa! Oppa.

83
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,110
It's so pretty! What's this?

84
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,720
Ah, this? I'm going to meet Kang Woo's mother and grandmother.

85
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,820
Seo Yeon. You're happy, right?

86
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,540
You're happy, right?

87
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,820
Why are you being like this, Elder Oppa?

88
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,970
Then that's enough. It's enough.

89
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,750
You're pretty, my younger sibling.

90
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,460
You look just like me. We look the same, the same.

91
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,330
 What's that? What just happened?

92
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,450
Ah, that surprised me! You haven't hung up yet?

93
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,500
 Why's Oppa Won Jae like that?

94
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,270
I don't know either.

95
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,080
- Elder Oppa. 
 - You aren't sleeping?

96
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,160
Are you okay? Did something happen?

97
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,250
What does something mean? No, nothing happened.

98
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,970
Really?

99
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,130
I may be an idiot, but I won't do anything to make you worry.

100
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,850
Should I make something?

101
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,020
Could you? I'm so hungry.

102
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,320
Me, too. As expected, we are exactly alike.

103
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,390
Eight would be enough, right? Five for me, three for you.

104
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,660
What? Is it weird?

105
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,250
No. It's pretty. It's pretty, but

106
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,660
those shoes. Aren't they uncomfortable? Don't your feet hurt?

107
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,420
A little. I'm okay.

108
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,170
Are you nervous?

109
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,130
Yeah.

110
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,110
Then should we just leave? I could just tell my mom to see us next time.

111
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,110
Don't do that! Let's go.

112
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,900
Let's go.

113
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,340
I knew you would look good together. I knew I had an eye for people.

114
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,540
Thank you.

115
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,970
The food, does it suit your taste?

116
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes, it is so delicious.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,730
It's good to see you eating well.

118
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,400
Eating well makes people live on.

119
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,570
Mother, (take it easy) you are going to get sick.

120
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,760
To think this occasion is when we officially grant our permission for you two

121
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,150
cannot be farther from the truth.

122
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,660
This is merely a gathering at a meal to get acquainted.

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,150
Yes.

124
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,410
Mom! What's your shoe size?

125
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,530
- It's 230. 
 - Oh, 230?

126
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,680
- Mom, you came wearing flats today, right? 
 - Yes.

127
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,800
Do you want to switch yours with Seo Yeon's?

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,560
What?

129
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,040
I mean, you wear high ones very well.

130
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,700
Seo Yeon can't wear them well.

131
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,170
Stop. Stop!

132
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,370
Why?

133
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,900
I can't tell whether I'm eating through my mouth or nose because I'm worried about your feet.

134
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,900
So because your girlfriend's feet are hurting, you told me—

135
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,200
I ate seaweed soup (customary soup after giving birth) after I gave birth to you!

137
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,250
What's the fuss? It's almost nothing, comparing to what your husband does to you.

138
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,600
- Mother-in-law! 
 - That surprised me.

139
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,910
Mom, Mom! Madam Oh, you'll switch, right?

140
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,720
Give them to me quickly. Give them quickly, quickly.

141
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

142
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,100
Oh, I'm frustrated. Ah, seriously!

143
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,780
Hurry up and switch!

144
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,910
Let me see the back of your heels.

145
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,090
They don't hurt. This little thing doesn't hurt at all.

146
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,070
It hurts. Skin scraped.

147
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,780
Now how am I supposed to face your mother and grandmother?

148
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,610
What do you mean?

149
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,400
You supposedly graduated from a renowned American college? You allegedly are smart?

150
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,640
But why? Why on earth would you ask to switch shoes there? Why?

151
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,370
What about it? You were hurting, and I was concerned.

152
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,330
I don't like it when you're hurt.

153
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,790
I really will do well by Mother and Grandmother.

154
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,490
I will surely do well by them. Assuredly!

155
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,110
Wow! You're saying that Lee Kang Woo made all of these?

156
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,230
He may appear frivolous, but his ability is on point.

157
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,930
The yield on transaction abroad alone amounts to...

158
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,020
How much is all of that?

159
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,620
I was contemplating whether to purchase a house at this juncture.

160
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,100
No!

161
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,980
Why do you need a house right now? Don't think about spending money uselessly and save it up.

162
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,610
Not a single thing about you displeases me!

163
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,280
But why does Lee Kang Woo only make men's clothing?

164
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,520
I don't know. I thought it was because he is a pervert, but I didn't ask because I'm scared that he might really be a pervert.

165
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
He's a pervert.

166
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,440
Who is it?

167
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,720
I found you. I have finally found you. You wench!

168
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,700
You should contract new business since you only have found me so late.

169
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,190
Ho... How dare you!

170
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,610
Don't mess with me anymore! Because I won't hold back any longer.

171
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,420
You little wench. You must be insane.

172
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,200
If your kind doesn't hold back, then what? What are you going to do about it, huh?

173
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,460
Inheritance. I'll renounce it.

174
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,780
- What? 
 - My father's inheritance.

175
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,260
I would rather give it to my siblings as early as tomorrow.

176
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,720
Crazy bitch. Are you threatening me?

177
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,150
That's right. Come to think of it, though I'm his child,

178
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,390
you'd have no right or connection to Father if it weren't for me.

179
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,920
I will send a monthly stipend to this account.

180
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Decide either to collect my stipend for the rest of your life or completely sever our relationship.

181
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:20,430
Would you still say I'm a useless wretch to you?

182
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,290
Has that bitch gone crazy? Why is she suddenly acting up?

183
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,970
How degrading! Unlucky.

184
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,660
Do you still consume a lot of sweets these days?

185
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,530
Saet Byeol used to call you Dr. Candy.

186
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,050
"Mom, when is Dr. Candy coming?"

187
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,230
"Dr. Candy smells like strawberry,"

188
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,510
she used to say. All the rigors of hospital life

189
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,920
were perhaps more enjoyable to our Saet Byeol

190
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,630
thanks to you, I want to believe.

191
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,770
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm sorry for being so late.

193
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:02,040
At times, I think there are things one must bury in one's heart.

194
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,320
Just like I've buried my Saet Byeol in my heart.

195
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,280
So won't you let go of Saet Byeol too?

196
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,330
You can do that now.

197
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,440
 Health Teacher Lee Min Hyeok, Shinhwa High School

198
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,330
 Health Teacher Lee Min Hyeok, Shinhwa High School

199
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,330
I heard from the Vice Principal.

200
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,420
You are taking a leave of absence?

201
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,500
That's right.

202
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,460
You will return, after a good rest, right?

203
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,900
Don't worry. I'm leaving to be burden-free.

204
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,530
This place will remain always.

205
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,150
Yes. I know you will take good care of this place without me.

206
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,000
These guys take more handling than I thought.

207
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,090
You have to coif their hair well.

208
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,820
Don't you think they have some pride in their appearance too?

209
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,160
Why are you so cute, Lee Kang Woo?

210
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,150
Cute? No, I'm cool.

211
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,490
Okay. You're cute and cool and everything in between.

212
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,560
What are you doing in the middle of your task?

213
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,950
I can never hold back when I see you.

214
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,940
What are you doing here? I'm ticklish!

215
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,060
Hey, what are you two doing here?

216
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,530
Were you home? Then why didn't you let it be known?

217
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,110
Because it's my house!

218
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,770
As if we are interrupting something?

219
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,030
Not at all.

220
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,560
Not at all. Why are you guys here?

221
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,440
What are those things?

222
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,770
Farewell party for Lee Min Hyeok and two-two party.

223
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,090
Two-two party? Like a toddler. Why would you have that event here?

224
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,720
Hey, do you know how much it costs to rent a space? Plus, I don't have my own place either.

225
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,740
Then, shouldn't you have asked in advance?

226
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,440
Didn't I ask? I thought I did?

227
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,890
Ah, right. Sorry. I forgot to tell you.

228
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,890
It's okay, it happens.

229
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,810
Give me.

230
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,090
Don't you think you treat people way too differently?

231
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,180
You, knowing full well we will be here—

232
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,590
It's not that. I really forgot!

233
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,930
You...

234
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,750
Do you really know where that ahjussi lives?

235
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,200
Of course, I know it well.

236
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,820
- You have to open the door for it to open? 
 - Ah.

237
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,090
You do have a driver's license, right?

238
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,890
Of course! I finally got it after flunking ten times.

239
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,200
T-Ten times?!

240
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,370
Sis, do you really think you'll be okay?

241
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,100
Yep. No worries. I excel in everything.

242
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,870
Excel, my butt.

243
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,370
All ready. Let's go.

244
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,210
Noona! You have to release the side (emergency) brake first.

245
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,600
Side, right. Side? Side?

246
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,350
Why are you operating wipers when it's not even raining?

247
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,730
Let's just take a taxi.

248
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,990
Taxi?

249
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,010
Bus! Bus.

250
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,130
You said you wanted to experience riding on a bus, didn't you?

251
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,870
Bus?

252
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,930
- Why will I go there? 
 - Never mind if you don't want to.

253
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,260
I'll just take Ho Dol only, then.

254
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,090
What?

255
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,270
- Hello everyone. 
 - Hi Ho Dol.

256
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,960
- Are you ready to go? 
 - Yes, Sir!

257
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,780
Why would you go there?

258
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,580
Because there's a chance High Seven might be there. Won't you come too?

259
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,620
Nah, he says he's not going.

260
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,260
So why don't just we two enjoy it?

261
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,170
Let's go, Ho Dol.

262
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,590
What's this ambiance?

263
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,600
Hello, I'm top star Park Seong Min.

264
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,860
Shall I autograph for someone?

265
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,670
Shall I autograph for you?

266
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,150
Why would you?

267
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,880
Because I'm top star Park Seong Min.

268
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,570
I'm Baek Jang Mi. Shall I sign an autograph for you?

269
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,880
Pardon?

270
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,800
Hey Unnie, shall we go there to eat something?

271
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,570
Sure. Let's get some fried food.

272
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,290
Yes, Hyungnim (older bro not always related).

273
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,490
What did you say? Okay.

274
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,660
Where are you going? Ah, Won Seok asked to see me.

275
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,540
Won Seok says to come? I'll go with you.

276
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,330
I thought it'd be really fun, but it's really awkward instead.

277
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,000
- Should I turn on the music or something? 
 - Yeah, do that.

278
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,390
This is warm-up music!

279
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,380
You... 
♬  I got this feeling on the summer day  ♬

280
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,790
As suspected, you two were (at it) before we arrived.

281
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,850
No. That's not true.

282
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,030
- You... 
- Really.  
 ♬  I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs  ♬

283
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,610
Give it back.

284
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,540
Give it back.

285
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,400
♬  I love it  ♬

286
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,950
♬  I don't care  ♬

287
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,200
Uh oh.

288
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,110
Don't anyone touch it!

289
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,600
Who would touch it. Gross.

290
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,460
Lee Kang Woo.

291
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,570
That noona—

292
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,600
Be quiet.

293
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,590
 I came in hope of seeing you.

294
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,980
 Me too.

295
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,540
 When those two marry, won't there be a chance for us too?

296
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,940
 Even though we don't know how many years it would take?

297
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,730
A mere few years. That's nothing.

298
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,880
Truthfully, there's no reason why we couldn't.

299
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,150
- You came? 
 - Yep. I'm here.

300
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,390
Why don't you come in?

301
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,180
The atmosphere inside seems very serious.

302
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,020
It is a bit, right?

303
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,460
- You said you would depart tomorrow? 
 - Yes.

304
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,560
Return safely, okay?

305
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,230
Okay.

306
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,460
I said return safely.

307
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,370
I said okay.

308
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,140
I said return  safely,  punk.

309
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,620
I said alright!

310
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm only letting you off since you're leaving tomorrow.

311
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,020
Thank you.

312
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,920
Better stay in touch.

313
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,940
Will do, if I have time.

314
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,840
I said to do it.

315
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,650
I said I would if I have time.

316
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,590
Do it, you jerk.

317
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,760
 Seo Yeon, let's play!

318
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,710
 Three months later.

319
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,110
- And for Won Seok? 
 - He's on a date.

320
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,430
What? This early in the morning?

321
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,000
They say the late bloomer's love is no joke. That renown Joo Won Seok is...

322
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
I can't eat any more of this!

323
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,990
This useless jerk. It wouldn't be sufficient even if you were to say thank you for the meal!

324
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,780
Don't you think this is unusually cruel? For three straight months! My poop smells like sweet potato!

325
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,590
He is right. Tell Won Seok to ask Ho Dol's father to stop sending sweet potatoes now.

326
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,120
Tell him to let his dad know that we ate more than enough share of it deliciously.

327
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,980
He said he already asked.

328
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,490
He's already asked?

329
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,740
He said he asked already,  twice.

330
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,600
Already twice? That gramps is a stubborn mule.

331
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,630
No freaking manners.

332
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,600
I guess that honorable elderly is, um, definitely, um, caring for our Won Seok.

333
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,800
It's a grateful situation.

334
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,490
Won't you give (sweet potatoes) out to Ms. Mi Kyeong and Ms. Jang Mi as well?

335
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,130
I already gave them a box each.

336
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,050
Joo Hee also took another basketful to share with her track team.

337
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,560
Is that right? Good job.

338
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,190
Should've given them two boxes each.

339
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,250
What crap are you spewing about a grateful situation?

340
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,180
Have you any idea how much effort he put in to farm the sweet potatoes?

341
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,940
Eat up. Eat up, alright?!

342
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,430
Really? For what reason?

343
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,350
I don't know. He's really busy.

344
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,620
Sneakily preventing me from entering the workroom too.

345
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,000
Why is that here?

346
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,990
Just because I don't like to see it empty.

347
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,800
- Is there no news from Dr. Lee Min Hyeok? 
 - Not yet.

348
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,290
Lee Kang Woo also is worried.

349
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,380
Is Ms. Joo Seo Hyeon in?

350
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,400
Yes.

351
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,620
I never imagined the real Ms. Joo Seo Hyeon existed.

352
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,230
Is Mr. Lee Kang Woo well?

353
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,010
Pardon?

354
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,220
You look familiar.

355
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,010
Are you perhaps the one who found my cell phone for me?

356
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,750
What's that? I have no idea what you mean.

357
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,390
Then please give my regards to Mr. Lee Kang Woo.

358
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,970
Goodbye, Mademoiselle.

359
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,160
What is it? Who sent it?

360
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,540
Lee Kang Woo! Take a look at this!

361
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,790
 Thank you to our channel manager: brengbo

362

 Thank you to our English editors:  singndance4life (chief), awesomeharry (translation), and kristensgem (English).

364
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,400
You can't! Hey, you can't.

365
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,260
It's not ready.

366
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,220
Just what's going on that for over three months—

367
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,900
I said it's not ready.

368
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,020
Alright.

369
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,130
Hey Joo Seo Heyon, wait!

370
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,790
 Thank you to our Korean to English translators:  callmeazena_202, awesomeharry, ehkehk, and hannah_yoon5.

371

372

 Thank you to our Korean to English translators: dramamama989, shawtee, itedeli,  pilar_velasquez, brengbo, and mxover.

373
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,890
 That's right. This is the dress I thought of.

374
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,800
 Thank you, Lee Kang Woo.

375
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,720
 Thank you to our moderators and translators of other languages.

376
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,650
 Thank you to our page designer: justine_desmoulins.

377
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,430
This is...

378
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,970
When it is completed, soon after...

379
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,460
we...

380
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,400
Okay.

381
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,440
I will do it no matter what, with you, Kang Woo.

382
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,640
No matter what happens.

383
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,870
Joo Seo Hyeon, don't let go of me, okay?

384
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,570
Okay. Never will let you go.

385
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,040
Please lay them out prettily.

386
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,900
- Okay. 
 - Ahh.

387
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,930
Oww, our pretty one. Squish, squish.

388
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,800
It's delicious, isn't it? Disappear and make her skin pretty.

389
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,670
Don't!

390
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,650
Hurry. You have to smoosh them.

391
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,710
It's optimized to the drivers.

392
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,550
♫  I didn't realize that day by day, time was passing  ♫

393
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,310
A woman alone can easily...

394
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,500
If you take a look at the interior, the dashboard...

395
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,550
It's a liberating space.

396
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:29,680
My senses open up and...

397
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,120
I visited often when I was little.

398
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,230
When I visited home this time, I felt so welcomed, so I wondered if I was really at home or not.

399
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,430
♫  Take responsibility for my life that was ruined like that  ♫

400
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,500
♫  After leaving me, are you really happy?  ♫
