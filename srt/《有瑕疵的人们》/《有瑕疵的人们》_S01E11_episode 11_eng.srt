1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,290
My pride... My pride is so hurt.

2
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,080
Well, yeah that could happen!

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,430
If we try and we really think it isn't working, we can stop—

4
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,280
I feel like I'm going to die.

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,500
Because I'm so, so happy.

6
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,930
I'll be good to you.

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,920
Yeah, me too.

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:18,800

9
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,940
What?

10
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,900
You're behaving frivolously!

11
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,010
Hey, I'm sorry! I overdid because I was so excited.

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,700
Okay, fine.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,430
Wait here. I'll drop you off!

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,160
This is the right thing to do, right?

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,470
Yeah, what's the point in having friends?

16
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,790
We have to help each other in these situations.

17
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,170
But Lee Kang Woo is more toned than I thought.

18
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,970
He must work out a lot.

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,190
I'm crazy! Why are you thinking about feeling his body?

20
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,860
What?

21
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,220
Nothing!

22
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,720
Let's go.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,550
  Episode 11

24
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,860
- Oh, you still live here. 
 - What?

25
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,130
I've been here before. Your house.

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,070
 Who are you?

27
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,230
 Are you Seo Yeon's friend?

28
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,850
 Goodbye!

29
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,770
 Are you okay?

30
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,440
 Yes.

31
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,620
 For guys, you never know where or when you'll have to defend someone you love.

32
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,610
 So for those moments, you have to keep your shoes tied.

33
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,070
 Here. If you tie them like this, they won't come undone.

34
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,800
- My dad said that? 
 - Yeah.

35
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,810
Because of him, I always tie my shoes so that they never come undone.

36
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,080
Here. Look.

37
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,530
Me too. I also learned it from my dad.

38
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,570
Does he still live here with you? I should come to say hi next time.

39
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,180
What?

40
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,430
The thing is...

41
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,540
- Hey, you! 
 - You?

42
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,590
Why are you—  By any chance, you live with this jerk?

43
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,390
You can't hang out with guys like this jerk. This is prohibited!

44
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,010
Guys like this jerk?

45
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,640
You know my oppa?

46
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,870
My oppa?

47
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,260
Joo Seo Yeon. You call just any guy oppa?

48
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,330
No, he's my oppa. My real brother!

49
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,290
Real brother?

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,140
Why are you lying? You don't look like anything! What are you talking about, oppa?

51
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,850
This jerk!

52
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,130
Why is it so loud?

53
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,500
Who are you?

54
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,720
Why are you coming out of here, you jerk?

55
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,120
Jerk?

56
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,880
Is this your guy friend?

57
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Huh? Yeah. He's my middle school classmate—

58
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,610
Boyfriend!  I am...

59
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,990
Boyfriend? Yeah, right.

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,480
You're the one who loathes any handsome guys.

61
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,600
Hey!  It's late!  You should go in no time.

62
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,990
Go go. You're late.

63
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,130
I'll come back and greet you more formally.  Please excuse me.

64
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,030
Yeah, go. Go.

65
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,770
Okay, bye!

66
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,970
Yeah! Bye!

67
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,030
He's absolutely not your style.

68
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,330
We're just seeing each other.

69
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,040
What does he do?

70
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,340
Step by step. Let's take this step by step.

71
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm so tired! I'm so sleepy and my shoulders hurt.

72
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,130
She has something going on right? What do you think it is?

73
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,200
So they weren't her boyfriends. They were her brothers.

74
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,250
Oh my gosh! You scared me!  You're crazy !

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,860
You beat me like a dog and don't contact me at all?

76
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,320
Is our friendship the one that would be gone if I didn't put some effort into it?

77
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,490
If you knew it, then get lost.

78
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,570
Fine. I think I heard something wrong so I came here.

79
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,240
You really like Joo Seo Yeon?

80
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,420
Why?  Of all the girls, why—

81
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,560
She's pretty!

82
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,030
Ophthalmologist.  Let's go to the ophthalmologist.

83
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,230
There's an ophthalmologist I know pretty well.  He is a renowned doctor.

84
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,970
What are you doing?

85
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,380
Your eyes aren't normal. Aside from that, there's no other explanation.

86
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,360
- More than anything, she's not normal! 
 - What?

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,490
She said she likes me. She can't do that. Then that means she's weird!

88
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,730
What are you talking about?

89
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,160
Well just whatever, just don't see her anymore! I'll meet up with her and try to smooth things over.

90
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,750
It's too late. She doesn't like you anymore so don't worry about it too much.

91
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,100
Really? Great. Yeah. That's good.

92
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,250
Then, that's a relief.

93
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,770
She and I are dating. Joo Seo Yeon.

94
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,380
What?

95
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
What?

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
R-Repeat it again!  What are you doing with Lee Kang Woo?

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,600
How desperate must he have been to ask me that kind of favor?

98
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,210
So you're saying that you're going to be Kang Woo's fake girlfriend until they can figure out a way to be together?

99
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,070
 So that Lee Kang Woo doesn't have to go on blind dates and stuff?

100
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,140
Well, yeah, I guess if you want to put it simply.

101
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,610
If I hadn't seen them together, I wouldn't have done all this

102
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,230
but after seeing them, I felt like I had to help.

103
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,860
He's my friend.

104
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,560
They're crazy. They really think of you as nothing!

105
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,160
How can they ask such a crazy favor?

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,170
So what are you going to do with Lee Kang Woo?

107
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:45,130
We have to make sure Lee Kang Woo's family knows about us so we have to go on super cheesy dates and upload lots of photos

108
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,470
and that kind of thing, right?

109
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,430
Lee Kang Woo!

110
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,200
Okay! Let's go.

111
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,770
Joo Seo Yeon, you're more direct than I thought.

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,810
Mi Kyeong said that this is a really trendy place lately.

113
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,880
- So this is a must-see place if you're dating. 
 - Is it so?

114
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,780
It's pretty! Come here. Here!

115
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,070
One, two, three.

116
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,200
We have to take a picture to look real!

117
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,010
Hey, stay still. If we're going to do this, we have to do this right.

118
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,480
♫  What's wrong with my heart, it keeps fluttering and trembling  ♫

119
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,600
♫  Since when have I been like this?  ♫

120
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,300
♫  What's wrong with me when I look at you?  My heart keeps trembling  ♫

121
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,160
♫  I don’t think it’ll ever stop whenever I look at you  ♫

122
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,800
Here.

123
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,060
Thanks. You didn't have to do all this.

124
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,810
I'll buy you anything you want to eat so just tell me.

125
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,070
Lee Kang Woo! You're kind of cool.

126
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,060
Today was great!

127
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,960
Let's keep doing this! Go. It's late.

128
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,430
It was good.

129
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,150
You're so unpredictable, Joo Seo Yeon.

130
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,810
What is that?

131
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,770
He's better than a real boyfriend.

132
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,210
I even got such an expensive cake in my life.

133
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,410
Today, you're giving her food?

134
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,700
Hyung said he would be late.

135
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,710
What is it?

136
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,980
This! This is a super expensive cake—

137
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,860
Not that. The guy that gave it to you.

138
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,540
What is it?

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,420
What do you mean? My boyfriend!

140
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,770
Ah, please!

141
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,140
You'd never like a guy who looks like that.

142
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,560
People can go through life and their preferences can change!

143
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,290
You also meet all the diverse kinds of people.

144
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,010
Regardless of the race, nationality, or age. Right?

145
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,250
I'm the same!

146
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,630
I have diverse preferences! I want to date guys that are different.

147
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,730
Catching two pigeons with one bean.  Catching two fish with one worm.

148
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,620
Pooping with farts.  It serves a double purpose.

149
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,650
Then let's meet him!

150
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,930
Why?

151
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,480
What do you mean why? My one and only little sister got a boyfriend so of course,

152
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,220
your oppa has to meet him.

153
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,150
Sure. One day...

154
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,880
Tomorrow.

155
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,080
Tomorrow.

156
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
It's screwed.

157
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,470
I know!

158
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,770
At this time, cake... My diet is screwed.

159
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,960
- Hey, were you listening to me? 
 - When I listened, I could guess what's going on.

160
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,800
You said that Won Seok saw Lee Kang Woo! Then he must know, that Lee Kang Woo is in his league.

161
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,750
Really, you think so?

162
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,850
If not, why would he say he wanted to see him?

163
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,570
Has Won Seok ever wanted to meet anyone else you've ever dated?

164
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,110
- No. 
 - See! It's over, girl!

165
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you think there's any of them who wouldn't fall for Won Seok?

166
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,390
If Oppa Won Seok speaks ill of Lee Kang Woo in full swing,

167
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,190
Lee Kang Woo and Park Hyeon Soo will be over.  Finished!

168
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,650
Your nosy involvement to help them would be useless.

169
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm going to go crazy!

170
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,700
- What do I do? 
 - What do you mean what do you do?

171
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,250
Tell him the truth and beg him to pretend not knowing anything.  There is no other way besides that.

172
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,750
I don't know. Let's eat first!

173
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,390
This expensive cake is so sweet.

174
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,010
How are you feeling?

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,500
What time?

176
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,230
What time what?

177
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,620
Your boyfriend.

178
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,150
What time?

179
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,070
The thing is... Won't he be overwhelmed?

180
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,050
It hasn't been that long since we've dated.

181
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,990
Did you say his name was Lee Kang Woo?

182
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,160
Your age, middle school classmate. Sounds easy to find out.

183
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,070
Okay, yeah!

184
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,850
It's true. It's true. It's exactly what you think it is.

185
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,470
You're not really dating, right?

186
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,840
Then what are you doing?

187
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,300
Remember that guy I told you about before? Park Hyeon Soo? He's dating Lee Kang Woo.

188
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,760
Their situation is a little complicated so I agreed to help them for a bit.

189
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,020
Wait.

190
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,890
What? Lee Kang Woo is what?

191
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,240
Can you not say anything to Big Oppa? You know he can be a little conservative.

192
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,040
If he knows we're fake dating, he'll hunt down Lee Kang Woo.

193
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,720
It won't be long. At most one or two months?

194
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,170
Before, I kind of messed up with Lee Kang Woo

195
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,440
so I feel like I have to do him this favor for peace of mind.

196
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,770
This is nice.

197
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,060
I can see Joo Seo Yeon all day.

198
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,690
- Why do you keep doing that? 
 - When did I?

199
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,920
- Vice Principal! 
 - Ah, yes.

200
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,610
I have been staying apart from teachers for a long time, haven't I?

202
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,250
I'd like to buy you all a meal once, could you arrange that for me?

203
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,550
Yes?  Ah, y-yes.

204
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,230
I'll leave it with you!

205
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,160
This way then that way, how capricious.

206
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
Does he have a bipolar disorder or what?

207
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,870
That's what I'm saying!

208
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,830
- Thank you for the class. 
 - Thank you for the class.

209
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,560
A new item.

210
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,160
Hello.

211
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,470
Where is she going?

212
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,720
I knew you'd do this.

213
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,790
So cheap! Getting me to come here with food.

214
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,370
Then you should have come when I asked you to.

215
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,410
If I leave it, it'll heal on its own.

216
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,500
Don't!  You'll get a scar!

217
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,480
You have to think of your body as something precious.

218
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,670
- What? 
 - Just now, you reminded me of my dad.

219
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,310
Don't!

220
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll eat later.

221
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,310
Health Teacher, are you dating anyone?

222
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,410
Sorry, I was caught off guard by your question. No, I'm not.

223
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,190
What's your type?

224
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,180
Let me know! There might be someone close to you.

225
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,900
I think there might be someone close too.

226
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,170
I like someone who eats anything,

227
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,700
who does their best even at the expense of their body.

228
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,770
A good person.

229
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,410
And?

230
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,260
Well, just like that. What about you, Teacher Joo?

231
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,630
What kind of person do you like?

232
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,360
I look at faces a lot!

233
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,820
Let's have a chat, Teacher Joo Seo Yeon.

234
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,180
What? What's wrong?

235
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,360
We have to tell people about our relationship!

236
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,800
What?

237
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,940
Why do we have to?

238
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,080
What do you mean why? It'd be good to tell people!

239
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,260
Hey! You're too much. It'd be great for you if more people know but what about my position?

240
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,870
You're a boss and I'm an employee.

241
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,170
What would other people think of me?

242
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,310
In exchange!

243
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,180
- Don't get close to him. 
 - What?

244
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,130
Don't get close to him.

245
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,120
What are you saying?

246
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,230
Don't get close to Lee Min Hyeok!

247
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,870
Health Teacher? Why not?

248
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,880
- Just cause. 
 - There has to be a reason!

249
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,800
There isn't. Just because. Just don't get close to him!

250
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,870
What's the relationship between you two?

251
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,980
There is no relationship.

252
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,740
In any case, don't be close to him!

253
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,200
What's wrong with him? Why's he acting like that?

254
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,960
 Health Teacher, are you dating anyone?

255
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,410
 There could be someone close by.

256
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,690
 I think there could be someone close too.

257
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,100
Did they have something in the past?`

258
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,710
Why did I tell her not to be close to Lee Min Hyeok!

259
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,150
Even I think I was so narrow-minded.

260
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,670
 Brothers don't look alike at all.

261
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,940
 People say that no younger brothers are as good as the older one.  They are the opposite in this family.

262
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,030
 The younger one is so smart,

263
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,360
 so the chairman has a very high expectation for him.

264
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,140
But it's too embarrassing to say I'm insecure because  Min Hyeok is so handsome.

265
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,530
Joo Seo Yeon, you dare make me feel miserable?

266
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,690
She's really extraordinary.

267
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,800
She's so pretty!

268
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,120
Wait, what? Do you think that this hyung plays in our league?

269
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,810
It's not true, right?

270
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,560
Man, this was the funniest thing I heard in a while.

271
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,690
Ah, this was so funny.

272
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,360
Tell me straight. Is it true or not?

273
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,280
What's going on?  The mighty Joo Won Seok seems to be getting expired.

274
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,230
Can't you tell from one glance? Never. Never!

275
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,460
This hyung loves girls so much.

276
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,820
Really?

277
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,430
♫  I can feel your presence  ♫

278
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,780
♫  Without any words  ♫

279
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,810
Oh, Noona!

280
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,470
Take better care of your things.

281
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,940
How do I look? Pretty cool, right?

282
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,430
I fit in pretty well with them, don't you think?

283
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,700
Did you ask me to come all the way here to ask if you look cool?

284
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:40,210
No! I need this to practice!

285
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,590
Okay. I'm leaving.

286
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,660
 These are the ex-girlfriends of Park Hyeon Soo.

287
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,320
What?

288
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,070
What is this?

289
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,520
That's what I want to ask. What is this? Park Hyeon Soo and your boyfriend aren't anything.

290
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,210
What?

291
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,420
I looked into it because Lee Kang Woo doesn't look like your type at all.

292
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,340
But you said something weird about how these two are dating.

293
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,830
S-Say it again.

294
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,890
So Lee Kang Woo and Park Hyeon Soo aren't dating?

295
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,230
Far from dating, they're not even in our league. What is this?

296
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,810
Joo Seo Joon!

297
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,280
You said this guy works here, right? Where is he?

298
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,420
I don't know!

299
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,890
He cleaned here and there, all the places until night.

300
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,920
Park Hyeon Soo!

301
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,660
What are you doing?

302
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,160
Stay still. If I move once, parts of your body could break.

303
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,430
What's wrong?

304
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,580
Tell me the truth. Are you dating Lee Kang Woo?

305
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,190
Yeah!

306
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,510
It'll break. It's really going to break!

307
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,330
It's a lie! It's a lie! It's a lie!

308
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,950
It's a lie!

309
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,860
Are you crazy? Are you trying to kill me?

310
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,430
Why did you lie? Why would you tell that kind of lie?

311
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,290
I-I was afraid you guys would cling to us.

312
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,040
You guys? What do you mean "you guys?"

313
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,550
Are you talking about me and Mi Kyeong by chance?

314
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,760
So you're saying that you considered us gold diggers so you lied to us?

315
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,620
Well, there're a lot of weird girls out there these days.

316
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,880
And I tried to play it safe so I lied.

317
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,830
Who do you guys think you are that you could deceive people like that?

318
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,840
Lee Kang Woo, you son of b—

319
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,630
Hey! Kang Woo doesn't know anything.  He isn't involved.

320
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,200
Don't make me laugh.

321
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,820
If Lee Kang Woo wasn't involved, why would he ask me to date?

322
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,690
- Hey, that's— 
 - Shut up!

323
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,390
I know that you two planned this to screw me.

324
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,820
What is this? What is happening right now?

325
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,110
Kang Woo...  I have to call Lee Kang Woo.

326
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,030
I have to call him.

327
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,120
Why isn't this working?

328
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,060
What's wrong with my arm?

329
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,440
What are you doing here? You didn't even let me know.

330
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,040
Who cares, we're dating.

331
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,830
I was passing by and I came to eat some ramen.

332
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,050
What?  Are you offended?

333
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,370
Ramen? I don't have ramen at my house.

334
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,990
Wait here, I'll go buy some right away.

335
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,560
Are you having fun? Stop acting!

336
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,080
I'm sure you've gotten a call from Park Hyeon Soo already.

337
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,640
Is it fun playing around with a person like this?

338
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,200
How could you tell a lie like that?

339
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,450
Are you human?

340
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,930
What are you...

341
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,270
Stop it! I know that you're not dating Park Hyeon Soo.

342
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,450
- I'm not what? 
 - It was like this back then, too.

343
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,640
Fifteen years ago, you said you pretended to like me.

344
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,120
- How could you again— 
 - What are you talking about?

345
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,700
Don't act innocent.

346
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,350
 Okay, everyone pay 10,000 won.

347
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,540
 What are you doing Lee Kang Woo?  10,000 won!

348
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,750
 Hurry up!

349
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,770
 Okay, then whom should we do it to?

350
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,330
 - Class 3. Kim Mi Kyeong. 
 - Kim Mi Kyeong?

351
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,580
 Isn't she a little too strong?

352
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,560
 Maybe?

353
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,680
 Then our class... Joo Seo Yeon?

354
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,520
 Joo Seo Yeon?

355
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,880
 She's a little slow, so I think she'll be perfect.

356
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,740
 Okay, then this time, it's Joo Seo Yeon!

357
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,660
 If you ask her to date and she says yes, you'll get all this money!

358
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,830
 If you get rejected, you lose your money.

359
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,020
 Okay, who wants to try with Joo Seo Yeon?

360
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,640
 What'll happen if she says okay?

361
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,920
-  Then you'll have to date her. 
 - Right.

362
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,500
 She's like a dude! How could you date her?

363
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,220
 - That's what I'm saying!  
 - That's terrible.

364
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,330
 Just imagining it gives me goosebumps.

365
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,790
 What do you have to say?

366
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,230
 The thing is...

367
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,250
 Don't do it.

368
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,180
 Lee Kang Woo, don't do it.

369
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,750
 I like you, Joo Seo Yeon!

370
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,760
 Do you want to date me?

371
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,370
 No.

372
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,910
 You're ugly

373
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,520
 and you're fat so I don't like you!

374
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,660
 That bad jerk.

375
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,560
 Come and say sorry even now.

376
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,170
 Please say it was a joke.

377
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:55,230
You did that back then and even this time...

378
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,330
So you're saying that fifteen years ago,

379
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,740
I told you I liked you because of a bet?

380
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,720
Even if it was a bet, I still felt so bad for saying such harsh words to you,

381
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,900
so this time, I really wanted to help you.

382
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,060
But it was a lie again?

383
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,980
You only consider me as trash

384
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,970
who would just confess like that on a bet—

385
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,740
Do you really only see me as that low person?

386
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,110
To me, you're exactly as low as I see.
