00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
 Episode 15

2
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,300
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,970
A long time ago, these days,

4
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,160
now, and from now on,

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,530
I was, am, and will be sorry.

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,890
I'm going to make you worry. And I'll bother you.

7
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,820
I'm going to make you think of me.

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,680
What does...

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,710
I'm sorry for liking you.

10
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,430

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,980
Joo— Joo Seo Yeon! Joo Seo Yeon!

12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,040
Wait a minute! Joo Seo Yeon!

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,620
Hey, stop! Joo Seo Yeon!

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,450
Why does she run so well?  My flank...

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,850
I ran after not running for a long time. I'm lacking in exercise.

16
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,680
Lee Kang Woo, what are you planning?

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,920
In middle school, you misunderstood.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,450
Joo Seo Yeon, I didn't confess

19
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,910
because of what they told me to do.

20
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,280
Wine bar?

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,890
Right.  It's true I resented you a lot at the time.

22
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,170
However, when I confessed the third time,

23
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,990
I really meant it.

24
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:02,830
To be honest, I didn't know about Park Hyeon Soo's lies.

25
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:09,560
Of course, my words in the morning were

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,870
all sincere.

27
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,540
How was it?

28
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,100
It's really clingy.

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,910
Clingy?

30
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,660
No, it's not clingy.

31
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,900
It's touching.  Every word is touching.

32
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,150
You should've cleared up the misunderstanding right away before so many misunderstandings were accumulated.

33
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,000
I didn't know

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,340
that I, to Joo Seo Yeon,

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,220
after a long time,

36
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,060
still to this extent...

37
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,140
Don't try hard to make excuses for what happened in the past.

38
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,000
But keep appealing yourself to her in an earnest way?

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,730
Then the misunderstanding will naturally be solved.

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,960
By the way, do you know how to appeal?

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,460
Particularly in an earnest way?

42
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,050
- Hey! 
- What?

43
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,800
Are you sick?

44
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,620
You don't have a fever, though.

45
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,370
There is a saying when a dog is eating, you don't even touch the dog.  How dare you touch—

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,260
Hey, where are you going without eating?

47
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,260
Joo Seo Yeon!

48
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,260
They're really playing around.

49
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,400
Right.  You should follow them.  Go Health Teacher!

50
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,010
 Stupid Head

51
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,630
 The number you called can't be answered...

52
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,650
How dare you ignore my call?

53
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,020
 They can't pick up your call right now...

54
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,460
No, I don't do it! No, no! I won't do it!

55
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,710
Are you okay, CEO?

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,090
What is it?

57
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,610
I heard a noise. If you're fine, I'll leave.

58
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,780
Oh, invasion of my privacy.

59
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,950
Where did my phone go?

60
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,240
What am I doing right now?

61
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,030
What was so scary that I hid?

62
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,800
Are you okay?

63
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,650
Chief Director Lee did something again, right?

64
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,340
Not yet.

65
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,280
I don't know what it is, but if you don't continue staying here, let's leave.

66
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,960
What? You're really going to continue staying here?

67
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,150
That's not it...

68
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,050
My legs fell asleep.

69
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,500
I feel better.

70
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,320
I just had a hard time because my legs fell asleep.

71
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,180
Instead of doing that, put your saliva on the tip of your nose.

72
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,400
Hey, do you think I'm an idiot?

73
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,750
You only did it once. Do it three times, three times.

74
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,270
- Ah really. 
 - It really works.

75
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,200
How can you as a health teacher act like that?  Just tell me what to do.

76
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,870
We did this in college.

77
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,970
Joo Seo Yeon... So you've avoided me all day.

78
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,800
Even if you did so, what would you be going to do?

79
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,250
Don't you need to report the training log to me?  What time is it?

80
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,200
Four, three, two, one!

81
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,130
 E-mail:  This is today's training log.  From Joo Seo Yeon

82
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,170
Ha!

83
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,680
 Baekga Co.'s Fifth Son, Drug Addict, Suspicion of Sexual Assault, But Baekga Co. Denied All.

84
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,110
Wow, she doesn't have any fear but has a lot of guts.

85
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,770
Lee Kang Hee, you're really something in many ways.

86
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,160
Please show some cars.

87
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,940
Oh, Ms. Client.

88
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,090
How come you're here?

89
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,100
Your name, contact place, and phone number are at the police.

90
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,510
Isn't it illegal if you get someone else's private information?

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,220
I think so.

92
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,180
Which one is the most expensive car?  I want to buy it.

93
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,840
What are you doing?

94
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,140
I misunderstood you, right?

95
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,550
Yes, for a criminal.

96
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,880
So this is my apology that is disguised as spending money here.

97
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,960
You're saying this is an apology?

98
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,010
You don't get any profit with my verbal apology so this is better, isn't it?

99
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,010
Ah, really.

100
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,230
Ah, there.

101
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,580
That's good.  My secretary will come and do a contract.

102
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,650
It'll be with full options.

103
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,000
Wow, she is a very cool jerk.

104
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,620
Did you see the Baek Kuk Hwa, the bounder's article, didn't you?

105
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,100
Because of that, Chairman is in a very bad mood.

106
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,150
If you're helpful to him in times like this, it'd be great.

107
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,510
Right?

108
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,150
Right?

109
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,460
The guy who has 30 billion won in assets, and whom you met last time,

110
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,940
even though you behaved so badly, he wants to see you again.

111
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,590
Just know that. Do well this time.

112
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,510
I can't avoid him all the time.

113
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,620
What kind of scheme does Lee Kang Woo have in his mind?

114
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,020
It's not what you're thinking.

115
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,600
How did you—

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,870
Does Student Lee Joo Hee live here?

117
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,600
She noticed I was a chief director so she opened the door.

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,370
It's cleaner than I expected it to be.

119
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,660
It's cute.

120
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,650
What's this? What is it?

121
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,160
What do you want from me? Why are you doing this?

122
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,330
What?

123
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,410
Saying that you lik—  What was the reason for saying those strange words?

124
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,250
- Strange?  Saying that I lik—  
 - Yeah, that's it.

125
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,880
I just told you my true feelings.

126
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,980
Just act like you normally do.

127
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,330
While you're doing that, if you care about me, that'll be good.

128
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,820
Do you think I'll believe you?

129
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,230
Why? What?

130
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,640
Now I can see your face properly. Since I saw you, I'm satisfied. I'm leaving.

131
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,230
Huh?

132
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,610
CEO?

133
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,720
CEO? That's not it. I'm a chief director.

134
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,100
Pardon?

135
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:08,020
Joo Seo Joon? You're Joo Seo Yeon's younger brother?

136
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,900
You're good-looking.

137
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,160
What was that?

138
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,550
He's the chief director of our school.

139
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,170
Chief Director?

140
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,970
Why was the chief director at my company?

141
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,930
No... Why was the chief director at my house?

142
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,300
He must have come to see Teacher.

143
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,840
Why does the chief director want to see Noona?

144
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,910
What's this?

145
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,120
Are you really not going to tell the teacher?

146
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,260
About what? What are you talking about?  Did something happen?

147
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,020
Hey, do you think it's possible for someone who always lied to suddenly tell the truth?

148
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,480
Lee Kang Woo confessed, didn't he?

149
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,930
I thought something was off that night.

150
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,980
And you two had that blow-up at school, too.

151
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,870
- That night? 
 - There was a night when Lee Kang Woo contacted me.

152
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,420
What did he say?

153
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,050
It probably wasn't real this time, either.

154
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,930
It's real.

155
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,320
Ah, really.  If I tell you this, Lee Kang Woo will be in a better position.

156
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,090
I'm on the side of the medical student from Hanguk University.

157
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,090
But Lee Kang Woo seems much better when I look at his conditions.

158
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,870
Are you drunk?

159
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,100
Right. After they compete fairly, the stronger should survive.

160
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,960
You're drunk. Let's go.

161
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,770
The Park Hyeon Soo case... It was solely Park Hyeon Soo's doing. Lee Kang Woo knew nothing about it.

162
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,700
So, Lee Kang Woo's confession was real.

163
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,690
Get your head on straight.

164
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,890
I think your love life will go crazy very soon.

165
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,010
Why do they have to look the way they do, of all looks?  That is problematic for you.

166
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,940
Huh?

167
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,280
Winter is coming!

168
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,100
Coming. Coming.

169
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,220
This is the last song of Hi-Seven's album title songs.

170
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,000
It's about a boy's innocent and desperate love for his crush.

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,970
The title is "Truth."

172
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,390
♫  I'm always next to you   ♫

173
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,030
♫  I'm here, who is only looking at you  ♫

174
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,700
♫  I'm always next to you at any time and any place  ♫

175
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,410
♫  How don't you know?  How don't you know?  ♫

176
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,910
♫  Even though I didn't tell you  ♫

177
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,020
What do you think?

178
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,660
It's too... old.

179
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,190
Who does unrequited love nowadays?

180
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,010
Something like obsession, possession, mine!

181
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,310
Something like that may work, don't you think so?

182
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,470
♫  I'm always next to you   ♫

183
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,140
♫  I'm here, who is only looking at you  ♫

184
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,540
♫  I'm always next to you at any time and any place  ♫

185
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,510
So... What happened to the two?
 ♫  How don't you know?  How don't you know?  ♫

186
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,840
Sorry?

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,030
The song has to have an introduction, development, turn, and conclusion.

188
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,800
The man who sings this song is going to be able to love his lover?

189
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,630
 I'd like it if you'd stay by my side.

190
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,020
 Joo Seo Yeon. I'll make you worry about me.

191
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,940
 And I'll bother you. I'm going to make you think of me.

192
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,310
 I'm sorry for liking you.

193
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,810
That was all real?

194
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,340
 You only see me as trash

195
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,380
 who would just confess like that on a bet—

196
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,360
 Do you really see me as that low person?

197
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,540
By any chance, was that also—

198
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,290
Joo Seo Yeon?

199
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,870
How did you— I mean, since when have you been waiting here? You should've called me first.

200
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,250
Ah, calling? I didn't think of that.

201
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,210
After seeing that you weren't home, I thought you'd eventually come, so I waited.

202
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,490
What? Did anything happen?

203
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,930
It's just that avoiding you is bad manners.

204
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,690
Should I get you something to drink?

205
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,860
I'm curious about something.

206
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,670
What happened fifteen years ago? I want to hear what exactly happened.

207
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,380
I just thought that what I know isn't the whole story.

208
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,110
Back then... Were you being sincere?

209
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,610
 Okay, then this time, it's Joo Seo Yeon!

210
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,700
 If you ask her to date and she says yes, you'll get all this money!

211
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,030
 If you get rejected, you'll lose all your money.

212
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,340
 Okay, who wants to try with Joo Seo Yeon?

213
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,170
 What'll happen if she says okay?

214
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,870
 - Then, this time I'll— 
 - You can't!

215
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,960
 J-Joo Seo Yeon... is m-my friend.

216
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
 What are you saying?

217
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,680
 Don't do it. If you need money, I'll give it to you.

218
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,670
 So, don't do things like this.

219
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,240
 Wow, this—

220
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,740
 - It's a lot. 
 - Don't do it to her.

221
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,730
Even though I wasn't strong, I had a lot of money.

222
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,680
At the time,  I stopped them, but I didn't know when they would do it again, so

223
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,250
I wanted to protect you by your side.

224
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,390
But I don't know what kind of courage I had back then.

225
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,000
I never even dreamed that I would be rejected by you.

226
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,120
 You're ugly and fat, so I don't like you.

227
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,280
I heard that you didn't know about you and Park Hyeon Soo dating. Is that true?

228
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,790
That— I— That was...

229
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,720
I guess I was the bad one.

230
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,960
I was misunderstood by myself and thought it by myself.

231
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,700
I jumped to conclusions.

232
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
No, you were in such a situation that you could act like that.

233
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,170
It's my fault for not explaining properly. My fault.

234
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,130
You did tell me properly.

235
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,630
Fifteen years ago, and recently.

236
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,930
And this time, too.

237
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,430
I'm sorry that I couldn't give you a proper response all that time.

238
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,960
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

239
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,370
And...

240
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,680
For this time...

241
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm sorry.

242
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,220
Why?

243
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,480
I mean, I know it's a very petty and immature question.

244
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,720
Why on earth?

245
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,740
I was a bit rude, right?

246
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,350
I did that in vain, you know?

247
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,420
I'm immature. I wanted to grab your attention in an immature way.

248
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,280
It's not like that.

249
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,250
What if I do well? What if I do really, really well?

250
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,560
There's no use.

251
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,690
By any chance... is it because of another person?

252
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,700
Is it... Lee Min—

253
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,900
I can't ever like someone who looks like you.

254
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,110
- What? 
 - I don't like good-looking people.

255
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,450
- What? 
 - I was fed up my whole life

256
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,230
with people who look like you.

257
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,720
Wait a minute.

258
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,130
What?

259
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,700
♫  Meeting  by chance, a person who leaves me only sadness  ♫

260
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,280
♫  Becoming a small candle  ♫

261
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,670
Lee Kang Woo will understand. 
 ♫  in my heart  ♫

262
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:11,160
♫  When I miss you, I close my eyes  ♫

263
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,410
♫  I want to shout to call you  ♫

264
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,950
♫  It looks like you're coming to me  ♫

265
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,620
♫  From somewhere  ♫

266
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,540
What have I done

267
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,810
this whole time? 
 ♫  Now, I can't bear it anymore   ♫

268
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,920
 Joo Seo Joon from Class 2-4,

269
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,060
 please come to the chief director's office.

270
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,040
 Right now, at this instant!

271
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,140
Did... you call me?

272
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,290
Sit down.

273
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,700
But... Why did you...

274
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,970
Student Joo Seo Joon?

275
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,600
Yes?

276
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,950
What on earth did you do?

277
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,570
- Why did you bother your sister so much? 
 - Excuse me?

278
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,890
You said you're an HS trainee, right?

279
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,940
That is —

280
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,330
I'm going to show you what hell looks like!

281
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,960
You.

282
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,680
I can test-drive, can't I?

283
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,440
- Why did you live that way? 
 - What's this crazy person saying?

284
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,280
- I said, why did you live that way?! 
- You're crazy!

285
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,430
Pull over! Pull over!

286
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,330
Why did you bother Joo Seo Yeon? Why?!

287
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,060
Why did you do that?

288
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,860
Why did you give Joo Seo Yeon a hard time? Why?

289
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,620
- Sit down.
- Yes.

290
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,890
♬  I fear there's no one to save me  ♬

291
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,560
♬  This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy  ♬

292
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
♬  I need somebody to heal  ♬

293
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,400
♬  Somebody to know  ♬

294
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,790
♬  Somebody to have  ♬

295
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,840
♬  Somebody to hold  ♬

296
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,130
♬  It's easy to say  ♬

297
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,070
♬  But it's never the same  ♬

298
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,900
Don't stick around Seo Yeon.

299
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
That's not your business.

300
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,080
I don't have much to lose.

301
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:06,420
Seo Yeon's abnormal prejudice against people's appearance was caused by us but it was not 100% from us.

302
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,360
There's more to it deep in her mind.

303
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,850
In a very deep place, where nobody knows.

304
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,230
So it'll never work out for you with your looks.

305
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,700
What is that?

306
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,930
Leave after you drink that.

307
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,950
♬  Somebody to heal  ♬

308
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,040
♬  Somebody to have  ♬

309
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,310
♬  Just to know how it feels  ♬

310
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,490
♬  It's easy to say...  ♬

311
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,490
 There's more to it deep in her mind.

312
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,080
 In a very deep place, where nobody knows.

313
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,960
It's one mountain right after another.

314
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,650
Is there even a mountain for me to climb over?

315
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,300
I don't even have a chance.

316
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,060
 Hello?

317
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,000
She said she doesn't like handsome men!

318
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,990
What?

319
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,660
 My face... My face!

320
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,330
She said she doesn't like my handsome face!

321
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,900
She said she doesn't like me!

322
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,100
She doesn't like me because I'm good-looking.

323
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,780
Ah, really!

324
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,900
If you want to pick a fight like that, just go outside and die, you punk!

325
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,480
He only calls whenever I'm eating.

326
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,580
Be patient.

327
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,590
Just hold it in a little more.

328
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,760
I can't eat this anymore because it's all soggy!

329
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,790
 September 2019 Calendar

330
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,430
How many days has Lee Kang Woo not come to work?

331
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,240
Is he planning on never showing up?

332
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,480
Get it together.

333
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,940
Get it together! You don't have the time for this, Joo Seo Yeon.

334
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,030
Noona! I went up one hundred ranks.

335
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,280
Oh, oh, my baby!

336
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,490
Teacher Ho Dol! I made it!

337
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,050
I'm 100th place!

338
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,720
Lee Joo Hee!

339
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,710
Hand it over. Your report card.

340
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,670
How much did your rank improve?

341
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,590
You did really well, Joo Hee!

342
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,280
Thank you, Teacher. It's because you put me through tutoring.

343
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,340
Teacher Ho Dol is really a capable teacher.

344
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,680
I'm sure Joo Seo Joon wasn't easy.

345
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,790
But, Teacher...

346
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,120
Joo Seo Joon...

347
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,320
 Mom.

348
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,950
 Don't tell Noona.

349
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,510
What? Did Seo Joon bother you again?

350
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,350
- I should just—
- No, no.

351
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,300
That's not it.

352
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,580
Joo Seo Joon worked really hard this time.

353
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,700
Yeah, I guess he really wants to be a celebrity.

354
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,790
You worked hard, Joo Hee. Change and come out!

355
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,680
I should really tell her...

356
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,020
♬  Yeah, yo on my heaven  ♬

357
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,440
♬  I need talk to right now  ♬

358
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
♬  Let’s go  ♬

359
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,200
♬  As if my eyes have been captivated, my head grows blank  ♬

360
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,580
♬  As if I’m naturally attracted to you  ♬

361
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,730
 Are you okay?

362
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,640
♬  My feet go toward you  ♬

363
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,440
♬  Hey girl, look at me, I'm coveting you all  ♬

364
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,220
- Focus! 
 - I'm sorry.

365
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,870
You think you're set just because you raised your grades?

366
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,930
No, I'm sorry.

367
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,970
As everyone knows,  High Seven will have a big performance very soon.

368
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm thinking of putting in two of you as backup dancers. You know how important this is, right?

369
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,660
It's a chance to perform in front of thousands of people.

370
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,460
- So get your heads on straight. Understand? 
 - Yes!

371
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,700
Do it again.

372
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,090
Get ready.

373
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,350
♬  Yeah, yo on my heaven  ♬

374
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,530
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you tomorrow.

375
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,280
I really want to be a backup dancer for High Seven.

376
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,140
Right?

377
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,400
Snap out of it, man.

378
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,930
Wait, can I sleep at your place today?

379
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,390
Hm? All of a sudden? Why?

380
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,400
Just... I don't want to go home.

381
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,510
- Did you run away from home? 
 - I can't?

382
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,220
Well, it's not that you can't. But why?

383
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,890
That is...  There is an allergen that causes an allergic reaction in the house.

384
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,460
- Do you have a dog? 
 - What?

385
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,800
That's right. It is a dog.
