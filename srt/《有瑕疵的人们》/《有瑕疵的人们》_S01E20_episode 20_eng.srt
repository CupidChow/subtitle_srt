00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,640
 Episode 20 

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,740
Should we tell Seo Yeon?

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,510
After all this time?

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,680
I'm wondering if hiding it from her is the right thing to do.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,730
If she figures out...

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:24,160
And what if she remembers? Wouldn't that be worse?

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,880
We have to hope that doesn't happen.

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,400
 Ms. Lee Kang Hee 

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,500
Hello?

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,180
Right now?

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,070
Yes.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,690
I'm going to leave for a bit.

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,500
Who is it this time?

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,130
I saw new shirts and suits in your room.

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,120
Is there still someone who would buy that for you?

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,360
It's not like that.

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,470
Stop it, Hyung.

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,920
I told you it's not that.

19
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,250
What are you doing?

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,610
Is all of this really all yours,  Lee Kang Hee?

21
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,650
If I say it's all ours, it's misleading.

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,900
But it's true we own the most shares.

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,400
I never expected myself being a servant of a chaebol member.

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,660
It's not a servant but it's clearly a contracted worker.

25
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,480
Let's go.

26
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,470
Let's go comfortably.

27
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,300
You can just tell it's a freaking expensive place.

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,170
Are you doing a business meeting at this hour, too?

29
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,780
It's a kind of waging a war of nerves.  Beating the opposite up with a drink.

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,680
Beating up—?

31
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,520
You're using the brutal words.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,300
Then I'll see you later.

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,280
♬  Baby  ♬

34
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,500
♬  Baby  ♬

35
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,520
- See you soon. 
 - Aigoo.

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,620
- Let's do that. 
 - It was nice to meet you.

37
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,760
I'll see you next time.

38
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,230
Are you okay?

39
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,480
Yes. I'm fine.

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,640
You can't drink very well, can you?

41
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,560
There are probably drivers at the company, so why me?

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,290
Because they're from the company.

43
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,240
They'll have to report it to the higher-ups.

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,030
I don't want my grandma or my dad to know about this side of me.

45
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,820
Why do you go that far?

46
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,340
Because if I don't, my dad will have to.

47
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,070
My dad likes drawing pictures.

48
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,120
He used to draw pictures occasionally when I was a kid.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,880
I still remember how happy he was.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,340
But while my uncle declared he didn't want to take over Grandma's company,

51
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,610
my kind dad couldn't say that he didn't want to do it either.

52
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,260
So I have to cover him to the best of my ability.

53
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,630
Lee Kang Hee, you're a warmer person than I thought you were.

54
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,820
You seem like you wouldn't bleed even if I were to stab you with a needle.

55
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,470
Are you always so generous complimenting someone else?

56
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,270
"You're pretty." " You're warm."  Isn't it hard to say in the presence of someone else?

57
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,690
When you want to hit on someone, what could you not say?

58
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,320
Are you still hitting on me?

59
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,070
- And would you even get hit on if I were to? 
- It depends on how you do.

60
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,710
- Pardon? 
 - You are, too.

61
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,320
You are also a warmer person than I thought.

62
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,920
I should keep your working hours written on the contract.

63
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,160
If you arrive at your home past midnight, let me know.  I'll pay overtime.

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
I'll drive you to your house.

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,940
It takes ten minutes if I walk.

66
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,470
I also should sober up by getting fresh air so I won't make my parents worry.

67
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,350
 As you all know, 

68
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,330
Chief Director Lee Kang Woo

69
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,020
resigned from his position due to personal reasons.

70
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,120
However, very luckily,

71
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,050
someone who is renowned for virtues and a great character,

72
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,560
is appointed to the chief director position.

73
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,640
Let me introduce you

74
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,170
to Health Teache— no, Chief Director Lee Min Hyeok.

75
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,850
Wow.

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,830
I'm Lee Min Hyeok.

77
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,310
Applause! Congratulations.

78
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,640
Well, well, teachers, please get ready for your classes!

79
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,530
Ah, congratulations.

80
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,460
You saw, right? That people change.

81
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,880
Are you... angry at me?

82
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,520
When I said, "let's work together for a long time," I didn't mean it in this way.

83
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,490
Do you think Kang Woo suits the chief director position better than I do?

84
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:26,290
Or are you sad to send Kang Woo off due to your own greed, rather than for the wellbeing of the children?

85
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,980
The proverb that position changes people is not wrong.

86
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:40,130
You said the other people changed, but it seems like you're the one that changed.

87
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,290
Well since I have a class, I'm going to get going.

88
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,130
Are you at war?  Why are you eating food so combatively?

89
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,170
What's wrong with you?

90
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,730
What about?

91
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,050
Even if a drop of water was splashed on you, you would make a big fuss and take off your pants first...

92
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,560
Joo Seo Yeon is done with class!

93
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,040
That, that...  The way he acts looks like he is a mutt not a human.  What is he doing?

94
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,750
Wait a minute. If Joo Seo Yeon is off work, then Kim Mi Kyeong must be as well.

95
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,850
 Kim Mi Kyeong 

96
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,430
 Don't call me! 

97
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,260
 Don't! 

98
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,600
I like her so much.

99
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,550
Since I heard your voice today, I'm satisfied.

100
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,330
She's so cute.

101
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,470
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

102
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,380
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,130
I was rude earlier.

104
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,200
To be honest, there's no one that would suit the chief director position more than you.

105
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,720
You're right.

106
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,160
I acted like that due to my personal reasons, not for the kids.

107
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,920
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,230
Am I also supposed to apologize?

109
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,180
I took on the position due to personal reasons as well.

110
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
I wanted to remove Kang Woo from your sight.

111
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,010
What?

112
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,670
I like you,

113
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,610
Joo Seo Yeon.

114
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,060
Lee Kang Woo, I'm in front of your house right now. Where are you?

115
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,210
 Me? I'm in front of your house. 

116
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,530
What?

117
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,180
Why are you there? No, how long were you there?

118
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,220
No, it's fine. Just stay there and don't move.

119
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,380
Ah, dummy. I should've called him first.

120
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,800
 It came out without me realizing it. 

121
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,240
 I like you, Joo Seo Yeon. 

122
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,350
 For quite awhile, 

123
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,880
 I like you a lot. 

124
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,580
 I... 

125
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,520
 I... 

126
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,020
 I like Kang Woo. 

127
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,690
 Yes. 

128
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,530
 I like Lee Kang Woo. 

129
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,140
 The words that I like Lee Kang Woo 

130
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,610
 just came out. 

131
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,560
- What are you doing? 
 - That startled me!

132
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,020
Oh...

133
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,850
What are you doing here?

134
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,630
I was just... going to pick you up at school,

135
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,450
but I thought it would be embarrassing to see anyone there.

136
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,980
What about you?

137
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,250
Why did you go to my house?

138
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,350
I went there to request a date.

139
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,130
What?

140
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,150
I thought about it

141
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,550
and wanted to take things slowly, just as how others do it.

142
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,850
We've been all confused until now.

143
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,410
Let's go on a date, Lee Kang Woo.

144
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,060
Let's go.

145
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,740
What did you just say?

146
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,400
I said, let's have fun together.

147
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,890
I think you said something different!

148
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,980
No, I said that. Let's play.

149
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,970
- No, that's not it. 
 - Get in the car quickly.

150
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,690
Let's play!

151
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,870
 Seo Yeon, let's play! 

152
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,630
It's really pretty, right?

153
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,520
It's so pretty.

154
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,080
It's my first time coming to a place like this. Should we take a picture?

155
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,460
One, two, three. 
  ♫  It's weird,  I'm thinking of you too much  ♫

156
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,750
Woah! 
  ♫  It's more serious these days  ♫

157
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,520
♫  My face is flushed again   ♫

158
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,330
- Get that one for me. 
- Which one?
- That one, that one.

159
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,190
- That one? 
- The one on the inside.
- I think I can make it!

160
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,310
Ah, you didn't make it! 
 ♫  I think I've gone crazy,  I think of you all day  ♫

161
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,060
♫  It's worse at night than during the day, do you know how my heart feels?  ♫

162
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,920
What is this?  You're very good.
 What should I do really? Thinking of you ♫

163
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Eat. Eat.

164
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,520
It tastes good, right.  Seems you enjoy it. 
 ♫  Thinking of you, thinking of you, my eyes are filled with you  ♫

165
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,550
♫  By any chance, I'm afraid you know how I feel, I'm pounding  ♫

166
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,780
- Should we try this? 
- Yeah.

167
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,170
It's similar.

168
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,620
To your wedding dress.

169
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,580
Do you remember?

170
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,150
 Hey, Lee Kang Woo. 

171
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,740
 You look so cool. 

172
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,010
 Are you getting married? 

173
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,190
 Wow... 

174
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,550
 N-No. 

175
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,600
 Normally the groom wears that in a wedding. 

176
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,950
 That... 

177
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,720
 I thought that our little groom was getting married. 

178
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,300
 Ah, it's so cool.  You look very nice. 

179
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,070
 It'll go well with it very well. 

180
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,390
 Ah, with the wedding dress I've been thinking of. 

181
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,580
 I'm done drawing it. 

182
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,850
 Really? Show it to me, quickly, quickly! 

183
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,920
 You can't make fun of me. 

184
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,770
 Oh, definitely not. I promise. 

185
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,930
 That's right, this is it! The dress I've been thinking of. 

186
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,770
 Thank you, Lee Kang Woo! 

187
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,990
 You're a genius. 

188
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,120
 How do you draw so well? Thank you. 

189
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,880
I've been thinking...

190
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,400
What more thoughts?

191
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,030
You thought a lot today.

192
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,630
Did something happen?

193
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,240
I think this is what I wanted to say.

194
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,020
That day fifteen years ago, when I asked for your address.

195
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,250
Did you remember?

196
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,530
No. I just guessed it.

197
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,700
What were you going to say?

198
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,080
That I also like you.

199
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,170
What?

200
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,100
I am going to take the picture!

201
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,470
Look forward, please.

202
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,840
One, two, three.

203
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,310
Honey.

204
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,350
He must be going through a lot.

205
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,220
That clean kid left his dishes just as they were.

206
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,510
Who am I talking to? Honey?

207
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,920
Where are you, Honey?

208
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,060
What are you doing there?

209
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,470
What? No.  Honey, let's go now.  Let's go.

210
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,720
Why?

211
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,070
Why would we stay in an empty house if Kang Woo isn't even here? Let's go.

212
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,370
You're being weird.

213
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,320
- What's weird? Let's go! 
 - It's weird!

214
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,560
Honey! Honey! No, you can't!

215
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,190
What do I do? Wait a moment, what should I do?

216
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,530
Ah! Honey, my shoulder! My shoulder!

217
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,990
Ah! Honey! My

218
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,120
- shoulder! 
 - This rascal.

219
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,480
What has he been doing?

220
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,880
I think I broke my shoulder bone. I need to go to the hospital.

221
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,660
Let's go to the hospital quickly. Let's go quickly.

222
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,070
Stay still!

223
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,550
What is all of this?!

224
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,240
I can't do this. Ah.

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This woman...

226
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,100
 Min Hyeok! 

227
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,760
-  But who is she? 
 - Let's go. 

228
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,940
Don't tell Kang Woo.

229
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,410
Okay.

230
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,360
Are you done crying?

231
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,830
Crying? As if!

232
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,200
Then why did you want to watch a movie?

233
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,130
The highlight of dating!  Watching a movie!   Didn't you know that?

234
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,100
Watching a movie is the highlight of dating?

235
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,960
When you watch TV drama, they do.

236
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,050
While watching a movie, they do like this at the scary scene.

237
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,390
Women throw themselves in men's arms.

238
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,050
Did you think that'd work on me?

239
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,670
I didn't, so that's why I wanted to watch a sad movie.

240
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,050
If you cried, I'd wipe your tears.

241
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,210
I can hold you in my arms and pat you.

242
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,130
So did you think that would work on me?

243
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,150
Were you really not sad?

244
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,780
Puppy was going on 30,000 Li (~ 7321 miles), looking for its owner?

245
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,900
While it was getting all kinds of abuse and molestation from human beings.

246
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,470
It's sad and sorrowful.

247
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't cry because of that.

248
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,980
You're strong. You're definitely a strong woman.

249
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,260
I can't do it.

250
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,450
I can't cry, no matter what the situation.

251
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,680
No matter how sad a movie or book is, tears don't come out.

252
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,220
 I'm sad. 

253
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,630
 One tear, can just one tear come out? Huh? 

254
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,950
 But as time passed, things got better little by little. 

255
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,740
 Even if it goes slowly, 

256
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,910
 Little by little, things will get better. 

257
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,370
After the day, I haven't cried.

258
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,080
For fifteen years, not even once.

259
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,220
I'm very dried and a lot of parts of me here and there are out of order.

260
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,640
But would you be okay?

261
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,240
What does that mean?

262
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:43,480
Can I interpret it as you want to start dating me?

263
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,240
Can you handle me who is such as this?

264
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,450
It took fifteen years for us to start again.

265
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,250
Back then, we might have had an unfortunate karmic fate.

266
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,280
Do you think I would lose this second chance that has been so hard to get?

267
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,240
You're over, Joo Seo Yeon.

268
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,940
♬  He doesn’t look back  ♬

269
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,110
I heard you were appointed to the chief director of Shinhwa High School.

270
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,290
Yes.

271
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,820
Okay. You might be better suited for that position than Kang Woo.

272
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,200
But, Kang Woo said he'd do it for one year.

273
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
You should've waited a little bit.

274
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,000
Did you call me at this time to tell me that?

275
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,500
♬  I guess I couldn't take my eyes off him for a second  ♬

276
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,670
♬  I'm not ashamed of him  ♬

277
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,320
This was at Kang Woo's home.  It's her, right?

278
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,830
The lady who was with you at the department store.

279
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,560
Yes.

280
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,530
I thought you were dating.

281
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,220
I know, right.

282
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,750
No? So you're not dating that girl?

283
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,600
♬  Where did you leave in a hurry?  ♬

284
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,560
No.

285
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,700
♬  Why do I still love you?  ♬

286
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,910
Then by any chance... Kang Woo is...

287
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,520
♬  Why do I sing about you  ♬

288
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,270
It's not always bad that I can't tell a lie, in a situation like this.

289
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,620
♬  Are you going with holding his hand  ♬

290
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,860
Because I can make an excuse that I don't have a choice.

291
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,000
♬  Oh, that's  ♬

292
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,440
Ask, Aunt.

293
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,940
I'll answer you.

294
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,810
♬  Why do I still love you  ♬

295
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,930
♬  Why do I sing about you  ♬

296
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,050
This girl, what relationship does she have with Kang Woo?

297
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,490
Hyung likes her.

298
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,400
He is probably thinking of marriage with her.

299
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,270
♬  Say love you  ♬

300
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,770
♬  Baby I love you  ♬

301
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,230
Alright... I got it.

302
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,500
Thank you for telling me.

303
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,510
♬  Oh, that's what's keeping me hot  ♬

304
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,650
♬  A warm knuckles  ♬

305
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,850
♬  I can't shake it off if I try to push it away  ♬

306
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,460
 I like Lee Kang Woo. 

307
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,130
 Yes... I like Lee Kang Woo. 

308
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,710
 I guessed so. 

309
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,630
 I can't support you two but I won't disturb you. 

310
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,690
 Thank you. 

311
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,920
 And... 

312
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,060
 I'm sorry. 

313
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,170
 You're a kind person, Health Teacher. 

314
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,040
I told you I'm not a kind person.

315
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,230
 That I also like you. 

316
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,720
As soon as I wake up, I'll see Joo Seo Yeon.

317
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,630
 I have something to tell you. 

318
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,580
 What's your address? I'll come right now. 

319
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,010
 Mom! 

320
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,790
 Please save me. 

321
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,070
 Save us. 

322
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,650
Do you want to eat?

323
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,700
I was there.

324
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,550
I was also there, at that place.

325
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,310
What did you say?

326
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,810
I asked them to go with me.

327
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,710
What's going on with you?

328
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,090
I told Mom and Dad to go together.

329
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,300
 Right now? 

330
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,890
 Yes. Lee Kang Woo just sent his address.  

331
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,270
 I'm going to go to Lee Kang Woo's house and tell him what you told me to tell him, to say sorry. 

332
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,810
 I'm going to apologize to him in person that it was not my sincere heart. 

333
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,960
 Then he may forgive me. 

334
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,610
 Can't you do it at school tomorrow? 

335
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,100
 We're going to go on a field trip tomorrow. 

336
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,000
 I have to apologize today so I can play with Lee Kang Woo tomorrow. 

337
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,820
 Mom... 

338
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,590
 Okay. I will drop you off. 

339
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,790
 Really? 

340
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,590
 You, Honey.  You drank a can of beer a little bit ago.  You can't drive. 

341
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,820
 Right.  What should you do, Seo Yeon? 

342
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,490
 Mom... 

343
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,680
 Alright. I'll go. 

344
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,200
 I'm coming, too. 

345
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,820
 Why are you coming? 

346
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,710
 I want to see exactly who this guy is. 

347
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,660
 I want to see which guy is giving our Seo Yeon a hard time. 

348
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,240
 Let's go! 

349
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,620
 - I'll put some more clothes on. 
 - Okay. 

350
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,390
 What about Seo Joon? 

351
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,620
 He just fell asleep.  He probably will have slept for three hours. 

352
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,570
 Let's be back quickly. 

353
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,880
 Won Jae! 

354
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,040
 Won Jae, we'll be out with Seo Yeon and back soon. 

355
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,180
 Watch whether Seo Joon would wake up or not. 

356
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,110
 Yes?  Yes. 

357
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,120
 Seo Yeon, what are you doing? Come out quickly? 

358
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,030
 Yes. 

359
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,570
 Seo Yeon... 

360
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,710
 Come to your senses. 

361
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,030
 Seo Yeon... 

362
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,120
 Dad... 

363
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,350
 It's okay. 

364
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,870
 It's okay, Seo Yeon. 

365
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,810
 For guys, you never know where or when you'll have to defend someone you love. 

366
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:07,720
 So for those moments, you have to keep your shoes tied. 

367
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,660
Ah, that's right.

368
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,000
Joo Seo Yeon.

369
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,710
 Do you think I would lose this second chance that has been so hard to get? 

370
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,450
I told them to go. It was because of me

371
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,410
that Mom and Dad passed away.

372
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,150
It was because of me.

373
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:19,650
 There doesn't exist the second chance, something like that to us. 

374
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:28,460
♫  Thinking you might come back all day long  ♫

375
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,090
♫  Wandering around your empty place  ♫

376
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,790
♫  I missed you  ♫

377
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:42,040
♫  My painful heart is covered with tears  ♫

378
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,700
 Love With Flaws 

379
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,110
 I have lived without knowing anything. 

380
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,280
 I'll wait for you, staying quietly. 

381
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,980
  Even though I miss you, I hold back.  You aren't tired of me, are you? 

382
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,270
 I think it's a good time. 

383
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,800
 Don't touch him.  If you keep touching him, I'm getting crappy. 

384
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,340
 Did you see Lee Joo Hee just now?  What is with your appearance? 

385
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,490
 Let's call off the contract. 

386
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,070
 Have you seen this person around you? 

387
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,000
 What on earth is going on in this house? 

388
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,320
 - What are you doing right now? 
 - Don't let your guard down, Hyung. 

389
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,000
 If you stumble even a little bit, I won't lose that chance.
