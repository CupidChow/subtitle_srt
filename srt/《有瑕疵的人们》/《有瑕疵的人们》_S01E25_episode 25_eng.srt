1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,690

2
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,810
They said it would rain.

3
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,470
I just came to pick you up.

4
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:56,070
I like Lee Kang Woo.

5
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,760
I know.

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,810
I'm going to continue liking him alone.

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,660
I continue liking you alone, too.

8
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,530
You really are a strange person.

9
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,200
Why are you crying?

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,830
- What are you doing? 
 - She's crying!

11
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,470
Joo Seo Yeon, you can't cry.

12
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,390
Why are you crying? You can't cry.

13
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,520
If you cry...

14
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,520
Please go.

15
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,160
Joo Seo Yeon!

16
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,470
Joo Seo Yeon! Don't go!

17
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,660
Joo Seo Yeon! Joo Seo Yeon!

18
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,810
Don't act like a kid!

19
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,210
Get up.

20
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,030
♫  Our past story  ♫

21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,160
Are you okay?

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,750
♫  I spent my nights with tears of missing you  ♫

23
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,210
Let me see if you got hurt.

24
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,300
Why is Joo Seo Yeon crying?

25
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm the one who should be crying.

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,280
Why is she crying?

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,600
♫  Do you know my sad tears that I couldn't even forget?  ♫

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,730
♫  Do you hear my voice?  ♫

29
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,820
♫  Thinking you might come back all day long every day  ♫

30
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,450
♫  Wandering around your empty place  ♫

31
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,190
♫  I missed you  ♫

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,230
♫  My painful heart is already covered with tears  ♫

33
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:26,300
♫  I don't even know whether even a smarting wound hurts  ♫

34
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:35,200
♫  Do you know I was waiting for you like this?  ♫

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,720
Oppa.

36
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,440
 Episode 25

37
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,470
Stop crying.

38
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,550
I want to but I can't stop.

39
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,640
Noona!

40
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,960
What's going on? Why's she like that?

41
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,930
Get out.

42
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,350
Why? Are you busy again? Why are you always busy?

43
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,430
- Get out. 
 - I have something to say!

44
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,100
Noona! Noona!

45
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,120
Here.

46
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,710
Don't tell First Oppa.

47
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,700
It'll be a big problem if he doesn't know.

48
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,060
If he knows, it'll be an even bigger problem.

49
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,690
Wash up. You're going to catch a cold.

50
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,560
I dragged you over here but I can't bathe you.

51
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,920
Why not?

52
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,350
If you're a doctor, you should help wounded people.

53
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,830
Get a grip.

54
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,220
It's degrading to speak with someone who's out of their mind.

55
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm going.

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,690
What are you doing?

57
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,160
Let's sleep together.

58
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,590
What?

59
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,500
I don't want to be alone today.

60
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,520
It doesn't have to be with me though.

61
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,890
Seriously...

62
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,520
Your face is going to bruise.

63
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,390
Who's fault is that?

64
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,400
That's why you should've listened to me.

65
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,480
Why do you like teacher Joo so much?

66
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,460
Why do you like her?

67
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,100
Because she's Joo Seo Yeon.

68
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,150
What's wrong with you?

69
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,610
You rude little prick. How can you call a noona (an older female) by her first name?

70
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,020
You're right.

71
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,140
If I can't, you can't, either.

72
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,620
What a crooked mind!

73
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,970
And Hyung, it's not because you are the grandson of Shinhwa Food.

74
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,460
There's another reason so it doesn't have to do with me.

75
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,320
 What is it? What exactly is it?

76
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,120
 I don't love you, that's the reason.

77
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,480
 I don't love you.

78
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,500
 I don't love you. I don't love you.

79
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,100
 I don't love you. I don't love you.

80
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,390
No! No! No!

81
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,150
No! I said No!

82
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,060
- Ugh really! 
 - No, it can't be!

83
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,420
No!

84
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,090
Thanks for today.

85
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,470
You can just come back early like that?

86
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,310
I have to go to work tomorrow.

87
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,720
I'll go back to mom on the test day.

88
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,110
Mother will be fine.

89
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,220
Don't cry. If you cry, I'll cry too!

90
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,540
You're good.

91
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,850
Eat first then sleep. You have food, right?

92
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,490
She's worse than Lee Kang Woo.

93
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,560
There's only rice and eggs.

94
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,520
You should answer it. It's been ringing for a while.

95
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,360
Eat up.

96
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,310
Eat. I'm going to leave after I see you eat everything.

97
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,410
Stop crying!

98
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,490
Is it good?

99
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,510
Eat a lot.

100
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,090
You're not wearing those to look cool, right?

101
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,010
Teacher!

102
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,390
Your eyes!

103
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,440
Do you have an eye disease?

104
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,930
Two cod roe.

105
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,650
First Oppa, living expenses.

106
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,090
Huh?

107
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,290
Oh, okay.

108
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,260
Then I understand you're going to pay.

109
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,070
Hyung, why's she like that?

110
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,260
Have you been fine overnight?

111
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,120
How about you?

112
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,700
Me? Not really.

113
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,970
Me, neither.

114
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,320
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,940
I didn't want to add any more worry to you.

116
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,780
Also, I was okay because Park Hyeon Soo was by my side.

117
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,540
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,690
Why are you sorry?

119
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,920
I didn't know anything because I was only worried about myself.

120
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,720
You're crazy right? If you're going to say that, don't talk to me.

121
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,890
I'm really the worst friend.

122
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,210
Don't be silly. You're my one and only friend.

123
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,880
Even if someone gives me a hundred truckloads of people, I'll never trade them for you.

124
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,070
Me neither. Even if they give me a thousand truckloads of people.

125
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,300
Ten thousand truckloads!

126
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,080
- A hundred thousand truckloads! 
 - A million truckloads!

127
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,380
- A million truck loads? 
 - Right.

128
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,290
My friend!

129
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,290
Forget it. What would I say to a person like that?

130
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,350
You were here?

131
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,920
Were you looking for me?

132
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,780
- Do you need help? 
 - What?

133
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,850
The pain patch.

134
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,320
No, that's okay.

135
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,860
I don't have any ulterior motives in front of injured people.

136
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,250
No, that's not why...

137
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,140
Tell me where it hurts.

138
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,060
Here?

139
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,470
Here?

140
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,290
If not...  Here?

141
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,060
Yes, over there.

142
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,290
Thank you.

143
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,790
Did you sleep wrong?

144
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,760
Why are you in pain?

145
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,050
I punched someone for the first time.

146
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,310
You must've cried a lot.

147
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,760
No. I just wore these to look cool.

148
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,380
Thank you.

149
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,480
Aren't you curious? If Kang Woo is okay?

150
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,090
Even if I'm curious, I don't think I should ask you.

151
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,410
Are you being considerate of me?

152
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,630
I like that.

153
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,090
Like? As if.

154
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,040
Health Teacher, I've been indebted to you all this time, and been thankful.

155
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,530
You're drawing a line.

156
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,300
Don't draw a line with me because of Kang Woo.

157
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,450
I ask of you.

158
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,500
Hold on.

159
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,120
What kind of house...

160
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,650
Thank you for your home visit consultation.

161
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,850
Your welcome since you pay double for it.  Why did you ask me to come to your house?

162
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,890
I'm not in the right condition to go outside.

163
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,650
Oh my!

164
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,090
If you show so obviously what you're looking at, it's very unpleasant since I'm a human.

165
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,860
Sorry.

166
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,310
I just found it amazing that such a handsome face could become like that.

167
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,520
Why doesn't she love me?

168
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,290
Yeah, why not?

169
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,600
By any chance, did she see this house?

170
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,670
Yes. She saw it thoroughly and left.

171
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,420
She saw it and still doesn't like you?

172
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,890
What a unique person.

173
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,100
What can I do to make her love me?

174
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,300
What exactly do I need to do to gain her love?

175
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,570
Excuse me, but didn't you give up?

176
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,460
Me? Who? Joo Seo Yeon?

177
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,690
If you've hit rock bottom, it should be enough to give up.

178
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,670
Rock bottom exists to make someone hit and get back up.

179
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,500
Crazy! That punk must be crazy!

180
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,330
Psycho...

181
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,140
I'm going crazy.

182
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,850
If I get caught doing this I will really be screwed.

183
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,700
 Understanding of Human Psychology

184
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:23,120
 Arthur Kim Dong Gu

185
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,490
Is it because I got stressed out?  I'm really craving some sweets.

186
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,090
What are you doing?

187
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,330
It's raining.

188
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,050
- What? 
 - It's raining in my heart.

189
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,410
Do you have to make that kind of face?

190
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,440
Should I quit?

191
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,100
He is much worse than Lee Kang Woo.

192
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,810
Mom!

193
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,580
What?

194
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,170
Yes, Doctor Choi.  I'm counting on you.

195
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,930
Yes.

196
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,450
What's your problem? Who are you to transfer my mom to another hospital?

197
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,020
They are the best in Korea, especially in the area of gastric cancer.

198
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,960
Why does it matter to you whether they are or not, you punk?

199
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,770
Are you asking because you don't know? Why do you think I'm doing this?

200
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,330
Even if I have a lot of money and a wide circle of acquaintance, it's hard to take care of someone that I met the first time.

201
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,730
It's because it's you. It's your mother.

202
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,180
Seriously...

203
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,880
I know you don't like me being like this but—

204
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,130
Thank you.

205
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,670
I'm going now.

206
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,050
That cute shorty is creating chaos in me.

207
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,350
Right now, what are you asking me to do?

208
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,120
Spy on Lee Kang Woo.

209
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,020
This is the personal information of the woman Lee Kang Woo dates.

210
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,710
Try to find out quietly what kind of person she is without looking at which family or something like that.

211
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,960
Exactly. So why?

212
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
If I do it myself and get caught, I can't win with your mother verbally.

213
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:12,450
Your mother is absolutely against her but I think if we make Kang Woo part with her, something really bad will happen to him.

214
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,090
Then you'll support the two of them working out well?

215
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,550
As long as she has a good heart,  I would.

216
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,850
You mean you're okay as long as anyone has a good heart, right?

217
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,100
Besides Kang Woo, me as well, right?

218
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,800
Hey, your case is different.

219
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,330
For your partner, I'll choose the best of the best.  If not the best, I'll never approve!

220
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,710
How can you approve of Kang Woo but not me?

221
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,120
That's how your dad feels.

222
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,900
Anyway, take care of this matter.

223
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,710

224

225
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,250
She really didn't contact me.

226
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,290
♬  I've made mistakes I'll probably  ♬

227
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,760
Lee Kang Hee cuts off me with one stroke of the sword.

228
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,660
Assistant Manager. Isn't that your little sister?

229
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,250
♬  'Cause babe, I'd be lying if I tried to say that I'm a perfect man  ♬

233
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,170
What the—  She really just left?
 ♬  Honestly, I lose my temper when I get no credit for trying to change  ♬

234
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,110
♬  Honestly, I lose my temper when I get no credit for trying to change  ♬

235
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,310
There's no way. 
 ♬  Honestly, I lose my temper when I get no credit for trying to change  ♬

236
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,020

238
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,700
♬  Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet  ♬

239
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,770
Yes, Mother-in-law.

240
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,570
I've been distraught because of Kang Woo these days so I came out to shop for a bit.

241
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,180
Do you need anything?

242
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,680
Mother-in-law! I'll call you back.

243
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,960
Let go. Let me go!

244
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,670
Thank yo—  Omo!

245
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,440
Joo Seo Yeon!

246
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,880
Right? It's you, Joo Seo Yeon!

247
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,140
Hello!

248
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,870
Goodbye!

249
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,360
Where are you going? Joo Seo Yeon!

250
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,040
Where are you going? Joo Seo Yeon!

251
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,100
Well, I heard she used to be a member of the track team...

252
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,450
Look at her strength.

253
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,160
It's an ointment.

254
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,580
-  You caused the source of the problem but now you try to help? 
 - Yeah.

255
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,630
Why are you here again?

256
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,730
To keep an eye on you.

257
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,070
To see if you tell your mom that I hit you.

258
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,310
Hey, did Joo Seo Yeon look okay—

259
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,680
You're the one that pushed her away.

260
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,960
Do you have anything sweet? 
  Sugar

261
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,180
I don't care whether you scoop it into your mouth or now.

262
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,510
I should've just asked

263
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,210
if Lee Kang Woo was okay.

264
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,800
I should have just asked.

265
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,470
I wouldn't be crying like an idiot.

266
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,710
You ate all this while I went to the bathroom?

267
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,490
Moreover, with alcohol?

268
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,960
I tried it, and it was really good!

269
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,640
Hyung, you've never eaten sweet things before, have you?

270
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,160
Yeah, Joo Seo Yeon hates it if I'm fat.

271
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,850
What?

272
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,700
Hey Lee Min Hyuk, wake up.

273
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,050
It's the weekend, I don't go to work.

274
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,380
It's not that, wake up! We're in trouble.

275
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,000
Ugh, what!

276
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,110
You really don't do exercise?  But how come you're lifting better than me?

277
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,530
I was born with it.

278
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,360
Why am I doing this?

279
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,350
You eat too many sweets.

280
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,380
- Do you want to have diabetes at your age? 
 - Who is talking about whose story?

281
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Why are you like this all of a sudden?  When did you care about my health?

282
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,430
What are you doing?

283
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,420
I need something to care about.

284
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,340
If I don't pay attention to something else, I'm going to go crazy.

285
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,190
How did I get involved in this when I had my own problem?

286
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,230
What, what. This one?

287
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,780
Will I do this?  No.

288
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,810
Or this one? Like this?

289
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,470
I'll teach you.

290
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,840
Here, hold it like this. One.

291
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,370
One, two

292
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,640
- Two. 
 - One.

293
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,090
Are you happy now?

294
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,600
Two.

295
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,780
Now, repeat.

296
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,120
I told you he's just a friend, Mom. We went to middle school together.

297
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,580
Stop!  I'm hanging up.

298
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,640
Hey, you should have let me talk to her too.

299
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,300
For what? She'll just be annoying and ask about Park Hyeon Soo.

300
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,660
She sounded really happy.

301
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,870
Yeah well, she's excited that she's being treated so well at a big hospital.

302
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,430
That's a relief that there was nothing bad.

303
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,790
She ate very spicy chicken so much until she was getting an ulcer on the day before her regular check-up.

304
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,820
That's how she got recommended to get a complete medical examination.

305
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,740
My mom is getting silly anyhow.

306
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:09,030
You know, I think Park Hyeon Soo is a good guy.

307
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,970
Well, he's not the worst.

308
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,780
If your heart goes to him, don't lose him.

309
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,690
It's upsetting.  Your pretty thin smile.

310
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,090
No, I'm really okay now.

311
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,080
This won't do.

312
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,180
Are we going somewhere?

313
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, wear this.

314
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,380
- Me? 
 - We're going to lighten the mood.

315
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,970
What? Forget it.

316
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,580
Wear it. Get up. You're not getting up?

317
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,640
I'll just—  I'll just—

318
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,810
I'm okay.

319
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,760
♬  Pretty woman, walking down the street  ♬

320
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,690
♬  Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet  ♬

321
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,750
How do you go around wearing this stuff?

322
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,030
That's my question.  How do you go around wearing  this  stuff?

323
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,200
Nothing sticks to my body so I feel like I'm naked.

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,890

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,720
Shot, shot, shot.

338
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,470
I want to go. I want to go home.

339
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,570
Okay, let's go.

340
