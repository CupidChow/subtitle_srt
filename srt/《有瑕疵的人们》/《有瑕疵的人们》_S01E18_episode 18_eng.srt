00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,730
 Episode 18

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,780
Do you really have to take that position?

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,850
I think I must be the offspring of my father and mother.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,240
I think this position is the closest one that I can follow in their footsteps.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,430
You can do it even if you're in a better or higher position.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,380
Rather, it'll be even easier to do if you are.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,640
I want to start slowly from that position.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,620
Alright, if that's what you really want.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,510
Thank you, Grandma.  I'll do my best.

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,100
Startling!

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Ah, it's startling.  I thought you were Kang Hee.

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,880
What brings you here?

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,670
Honey. I think Min Hyeok wants to work at the company.

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,640
Min Hyuk? Well, he's more than qualified to do so.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,120
Will it be okay?

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,040
- What about? 
 - I mean, he is very smart.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,750
Our Kang Woo.

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,160
- Kang Woo? 
 - Kang Hee is good enough to take care of herself so I don't worry.

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,450
For Kang Woo, he keeps doing useless stuff.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,720
At this rate, I'm afraid he would fall out of favor with Mother-in-law.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,340
I heard Kang Woo wants to do a different thing.  Then it doesn't matter, don't you think so?

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,380
You really.  He is just saying that.  What else can he do?

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,260
We should let him get married quickly and settled in the company.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,630
Does he listen to us easily even if he marries?

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,680
Making him marry is just the problem.  If someone wants to marry him,

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,590
I'll treat her heavenly.

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,970
Why on earth doesn't Min Hyeok want to do such a good job as doctor?

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,190
Others fret about not being able to be a doctor.

29
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,750
Do you know something about it?

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,610
Honey!

31
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,440
Huh? I'm sorry.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,580
Let's think about it.  Right, right,  thinking.

33
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,120
Right now, you're thinking of what we would eat for dinner, aren't you?

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,570
How did you know?

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,130
Honey, the potato and pork stew restaurant just opened right in front of our building.

36
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,190
The potato... really...  I think it's from Gangwon-do.

37
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,860
- It's a killer. 
 - Really.

38
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,830
Honey?  Darling?

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,840
Honey?

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,350
Wait!  My sweet and sour Ms. Oh Mi Ja!

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,520
Honey!

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,020
If you work too hard, I'll be the one that would be weird.

43
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,810
- What? 
 - What are you doing?

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,080
Did you finish solving it all?

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,780
Let's take it easy for studying.  We just finished the midterms.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,630
I can see your potential.

47
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,960
Not everyone can move up by 100 ranks.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,120
- So— 
 - Tutor Ho Dol, don't you have a girlfriend?

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,970
Huh?  I don't have one.

50
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,120
Why not?  If you are a student of Hankuk University, aren't you very popular?

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,780
Just... I don't have one.

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,430
So strange.

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,320
Surprisingly, a lot of women like a studyholic types like Tutor Ho Dol.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,140
Right?

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,630
Maybe, is it like that you are very popular but you don't realize it?

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,790
There is a very nice noona among my friends' noonas.  Would you like to see her?

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,730
N-No, I'm fine.

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,850
Wait, wait!

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,940
- What is this?
 - Hey.

60
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,860
Shut your mouth and focus on your study without disturbing Joo Hee's study.

61
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,990
Geez, I brought myself up by 100 ranks.

62
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,450
Well, I have a friend now, Hyung-nim.

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,480
Hyung-nim?

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,160
Then Master?

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,280
I really didn't have any friend.

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,530
He is a very cool and nice friend.

67
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,130
So?

68
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,040
That is...

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,480
Do you want to chitchat with me?

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,300
I just ...

71
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,110
 The moment you want to give up is the moment you start over.

72
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,610
It's hard to see you.

73
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,820
You stay here all the time except your classes, right?

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,460
I think this is the first time to be here.

75
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,660
Yes, it's your first time.  You're not interested in the track team.

76
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,590
- Let's change everything here. 
 - What?

77
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,370
What do you need?  Which one should I change first?

78
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,640
No, don't do that.

79
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,400
Your support is already more than enough.  Don't touch this place uselessly.  This place is good enough, as it is.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,930
I'm a chief director.

81
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,530
Even if you reject it, I can do whatever I want to.

82
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,670
I know that you're a chief director.  And the track team and I are at the mercy of your one word.

83
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,690
I know it very well.

84
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,290
Do you want me to drive for you?  Let's go.

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,130
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,050
I didn't know what the track team meant to you until now.

87
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,870
If I had known it, I would not have said thoughtlessly that I would get rid of the track team or something else.

88
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,330
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,330
I didn't know about your parents' accident.

90
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,370
I felt resentment at you without knowing anything on the day.

91
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,230
 I have something to tell you.  What is your address? I'll be there right now.

92
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,420
"Why isn't she here?"

93
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,980
"She even asked my address because she has something to tell me.  Why isn't she here?"

94
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,370
"Am I just a joke?"  I had thoughts like that.

95
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,270
I looked stupid.

96
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,720
Did I say that?

97
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm sorry.  I can't remember anything.

98
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:59,070
I don't remember the day my parents got in an accident, that one day.

99
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,780
When I woke up, I was in the hospital.

100
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,640
According to my brothers, I lost consciousness because of shock.

101
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,760
I was hospitalized for a month.

102
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,890
I didn't know either.

103
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,360
What on earth do I know?

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,050
I'm so pathetic.

105
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,110
It's so natural that you didn't know anything.

106
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,320
When I was discharged, I found out you went abroad to study.

107
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,130
During staying at the hospital for a month, I thought about

108
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,720
why this happened to my parents of all people...

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,650
 There are so many bad people but why this happened to my nice parents of all people?

110
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,920
 No matter how hard I thought about, I had only one conclusion.

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,620
Their minds and their face looks were so beautiful

112
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,730
that they were taken away too soon and too hard like that.

113
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,830
I think that was how I started

114
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,730
having a reluctance to let handsome people stay next to me,

115
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,430
using my brothers as excuses.

116
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:35,240
 There must be something else stuck in her, deeper inside. It's so deep that she doesn't even know where it is.

117
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,580
 So you can't do anything with that state.

118
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,350
It's not I don't like you but I'm just scared.

119
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,580
So—

120
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,450
You know I'm very mean, right?  And also very selfish.

121
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,930
Even if something bad happens to me, there must be several dozens of reasons there,

122
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,260
not because of my face.

123
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,820
So don't get scared in advance even before we start it.

124
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,420
Please.

125
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,430
 Please save us!

126
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,660
 Because of my parents' accident, I was imaging it by myself and tormented by it so I even dream about it.

127
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,550
 I was running endlessly then I got an accident as like it really happened to me.

128
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,820
 That accident is not my past.

129
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,150
 It's still going on now.

130
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,420
You see...

131
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,800
Is there a psychological state that

132
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,100
someone feels like the shocking incident that she heard in the past actually happened to her?

133
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,750
Also having dreams as if they were on the scene.

134
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,690
That is an identification?

135
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,940
Synchronization?

136
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,060
Wait a moment.

137
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,690
 Nutrition Pregnancy and Congenital Heart Disease

138
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,780
There was a thesis about such a symptom in this book.

139
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,160
Does that have something to do with the heart?

140
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,780
What?

141
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,520
Well, you're looking at a book that deals with heart diseases.

142
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,100
 Nutrition Pregnancy and Congenital Heart Disease

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,730
Wait, you said that you lived in the states, right?

144
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,370
So you can read English well.

145
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,280
What?

146
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,570
The heart is a body part that controls all the parts of a human.

147
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,960
It is very closely related to the brain.

148
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,290
So it very much affects the psychological state—

149
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,510
Are you okay?

150
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,690
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm not feeling well

152
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,290
so let's stop for today.

153
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,400
Ah, yes. Let's.

154
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,750
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

155
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm okay.

156
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,080
Alright.

157
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,250
Goodbye.

158
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,290
Seriously. Now he's even asking me for a consultation for his girlfriend.

159
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,620
I'm so dizzy.

160
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,610
Should I take her up on her offer?

161
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,540
It'll earn me money and there aren't any bad conditions.

162
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,060
What do you think, Antoinette?

163
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,920
Oppa!

164
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,030
Kim Mi Kyeong, did you come to see Seo Yoon?

165
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,260
- Seo Yoon isn't home. 
 - Kind of.

166
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,250
I heard there was a new person that moved in upstairs.

167
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,880
Well, that's how it seems.

168
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,050
How is she? Doesn't she seem suspicious?

169
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know.

170
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,890
How could you look so cool even by just standing here like this?

171
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,570
How could our Mi Kyeong speak such nice words?

172
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,330
Oppa, shall we get married?

173
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,740
- Do you have a lot of money? 
-  No.

174
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,520
Indeed, you don't have money either, do you?

175
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,350
No, I don't have money.

176
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,740
We should marry people who have a lot of money,

177
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,950
receive a lot of alimony after divorcing them, and then reconsider.

178
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,640
Yes, let's.

179
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,000
Earn a lot of money, Oppa.

180
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:34,060
Right.  Anyway, my body would get rotten after I die.  So why would I conserve my body?

181
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,800
Use it when it's still firm.

182
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,240
Lee Kang Hee?  Let's do it.

183
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,580
All of this family's members are pushovers.  That's the problem.

184
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,610
Baek Jang Mi, I will definitely uncover your identity... Oh!

185
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,420
Hey, Joo Seo—

186
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,600
Why is she acting like she's Seo Yoon?

187
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,270
She's definitely hiding something.

188
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,780
 A kind person.

189
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,660
 Do you want this?

190
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,780
Who are you?

191
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,270
Unni Mi Kyeong!

192
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,350
Unni Seo Yoon talks a lot about you, Unni Mi Kyeong.

193
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,810
You two must be really close.

194
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,070
Yes, well...

195
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,450
 Why am I eating with her right now?

196
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,630
I'm jealous. I want to be close to you two quickly.

197
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,490
Yeah. Well.

198
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,320
 It's freaking good. She must be really good at cooking.

199
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,190
 I should stop, but I can't.

200
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,170
You're back!  Wow!

201
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,510
It's no joke.

202
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,190
Did you see? It's no joke.

203
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,890
I'm more photogenic than I thought.

204
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,900
Ah, here!

205
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,000
I made a slight mistake here. You can't tell, right?

206
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,560
No, I don't notice. You really did well.

207
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,090
Where is Hyung Jeong Ho?

208
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,280
♫  Looking at my phone records, it's filled all with your numbers  ♫

209
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,630
♫  I wanted to hear your voice and talk to you  ♫

210
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,650
♫  Is there something happened?  So what did you do  ♫

211
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,080
 Hey.

212
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,220
 Someone get rid of him.

213
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,080
 I think I can debut, instead of him.

214
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,420
 He isn't a trainee as well, right?

215
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,930
 With that look?  What do you think HS Entertainment's level is?

216
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,560
 - Isn't he just an ordinary person?
- He's blocking all of the handsome people.

217
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,630
 You should just go home.

218
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,610
- Hyung! Are you in here? 
- Yeah.

219
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,180
- Do you have an upset stomach? 
 - No.

220
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,520
That's good. Here.

221
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm only buying this for you and not the other hyungs.

222
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,380
Drink it.

223
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,200
You kept saying it was wasting money to hang a door.  What makes you do it?

224
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,230
A person who I need to show my true coolness today—

225
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,140
When the customer is here, please bring Coffeelowa coffee that I saved.

226
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,040
Who on earth would be so he even asked to bring out  Coffeelowa coffee?

227
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,200
 Eat a lot.

228
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,810
Lee Kang Woo wasn't enough, so even Lee Min Hyeok?

229
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,090
She is a complete killer to Shinhwa Food's men.

230
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,530
Why isn't she coming on to me?

231
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,690
I prepared Coffeelowa coffee.

232
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,990
You have heard Coffeelowa, haven't you?

233
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,120
Poop coffee?

234
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,850
Do they say they are the western cats?  They can't even poop whenever they like to.

235
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,790
People are watching them with eyes wide open when they would poop, sadly.

236
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,450
It's really a novel reaction of you.

237
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,240
- I can drink this, right? 
 - No.

238
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,830
I pick— bought it from a bad place.

239
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,720
You said you had something to say. What is it?

240
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,690
Ah, thanks to you for helping High Seven at the time.

241
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,670
I want to express my thankful heart.

242
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,010
It's fine. I only helped out because Lee Kang Woo asked, not you.

243
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,290
What's so different between Lee Kang Woo and me?

244
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,970
Lee Kang Woo at least didn't treat me like a gold digger.

245
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,090
That—

246
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:41,430
You don't have anything to say anymore, right?  Thank you for your treatment of poop coffee.

247
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,550
Stop right there!

248
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,350
- You follow me.
- Hey!

249
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,120
Pick whatever you like. Well, whatever you want... is too much.

250
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,490
Two. Just pick two handbags.

251
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,690
What are you doing?

252
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,980
Is two not enough?

253
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,060
Fine, I can buy you at least five.

254
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,030
I asked what you were doing.

255
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,300
That's still not enough? Aren't you being too much?

256
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,050
Fine, tell me how many. How many?

257
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,570
Are you crazy? Who are you treating like a gold digger?

258
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,550
- What? 
 - Who are you to be buying me handbags?

259
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,840
I just thought you'd like it.

260
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,010
I do like it. I freaking love expensive and good things, but I have no reason to receive them from you.

261
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,660
Do you see me as a person who extorts bags from men without any reason?

262
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,500
Well, you must, seeing you treat me like this.

263
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,690
No, that's not it. I was just grateful that you helped me last time and—

264
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,730
If you're grateful for last time, you could've just bought me a meal!

265
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,160
You were better when I thought you were a janitor but you were bluffing than when you try to spend money in a crazy way.

266
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,430
It seems as if you're misunderstanding me but—

267
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,090
If you call me again, I'm going to seriously kill you!

268
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,790
All I have is money.  If money doesn't work, what should I do?

269
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,020
Teacher.

270
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,230
What are you doing?

271
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,120
There was a cat so I was petting it. It's really cute.

272
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,430
You touched it? You're saying you saw Antoinette in person?

273
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,110
An... Yes, why?

274
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,870
It is very wild so no one sees it.

275
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,060
It was docile.

276
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,940
I think you have the ability to make both people and animals feel at ease.

277
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,910
Maybe it's because even your soul is kind.

278
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,610
I'm not nice.

279
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,490
If you were not nice, I would be a devil from the fiery pit of hell.

280
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,720
But what brings you all the way over here?

281
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,330
I thought of you, Teacher Joo.

282
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,800
As expected, a kind person. Do you want to come in and eat it with me?

283
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,350
Is there anyone home?

284
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,140
No, there's no one.

285
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,080
Then, next time.

286
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,490
Why? Are you going somewhere?

287
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,120
If I stay only with you in an empty house, I'll get flustered.

288
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,500
 Left Turn Signal Only

289
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,530
 Do you want to come in?

290
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,100
 Do you want to come in and eat it with me?

291
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,160
 Is there anyone home?

292
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,600
 No, there's no one.

293
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,190
Does she not see me as a man at all?

294

Ah, wait.

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,550
You should read it first. How could you just trust me like that?

Pardon?

303

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,080
Try this on.

317
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,090
Should I?

318
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,760
♬  Despacito  ♬
♬  Slowly  ♬

319
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,380
♬  Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito  ♬
♬  I want to breathe in your neck slowly  ♬

320
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,170
♬  Deja que te diga cosas al oído  ♬
♬  Let me murmur things in your ear  ♬

321
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,110
♬  Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo  ♬
♬  So that you remember if you’re not with me  ♬

322
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,320
Put it on.

323
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,420
You should feel something when looking at a body like mine.

324
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,020
Hurry.

325
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,680
♬  I don't know what it is but I got that feeling  ♬

326
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,850
Do you know why I'm only wearing expensive and nice clothes?

327
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,700
♬  but still know that I'm good  ♬

328
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,470
Because you're rich.

329
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,570
That's true too. But everybody says inner beauty is more important than outer beauty, right?

330
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:22,390
But a human being is a visual animal.  So they judge others by looking at the outer first.

331
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,490
Particularly,  people in our field who do business.

332
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,670
♬  I like me better when I'm with you  ♬

333
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:33,380
If they see a little gap that shows you fall behind them, then they start gnawing at you and stepping on you.

334
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,020
♬  I'd stay for a long time 'cause  ♬

335
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,970
♬  I like me better when  ♬

336
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,900
Clothes are like armor to me.

337
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,020
So my bodyguard should wear the stronger armor than mine, right?

338
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,690
It suits you well. Put the rest on and come out.

339
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,770
I'm going crazy.

340
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,600
What is this? What could this be?

341
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
♬  Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain  ♬

342
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,850
♬  My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain  ♬

343
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,650
♬  She need something to change, need to take off the edge  ♬

344
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,020
Don't look at me like that. I just came here as a customer.

345
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,390
♬  And don't tell me to shut up  ♬

346
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,900
♬  When you know you talk too much  ♬

347
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,560
What?

348
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,180
♬  But you don't got shit to say  ♬

349
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,860
I'll order a little later. My friend is coming.

350
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,990
♬  I want you out of my bedroom tonight   ♬

351
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,990
♬  There's no way I can save you  ♬

352
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,120
♬  'Cause I need to be saved, too  ♬

353
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,710
 Flowby

354
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,710
This is the right place.

355
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,220
Why did he tell me to come here?

356
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,430
It was good I didn't delete it.

357
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,790
Only until we take a photo on a real date.

358
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,290
 But why don't you have any women's designs?

359
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,290
 You used to draw a lot of women's clothes in the past.

360
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,780
It's freaking good.

361
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,970
How did the health teacher know to buy this?

362
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,300
Is it good?

363
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,290
Yes, it's really good.

364
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,240
What?

365
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,620
- I don't feel anything. 
 - Hey.

366
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,190
You ate all of this by yourself and you're telling me you don't feel anything? Have a conscience.

367
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,840
- I have no feelings. 
- What?

368
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,530
I have no feelings.

369
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,440
About what?

370
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,680
What brings you here? You even bought alcohol.

371
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,620
I like Teacher Joo Seo Yoon.

372
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,510
I came here to tell you that.

373
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,760
I heard something I didn't need to hear.

374
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,490
And you said something you didn't need to say.

375
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,240
About what? What feelings?

376
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,760
When I kissed Lee Kang Woo,

377
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,230
I felt nothing.

378
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:02,700

379
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,080
♫  I just happened to meet you by chance and I fell in love with you  ♫

380
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:18,900
♫  I didn't realize that day by day, time was passing  ♫

381
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,420
♫  But did you get tired of me or did I do something wrong?  ♫

382
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,780
 Love with Flaws  
 ♫  But did you get tired of me or did I do something wrong?  ♫

383
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,710
 A lack of skills. He's someone who seriously can't kiss.

384
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,630
 - What do you want me to do? 
 - Actual kiss is important.

385
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,360
 What on Earth is he doing?

386
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,900
 What kind of a relationship do you have with my Kang Woo?

387
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,320
 Probably, he thinks he would marry her.

388
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,530
 Please let it go this once.

389
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,240
 You!  Did you use your power?

390
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,520
 Lee Kang Woo was fired as the Chief Director?

391
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,940
 Chief Director Lee Min Hyeok.

392
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,120
 You told me to do what I wanted to do.

393
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,640
 Why did you ask to meet me here?

394
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,230
 I knew from the first glance.

395
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,590
 I'm going to tell the teacher that you are acting weird.

396
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,670
 On the day of mom and dad's accident, wasn't I home?

397
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,820
 Do I need to tell her?

398
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,640
 If she knows, she'll die.
