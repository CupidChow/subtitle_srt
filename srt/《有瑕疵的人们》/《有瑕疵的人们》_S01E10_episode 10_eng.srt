 Episode Ten

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,550
I have a lot of thoughts.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,020
- What kind? 
 - Let's finish up what we didn't finish talking about last time.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,730
Lov...

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,670
My feelings about Joo Seo Yeon.

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,390
Lov—

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,470
Those feelings–is there they could be less vague and more concrete?

8
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,330
I'm not sure. Those feelings are complicated and difficult.

9
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,230
You miss her when you don't see her. You want to check whether she's hurt or not.

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,770
You're curious about who she's meeting.

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,040
Lov— No!

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,140
Do you know another name for it?

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,990
- Jealousy. 
 - Jealousy?

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,280
Do you feel frustrated and get angry when she's with another man?

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
Then it's 100% jealousy.

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,570
You're saying that my heart is frustrated and angry...

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,600

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,020
Did you get your mole taken out?

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,410
You have a mole under your eye but you don't have one.

20
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,350
Yes, I did.

21
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,580
It's better that way.

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,410
 You miss her when you don't see her.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
 I miss her when I don't see her.

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,140
 But I don't miss her to that extent.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,340
 I haven't seen Joo Seo Yeon for 15 hours, 8 minutes and 23 seconds and I'm fine.

26
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,630
 I've been counting how many hours,  minutes, and seconds?

27
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,390
Me?!

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,890
 What is she doing right now?

29
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,940
 She didn't go home from work yet, so she couldn't be seeing another man.

30
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,870
 Did she get hurt when I threw her?

31
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,880
 You're curious about

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,910
 whether or not she's hurt or seeing someone else.

33
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,290
 ♫ When the rain falls and music flows ♫   
 (T/N: "Like Rain Like Music" by Kim Hyun Sik)

34
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:10,030
I'm not curious! I'm not curious! About Joo Seo Yeon!

35
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,670
No!

36
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,690
Move!  Move aside!

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,480
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

38
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,970
Get on my back.

39
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,520
 School Infirmary

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,400
Teacher! Teacher!

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,170
- Teacher Joo!  
 - It's an emergency.

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,030
How is it?

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,940
It was hurting a lot before, but it's okay now.

44
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,260
Maybe your muscles were in shock.

45
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,700
He's okay?

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,270
Yes, he's fine.

47
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,340
Don't use your knees too much in the next few days.

48
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,460
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

49
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,720
Thank you.

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,410
Ah, that stings!

51
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,260
I'm okay, though.

52
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,380
Not yet. Or it might get infected.

53
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,830
Teacher Joo, you're still throwing yourself for the students' matter.

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,950
I'm talking about when I first came here,

55
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,160
I came here to look around the school because I heard the last Health Teacher was emigrating.

56
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,080
Honestly, I wasn't that interested in working at a school.

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,530
 Move out of the way!  Move!

58
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,220
It wasn't like she hurt her leg like the boy today.

59
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,120
She just had a double nosebleed from getting hit by a basketball.

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,130
You looked so cool.

61
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,380
Was that so?

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,860
Well, even if their bodies have grown, they're still kids at heart.

63
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,620
It's scary for adults too when they get hurt. How would it be for kids?

64
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,040
You're a good person, Teacher Joo.

65
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,030
I will just do it myself—

66
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,590
You said yourself that it's scary for adults too when they get hurt.  It's my job so I'm not scared.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,380
 When that person is with another man, your heart feels frustrated.

68
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,370
Knock! Knock!  Chief Director Lee!

69
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,140
When I looked outside, there was your car.  I thought it was odd.

70
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,810
How could you come to work without notifying us!

71
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,810
You should've come after notifying us.

72
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,500
- It makes me a little sad! 
 - Why!

73
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,550
Did I come when I shouldn't have?

74
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,890
What were you going to do without me here?!

75
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,200
I came to my office!

76
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,060
There are so many things to do!

77
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,840
Please leave. I said to leave!

78
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,040
 You don't know why, but... ah!

79
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,050
 You get angry?

80
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,740
 Then, it's 100%.

81
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,860
♫  Hey boy!  ♫

82
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,580

83
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,970

103
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,600
 Hey! Stop saying crazy things and go poop!

104
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,990
 You're... ugly

105
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,400
 and fat, so I don't like you!

106
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,030
What's this?

107
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,770

108
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,180
Hello.

109
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,480
 Show some manners when you pay a tip to a valet.

110
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,380
 Don't you know even a trivial behavior shows your character?

111
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,100
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

112
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,290
What's this?

113
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,210
What can this be?

114
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,410
Ah, my car!

115
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,660
How much is it? I'll compensate for it.

116
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,630
No, that's okay.

117
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,950
I have some fault as well.

118
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,990
You don't need to compensate because both of us are at fault.

119
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,470
- But still, I will— 
 - No, it's okay.

120
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,980
Let's meet again, Lee Kang Hee.

121
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,580
What's going on? This time, is she your target this time?

122
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,060
You told the others, didn't you?

123
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,970
Of course!  I told them to call you if that car shows up.

124
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,010
Good job!

125
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,690
Hyung! I can't see you.   Where are you, Hyung?

126
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,730
Do you know what M.L.D.W.N is?

127
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,650
That kind of man that loses in the day and wins in the night.

128
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,430
By day, he's always bending over for his girlfriend, doing everything she asks for.

129
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,440
But by night, he's a total beast—

130
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,010
Girls that ooze charisma like her,

131
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,400
like the type of men who are M.L.D.W.N.

132
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,550
You're here early.

133
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,540
What are you doing?

134
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,640
Oh, I saw a cat over here.  Oh gosh!

135
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,610
The cat is very fierce.

136
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,230
What about Seo Yeon?

137
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,550
She went to your bar to give you medicine and porridge because you seemed sick.  Didn't you see her?

138
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,990
♫  If I should call you up, invest a dime   
   And you say you belong to me and ease my mind  ♫

139
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,720
♫  Imagine how the world could be so very fine  ♫

140
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,410
♫  So happy together  ♫

141
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,190
Lee Kang Woo, have some confidence. You aren't who were you before.

142
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,900
Lee Kang Woo, have some confidence. You aren't who were you before.
 ♫  I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life  ♫

143
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,260

 ♫  I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life  ♫

144

147
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,260
What are you doing here?

148
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,290
Do you even know where you are?

149
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,060
What are you talking about? Is this place where you have to be famous like Park Hyeon Soo to get in?

150
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm famous too! What's wrong with you?

151
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,430
This is going to add a lot more rumors.

152
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,350
I don't know either.  Who cares?

153
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,730
Okay, let's have a drink for the first time in a while.

154
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,440
Yeah, Oldest Oppa?

155
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,030
What? The Second Oppa came home?

156
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,570
Okay, I got it.

157
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,260
I came here for nothing.

158
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,870
♫  I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life  ♫

159
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,340
♫  I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life  ♫

160
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,020
♫  When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life  ♫

161
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,100
♫  ♫  When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life  ♫

162
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,630
They really look good together,

163
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,770
those two people.

164
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,020
Lee Kang Woo... Fighting.

165
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,520
Oh, you're here?

166
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,000
Why'd you come all the way to the bar?

167
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,520
Where's the medicine?

168
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,570
Why haven't you said anything?

169
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,660
You! What are you?

170
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,850
I mean– I—

171
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,950
Oh! You're here early today, Second Older Brother.

172
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,120
Huh? You don't have to do the dishes. Seo Yeon will come and do them later, Tutor.

173
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,890
It's okay. Well, she even gave me dinner so...

174
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,230
I f-finished it. See you later!

175
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,910
Goodbye!

176
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,100
Who's that?

177
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,900
- My tutor! 
 - What?

178
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,610
He's a student from Hanguk University, but he's super good at teaching.

179
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,140
Wait. I'll be first in the class!

180
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,190
Wait. Does that mean I'll really be first? Ah, really.

181
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,660
 I'm only saying this because you seem like a younger brother to me, but you don't fit in here.

182
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,610
 I'm sure you could tell just by looking.

183
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,850
He probably didn't remember, right? I really need this job.

184
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,640
Oh, he's new.

185
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,580
How did you get into that house?

186
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,670
It's making me jealous.

187
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,150
 Joo Seo Yeon

188
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,540
Stay still!

189
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
Lee Kang Woo is having a hard time too, right?

190
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,070
Hey, is this silk?

191
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,780
The fabric is so good.

192
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,360
Who said you could wear it?

193
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,700
You have a lot in your closet.

194
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,920
Do you live here?

195
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,530
I'm going to bury myself in the company.

196
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,670
Then you should've gone there. Why did you come here?

197
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,210
What is this? It looks like elephant poop.

198
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,390
Don't be like that and start dating a girl.

199
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,260
Don't get attached to something weird like that.

200
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,990
What type of man do girls like?

201
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,190
What?

202
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,530
Girls... What do they like?

203
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,180
Girls?

204
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,660
Stuff like that.

205
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,670
Do they like things like that? Girls do?

206
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,600
Of course, they're going to die for that.

207
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,790
A rich guy is bragging his wealth so obviously.

208
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,560
Good job today! There isn't much time left until the competition so make sure to stay in good shape.

209
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,040
Sinhwa High's Track Team!

210
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,480
Let's go, let's go, fighting!

211
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,830
Oh?  Chief Director is over there.

212
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,080
Thank you!

213
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,300
You must really like it

214
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,130
The track team's work.

215
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,430
Yeah, if it wasn't for track, I don't think I would have made it.

216
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,060
Lee Kang Woo, do you want a secret method for being super good at track?

217
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,420
Say that the finish line is all the way over there.

218
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,200
At the starting line, you have to imagine that there's something that you really really want,

219
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,730
whether it's an object, a person, or a circumstance.

220
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,000
If you think about that and run like crazy, then it's game over!

221
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,680
You're laughing?

222
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,600
I won the silver medal at the national athletic meet with this method.

223
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,430
Okay. You did well.

224
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,120
Hey, Lee Kang Woo. You should just run as well.

225
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,740
Don't think about anything else but look at the finish line and think about what you want.

226
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:09,490
♫  When I quietly walk behind you  ♫

227
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:16,820
♫  I can't lift my head but only I look at your shadow  ♫

228
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,150
♫  If I look at the back of you, who are walking ahead  ♫

229
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:30,300
♫  Maybe I'll be in tears  ♫

230
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:40,100
♫  I want to hold your hand swinging in step  ♫

231
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,500
♫  I can't do it  ♫

232
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,500
♫  I try to muster my courage  ♫

233
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:58,290
♫  It's too hard for me  ♫

234
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,430
Hello?

235
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,890
What are you doing?

236
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:16,150
I'm going to run, just like you said,

237
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,780
just looking at one thing.

238
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,100
 I have something to tell you. Come here by 10 PM.

239
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,180
I'm sure this is the right place.

240
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,570
Lee Kang Woo. Lee Kang Woo!

241
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,050
 Market Hall

242
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,060
What's all of this?

243
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,270
Do you like it?

244
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,450
I could have just rented an entire amusement park but more than an amusement park,

245
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,920
I thought you would like this.

246
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,740
Why? What is it?

247
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,560
To give this to me?

248
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,400
No. For the track team.

249
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,880
It's for the students.

250
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,580
You can say...this is a kind of the chief director's sponsorship.

251
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,550
The track team?

252
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,410
This is for my kids?

253
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,730
This is really cute!

254
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,790
But why, all of the sudden?`

255
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,970
It's a bribe for asking you to consider me in a good way.

256
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,590
What?

257
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,180
I think it started a long time ago.

258
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,600
Like an idiot, I only realized it now

259
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,040
I  didn't need another girl for a long time...

260
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,930
 What? You don't need a girl?

261
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,940
 Right... Did he find out that I know?

262
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,770
 Park Hyeon See said not to get caught.

263
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,490
...besides you.

264
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,110
I'd like it if... you'd stay by my side.

265
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,040
Joo Seo Yeon.

266
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,980
Me?

267
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,970
Yeah. You.

268
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,080
When I'm next to you, I always embarrass and humiliate myself.

269
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:28,040
But I think I can only be myself when you're by my side.

270
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,310
So, Joo Seo Yeon...

271
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,240
Will you be by my side?

272
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,530
 Oh, you need a shield.

273
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,110
 So that you don't have to go on blind dates, and so you have an excuse to your family.

274
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,560
What do you think?

275
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,470
Does Park Hyeon Soo know you're doing this?

276
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,790
Park Hyeon Soo?

277
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,070
I feel like it's not right for me to do this when there is Park Hyeon Soo.

278
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,070
By any chance, do you have...

279
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,950
 feelings for Park Hyeon Soo?

280
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,640
Yes.

281
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,080
I'm sorry, but I already...

282
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,510
 heard everything about you and Park Hyeon Soo from him.

283
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,570
Since when?

284
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,810
 You liked  Park Hyeon Soo?

285
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,420
 Since when did I... know?

286
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,210
The truth is, I realized it after seeing...

287
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,600
 you two together, your relationship...

288
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
From the very beginning, I...

289
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,610
 had no chance after all.

290
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,140
Yeah. From the beginning, you...

291
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,200
 had Park Hyeon Soo.

292
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,670
Hey! What are you doing here at this time?

293
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,010
Why are you being like this?

294
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,680
You damn bastard!

295
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,560
You cheap bastard!

296
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,360
Are you crazy?

297
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,310
You crazy bastard!

298
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,080
It's insane!

299
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,230
Stop!

300
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,880
Why, why, why? These pajamas!

301
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,920
Are you hitting me because I took some pajamas, you jerk?

302
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Joo Seo Yeon... Joo Seo Yeon said she likes you!

303
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,110
What is this nonsense? We never had any contact! Why would she?

304
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,750
I don't know!

305
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,350
O-o-okay, let's just say she likes me.

306
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,430
Does that give you a reason to do this to me?!

307
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,370
Lee Kang Woo...

308
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,920
D-d-do you r-r-really—?

309
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,750
Wait a minute. What happened here?

310
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:46,330
J-Joo Seo Yeon, thinking that I had that kind of r-relationship with Lee Kang Woo, said she likes me?

311
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,210
Isn't she crazy?

312
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,010
Lee Kang Woo!

313
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,970
 Why are they being like this again?

314
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,710
I thought the track team issues were settled.

315
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,350
 You're ugly and fat, so I don't like you!

316
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,220
 Will you stay by my side?

317
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,330
 I think I can only be myself when you're by my side.

318
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,600
 I feel like it's not right for me to do this when there is Park Hyeon Soo

319
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,390
 By any chance, do you...

320
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,240
 I'm sorry, but with Park Hyeon soo, I already...

321
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,710
But... then and now he didn't like me for real.

322
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,030
Why did he have that facial expression?

323
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,150
He's making a person feel concerned!

324
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,420
Who is it?

325
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:33,230
Lee Kang Woo, I also feel like I could do it.

326
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,570
 Your fake girlfriend.

327
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:42,150
I'm accepting... what you said.

328
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,210
What...

329
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:48,910
You said there's no one aside from me. You said that I have to be by your side for you to be who you really are.

330
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,770
I understand how desperate your heart must be.

331
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,590
Let's do it.

332
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,990
What about Park Hyeon Soo?

333
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,570
Forget it. He'll understand.

334
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,060
Pride.

335
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,310
My pride is so hurt.

336
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,990
That's right, that could happen.

337
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,400
Let's try and if it really doesn't work then we can stop—

338
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,320
I feel like I could die...

339
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,470
because I like it so much.

340
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,500
I'll do well.

341
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,480
Okay, well. Me too.

342
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:26,590

343
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,350
♫  I just happened to meet you by chance and I fell in love with you  ♫

344
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,090
 Love With Flaws

345
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,410
 What are you going to do with Lee Kang Woo?

346
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,990
 - Are you her guy friend or something? 
 - Boyfriend!

347
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,180
 - What? 
- What?

348
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,380
 He's definitely not your style.

349
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,480
 You're not dating him for real, right?

350
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,580
 Did you just say that Lee Kang Woo and Park Hyeon Soo weren't dating?

351
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,960
 Park Hyeon Soo!

352
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,030
 I found out that you two were planning this to screw me.

353
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,250
 Is that all you saw me as?

354
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,250
 You don't know why Teacher Joo got this drunk?

355
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,240
 No way,  do you like Joo Seo Yeon... ?

356
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,320
 Ask it.

357
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,600
♫  Take responsibility for my life that was ruined like that  ♫
