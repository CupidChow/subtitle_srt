 Episode 19 
 What feelings? What do you mean?

2
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,070
When I kissed Lee Kang Woo, I didn't feel anything.

3
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,790
What?

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,220
I think something is wrong with me.

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,840
 I like Teacher Joo Seo Yeon. 

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,180
I came here to tell you that.

7
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,460
I heard something I didn't need to hear.

8
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,090
And you said something you didn't need to say.

9
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,180
I thought I should.  You probably already knew it.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you going to do?  Joo Seo Yeon already started leaning toward me.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,190
Are you confident?

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah.

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,580
Then okay.

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,340
Didn't you buy them to give to me?

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,660
I did.  But thinking about it, why should I, when I don't like you?

16
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,120
It's true you worry about Lee Kang Woo and keep thinking of him, right?

17
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,400
When he said he liked you, did this place get tickled?

18
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,700
It seemed like that.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
Then why didn't you feel anything?

20
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,780
What are you doing?

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,300
I'm checking to see if you could be the kind in Oppa Won Seok's league but you didn't realize it yet.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,260
- No, it's not like that. 
 - Are you sure?

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,980
Then only one reason left.  Lee Kang Woo is really a bad kisser.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,440
What?

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,530
I mean he's an awfully bad kisser.

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,500
A man with no skills. Isn't that it?

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,020
I don't know.

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,170
I don't think I'm particularly good either.

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,560
True. Lee Kang Woo and you–two dunces met together so I can imagine.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,310
How should it feel?

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,220
How can I explain this?

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,480
A flame that is traveling from toes, through all the body, to the end of the head, while it is burning...

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
- Let's go. 
 - Where to?

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,510
It won't be more helpful than doing an actual kiss, even if I explain it every day for 100 days.

35
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,460
Ho Dol.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,830
♬  I'm gonna miss you  ♬

37
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,020
Why did you want to see me here?

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,140
What's wrong? Why not?

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,880
♬  I still care  ♬

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,130
I mean... This is not just a regular bar—

41
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,380
- I know. I'm a regular here. 
- What?

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,430
Did you still not notice it yet by chance?

43
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,010
♬  But real love is never a waste of time  ♬

44
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,530
I noticed you at one glance.

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,930
Do you know how much I have suffered because you ran way with our house rent deposit, Unni?

46
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,070
But now what?  You need money?

47
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,930
What about your great bastard?  What is he doing?

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,950
Don't call me again!  You and I are strangers from now on!

49
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,740
I don't even have a repair fee.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,990
- What's wrong? 
 - Pardon?

51
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,120
You looked like you were being absent-minded.

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,890
Do you want to eat? I'm going to make bibimbap.

53
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,850
No, I'll eat later.

54
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,280
You knew there was a person inside but you just turned off the light?

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,390
I'm sorry.  I mistook it.

56
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,110
- You didn't do on purpose? 
 - No.

57
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,110
I really didn't.

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,400
Ah, I was really surprised.

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,530
Joo Seo Joon.

60
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,420
I'm going to tell the teacher that you act strangely.

61
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,570
- I think the teacher should know — 
 - Noona already knew about it.

62
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,050
Then it doesn't matter whether I tell her if she already knew it.

63
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,040
What is it with you?

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,510
Do you think you are our family member because you live here?

65
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,630
You're our guest.  Guest.  A total stranger.

66
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,370
So don't put your nose into someone else's family business uselessly.

67
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,440
Just stay quietly then leave as soon as possible.

68
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,400
♬  Your ex  ♬

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,980
♬  We way too good at being friends  ♬

70
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,650
♬  Can we still hang out?  ♬

71
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,390
♬  On the low, get wild  ♬

72
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,390
♬  I don't want to be a, I don't want to...  ♬

73
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,800
What?  What did you ask me to do right now?

74
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,700
If you kiss someone else, then you'll know whether Lee Kang Woo has a problem or you have.

75
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,980
You're insane.

76
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,820
This is a very important problem between men and women.

77
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,710
Even if people love each other so much but the pairing is not perfect, their relation may last only a few months...

78
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,590
No, no.  I think it won't last even for a few days.

79
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,130
Even if so, I just hold any man and ask to let us do it?

80
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,100
Where is a better place than here to kiss without an ulterior motive?

81
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,550
What are you up to?

82
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,000
Seo Yeon's kiss skill—

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,040
No, we're doing nothing!  We just came here for free drinks.

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,020
Give us some drinks!  Drinks, drinks!

85
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,830
Shut your mouth up, understand?

86
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,690
Yes, let's do this.

87
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,800
Let's do it.

88
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,410
Let's do it.

89
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,400
- What? 
 - Let's try it.

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,610
Do what? What are you talking about?

91
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,490
What? What?

92
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,500
That was so sudden.

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,110
Let's do it again.

94
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,890
What?

95
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,100
How much did you drink?

96
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,470
- Huh? 
 - If you drank so much you won't remember, I wouldn't do it.

97
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm fine.  I didn't get drunk much.

98
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,890
You started it first.

99
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,420
- I... 
 - Yes?

100
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm going to marry Mi Kyeong.

101
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,170
You crazy!  Even so, did you tell him you would marry me?

102
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,850
Why am I like this?  Why on earth?

103
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,750
What do you mean why?  Because you've stayed away from the handsome guys morbidly all this time,

104
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,420
your nerve cells didn't react to that kind of stuff.

105
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,450
Don't drink anymore, you wench.

106
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,100
- I'm a nutjob. 
 - Right.

107
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,390
- I'm a stupid idiot and a butthole. 
 - Did you know that now?

108
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,670
I'm worse than toe cheese and the most trivial being in the world.

109
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,210
- Exactly. 
 - But my survival power is too strong unnecessarily.

110
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,340
I would manage to survive even if this world perished.

111
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,740
- And I would live such a crazy life again. 
 - You would.

112
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm really a stupid idiot and a butthole that is not helpful at all to this world.

113
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,810
We should have a rite of exorcism.

114
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,880
How did we get involved with so many people with flaws?

115
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,250
What are you doing?

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,410
I almost fainted.

117
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,870
But why did Joo Seo Yeon—

118
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,800
You say Joo Seo Yeon again?

119
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,070
That's why I told you that you should date other women.

120
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,760
You really show off so obviously that you've not had any experience dating.

121
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,930
Why do you get all amped on one woman?

122
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,950
Lee Kang Woo, life is really much shorter than you think.

123
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,510
Your time of sticking to only one woman is wasteful.

124
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,350
If you guys are not meant to be together, then just give up and move on.

125
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,020
Not meant to be together?  I can make it happen!

126
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,900
Me and Joo Seo Yeon together! That's it!

127
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,590
What crazy unrequited love is this?

128
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,720
You should be scared right now, you punk!

129
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,820
If you lay your hand in the wrong way with the slightest mistake, you can go to jail.

130
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,030
What on earth did Joo Seo Yeon tell you?

131
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,430
She said she would marry Kim Mi Kyeong.

132
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,220
Oh my!

133
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,320
What?

134
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,480
I don't know who it is but I'll kill it.

135
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,920
I'll kill it.

136
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,420
- Get out!  Get out! 
 - It's me!  It's me!  Wait!

137
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,820
- It's me! It's me! 
 - Get out!  Out!

138
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,100
Wait!  Wait a second!

139
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,490
What a mess!

140
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,230
I like it.

141
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,700
A clear mind of being frugal as using toilet paper instead of a tissue box.

142
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,770
Oh my!

143
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,250
Oh, yeah!

144
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,500
Your big heart that saves water bills and protects the environment by using dishes twice.

145
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,300
Why are you here?!

146
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,490
Kim Mi Kyeong, you said you wouldn't receive anything from men without a reason, didn't you?

147
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,260
Reason?  That's depending on what to make it.

148
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,160
What is this?  What is this?!

149
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,340
You're my woman from now on, Kim Mi Kyeong.

150
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,240
Grandmother?

151
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,930
Aigoo, Chief Director.

152
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,420
I really didn't know that you're a grandson of CEO. I never dreamed of it.

153
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,080
I must have caused you much inconvenience until now.

154
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,560
Why are you acting like this?  Stop bowing.

155
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,210
Why are you acting like this? Huh?

156
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,200
- You! Did you overuse your power? 
 - Pardon?

157
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,490
No, no, not all!

158
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,610
I should've acted more subserviently but I just went on my way by rules and my conviction.

159
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,180
All are my fault.

160
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,030
Vice Principal!

161
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,420
I'm going to kneel like this.

162
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,410
Please get up.

163
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,490
Please forgive me.

164
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,200
I did wrong.

165
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,230
Forgive me!

166
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,450
I should've known it but...

167
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,910
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

168
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,970
No, it's fine.  It's my fault that I forced you to do what you didn't want to do.

169
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,480
As I heard, you treated a temporary teacher as a servant.

170
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,510
It's not like that.

171
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,640
The higher the position you are in,

172
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,390
the more people watch and hear.

173
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,890
You should've behaved and behaved.

174
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,050
It looks like this position doesn't suit you,

175
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,470
so let's stop it.

176
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,490
- What are you— 
 - I don't need to watch you for one year.

177
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,450
You can't endure for one year that you promised.  Therefore come to the headquarters to work.

178
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,390
Grandmother!

179
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,280
I'll entrust this position to the right person.

180
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,240
What is this situation?

181
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,870
You told me to do what I want.

182
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,620
- So?  This chief director? 
 - Yeah.

183
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,410
So without any ulterior motive?

184
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,160
I do have an ulterior motive.

185
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,430
But well, you had one too, didn't you?

186
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,890
You must know well that

187
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,870
I would do a better job than you.

188
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,250
So do what you want to do, instead of being forced to do this job.

189
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,930
Grandmother isn't a stubborn person.

190
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,780
- Big news, big news.  Lee Kang Woo is getting out of his job. 
 - Pardon?

191
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,750
I think he got fired from the chief director position.

192
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,920
But is there a case that Shinhwa Food's grandson gets fired from Shinhwa Food's school?

193
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,350
What happened?

194
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,600
It's true that I overused my power a little bit.

195
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,940
A little bit?

196
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,270
More than a little bit.

197
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,950
Can you just say I didn't by paying lip service?

198
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,290
I can't lie.

199
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,830
It doesn't look like she is getting like Lee Min Hyeok but...

200
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,960
It's better this happened.

201
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,570
I heard it from Mi Kyeong.

202
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,470
If you hadn't been at the Seo Joon's performing place at the time, they would've gotten into big trouble.

203
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,570
Even though I didn't see you doing it, you're so cool.

204
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,110
You know my brothers are dressed to kill, don't you?

205
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,550
I'll buy the clothes you make for them to the best of my affordability.

206
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,100
I'll boast about your clothes if someone wears them.

207
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,920
Saying, "My friend made these clothes.  You should be honored to wear them."

208
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,720
So be upset a little bit.

209
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,990
Are we friends?

210
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,180
Just thinking of you, I'm trembling.

211
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,510
If I see you with my eyes, I'm going to go crazy.

212
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,800
Well, for me—

213
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,890
I'm like that.

214
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,510
So please like me.

215
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,830
And adore me too.

216
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,590
"Don't look for me."

217
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,660
"I met a good person so I'm leaving."

218
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,890
Please find her by all means.  No matter how much money you need, I'll give it to you.

219
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,390
How dare you run away with a man by night?

220
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,170
 Just thinking of you, I'm trembling. 

221
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,790
 If I see you with my eyes, I'm going to go crazy. 

222
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,530
Jang Mi.

223
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,970
Unni!

224
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,260
Why...

225
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,520
I was confused for a moment.

226
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,440
Unni, about Seo Joon...

227
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,300
Hold on a second.

228
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,180
Choi Ho Dol, why are you avoiding me?

229
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,600
That...  I didn't know you are...

230
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,720
So were you disappointed?

231
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,230
No, no.  I didn't expect it.

232
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,470
For me, I like you.

233
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,730
- Huh? 
 - How do you think about me?

234
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,590
That...

235
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,240
By chance, you have someone else?

236
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,110
No.

237
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,960
Then shall we date?

238
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,230
What do you think?

239
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,750
That's...

240
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,930
Don't get burdened.

241
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,370
Let's date slowly.

242
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,390
You saw it.  You saw it, right?

243
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,280
If we upload this on the internet, it'll be great.

244
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,480
If we upload this on the internet, it'll be great.

245
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Look at him. Wow.

246
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,830
Smile so you look better in the video.

247
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,330
Choi Ho Dol, wait.  Why do you act like that?

248
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
Why do you act like that?

249
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,190
- No way.  Did you think I was really one of your kind? 
 - Wow.

250
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Don't you go to work today?

251
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,600
Are you supposed to get tutored today?

252
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,370
Correct but we're not doing it today.

253
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,400
- Why? 
 - Tutor Ho Dol called me, he wouldn't do it because of his circumstance.

254
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,660
His circumstance?  What kind of circumstance?

255
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,380
I don't know.

256
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,250
 Well, I have a friend now, Hyung-nim. 

257
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,090
 He is a very cool and nice friend. 

258
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,170
 Don't look at me like that. I just came here as a customer. 

259
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,750
- How are things going on these days? 
 - Huh?

260
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,900
What about?

261
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,250
Is it okay not to take medicine?

262
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,310
I-It is okay.

263
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,840
Tell me honestly.

264
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,640
About what?  I'm telling you I'm fine.

265
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,460
If you worry about me so much, then raise my allowance.  My allowance right now is not enough—

266
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,070
 Noona, why are you doing this?  Don't play around. 

267
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,720
 I told you not to do this! 

268
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,660
 Noona! 

269
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,950
 Noona! 

270
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,440
 Don't do this! 

271
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,070
 Noona!  Open the door! 

272
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,810
I'm sorry.

273
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,070
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm fine.  If I live in the light, I have no problem.

275
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,460
You didn't heal completely.  Let's go to the doctor.

276
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,560
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

277
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,860
It's my fault.

278
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,470
No, it's my fault.

279
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,250
I'm sorry, Seo Joon.

280
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:13,310
Really!  That's why I didn't tell you because you would do this! Just like this!

281
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,730
Where are you going?

282
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,040
Running away!

283
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,890
You punk!

284
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,860
Tell him to go to the hospital where he used to go.  He listens to you the most among us.

285
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,270
He doesn't listen to me at all.

286
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,900
He is to be a man so he doesn't want to make Seo Yeon get worried.

287
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,610
I asked you so much.  I asked you not to tell.

288
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,220
What?

289
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:28,220
That is... On the day our parents got in an accident...

290
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,700
I was not home?

291
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,820
I think I went out to meet someone.

292
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,210
Why do you suddenly ask?

293
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,810
Just curious.

294
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,430
Do you remember something?

295
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,860
No, not really.

296
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,770
Never mind.

297
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,660
Seo Joon got angry a lot?

298
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,910
Did you tell?

299
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:20,560
I just worried that Unni Seo Yeon would get worried.

300
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,280
I did wrong, didn't I?

301
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,170
No. You did right.

302
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,330
It was the right thing.

303
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,660
 Why isn't she here yet? 

304
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,310
 She even asked my address because she has something to tell me. Why isn't she here? 

305
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,480
 "Am I just a joke?" I  had thoughts like that. 

306
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,490
What was I going to tell him?

307
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,530
It must be very important, seeing I said I would go there at night.

308
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,950
You're here.  You came late.

309
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,660
Yes.

310
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,560
Excuse me...

311
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,130
You found out that Joo Seo Joon...

312
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:32,830
Actually, the power went out when you were not here last time.

313
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,750
At the time...

314
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,860
He did?

315
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,170
I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you.

316
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,330
It's okay.  Seo Joon stopped you from telling me.

317
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,340
May I ask what happened to him?

318
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,560
On the day of my parents' accident,

319
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,560
we got a phone call and went to hospital frantically.

320
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:17,160
We forgot about young Seo Joo who was asleep in the room.

321
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,760
 Mom. 

322
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,910
 Mom. 

323
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,250
 Mom. 

324
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,030
 Mom. 

325
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,750
 Mom. 

326
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,970
 Mom. 

327
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,330
 Mom. 

328
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,470
 Mom. 

329
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,070
Until the next morning, he was alone like that.

330
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,700
How scared he was.

331
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,200
He just woke up as usual.

332
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,720
Mom and Dad...

333
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,100
disappeared forever.

334
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,320
How hard it was for you, too!

335
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:07,490
Still, as time passed, things got better little by little.

336
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,800
Even if it goes slowly,

337
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,900
little by little,

338
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,860
it'll get better.
