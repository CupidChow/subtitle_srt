00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
».

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,120
I got away a card out of these 3 boxes,

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,080
subsidizing some peer specialist melts

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,140
Z無梗

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,480
Z最終

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,680
The result of the announcement is that An Ning and Su Xun are the same.

7
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,880
Tang Yue and Zhou Pi are the same.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Today, the person who is the winner is Xiao Houchen.

9
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Who is the person that the public is?

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Why are you here again?

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
I've said it.

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Wait for me to hear the announcement.

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
I'll go to the next room.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
I'll go to the next room.

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
I'll go to the next room.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
I'll go to the next room.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
I've said it.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Wait for me to hear the announcement.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Why didn't you choose the same person as the princess?

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Didn't General Jiang always be against the princess?

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
How did he change his mind?

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
What do you know?

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
The princess...

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,480
likes me?

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
You know?

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Of course I know.

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
I haven't been here for a long time.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Go and have a look.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
Do you like the princess?

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Princess, please.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,880
If the princess doesn't choose General Jiang at last...

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,680
I hate her the most.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,180
But...

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,680
I don't want the princess to die.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
The princess is in trouble.

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Okay.

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Have a taste.

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
What's wrong?

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
General.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,280
What are you doing?

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
What are you doing?

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
I like General too.

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
You like me so much?

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,880
But...

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,880
When did you start to like me?

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
How could you be so sad?

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
No, no.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
That's the beginning.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Now I like you.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
As for me,

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,880
I only have the princess to choose the new one.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,880
If I can control my marriage,

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,880
I won't be here.

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,680
Maybe...

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,880
this is the final decision.

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Stop playing around.

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,680
The princess is called a sick girl.

58
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,280
She can't get out of the door.

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,880
I want to see what she can do.

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,080
No one has ever seen her face before.

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,480
Now she's in the Wudang Inn.

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,680
Do you know why?

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
Why?

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,280
The princess is a crazy princess.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,080
She wants to send the princess out.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,480
No one wants her.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Do you want that guest?

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
I'll send you a gift.

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Just kidding.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,680
No one wants her.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,880
She can only enter the inn at this age.

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,680
Send my sister to the side.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
I won't beat you to death.

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,880
The girl is just a joke.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Shut up.

76
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,880
What are you doing?

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,480
I don't want you two to eat together.

78
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
Let me go.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
President Zhao, what should we do?

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,480
Hurry up.

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
Don't be so stubborn.

82
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,480
Defendant.

83
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,280
Wait a minute.

84
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Director.

85
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,480
You're still saying that?

86
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
You know it.

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll add some chili water to you.

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,680
General Su,

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,280
they're bullying me as a crazy girl.

90
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
Beat them.

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,480
Stop.

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,680
I'm telling you.

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
Don't let me see you again.

94
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,080
I'll beat you once.

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
I can't do this.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Princess,

97
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,880
there's nothing to say about the rumor.

98
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
No one wants you to marry me.

99
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,880
I dare.

100
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
You're so pretty today.

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,080
You're so stupid.

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,280
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,880
I don't care about your past.

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
But in the future, you must guard the house of the General.

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,680
You must be very careful.

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
As a General,

107
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
you must protect my Su family's reputation.

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,680
I will definitely do my best to help you.

109
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Good.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,280
Where's the love?

111
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,880
General Su, I'm leaving.

112
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
Princess, what's wrong?

113
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,280
Let's go.

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,680
The guardian is in the hospital.

115
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Plan B.

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
Wait for me here.

117
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Don't be angry.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,680
Stop!

119
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,680
Lure her.

120
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Princess, move.

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Princess, be careful.

122
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
You're so stupid.

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
You're so stupid.

124
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
You're so stupid.

125
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
You're so stupid.

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Young master.

127
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Brother.

128
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Young master.

129
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Senior brother.

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
How dare you!

131
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Do you know how expensive a house is?

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Hurry and leave.

133
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Go.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Hurry up.

135
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Hurry up.

136
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Be careful.

137
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Be careful.

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Be careful.

139
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Isn't this my son's?

140
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Is this the kid who sent Su Xun 20 times?

141
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Mr. Zhao.

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
This is Mr. Wang's son.

143
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
He wants to be more close.

144
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Nonsense.

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Let Su Xun find out the original plan.

146
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Are you responsible?

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
He looks like me.

148
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Call dad.

149
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Su Han Han.

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Brother.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
You're blind.

152
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
How can you protect princess?

153
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Do you see it?

154
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
I saw it.

156
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
It's just a trap.

157
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I just got back to my senses.

158
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Nonsense.

159
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
What do you mean?

160
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
You know art.

161
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I'm not here to do anything.

162
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
I've seen a lot of things.

163
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm here to help you.

164
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Young master Xiao.

165
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
You're here to save me.

166
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
You...

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
You...

168
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Princess.

169
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Why do you keep giving me a bad news?

170
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
We're not married.

171
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
You don't need to care about me.

172
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Let me take the medicine.

173
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
You're brothers and sisters.

174
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
You're brothers and sisters.

175
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
He's my cousin.

176
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
No matter how hard I try,

177
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
he's really your brother.

178
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Nonsense.

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Xia Yu.

180
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
I'll go get the medicine.

181
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Xiao Hong.

182
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Please take the medicine for me.

183
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
bargain

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
to celebrate

185
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,480
Ai Wei,

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Ka Hua!

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Yan Yu arrived early to meet Yixing.

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
What's your name?

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,360
atori.

190
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm going to be a hero

191
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm going to be a hero

192
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm going to be a hero

193
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
