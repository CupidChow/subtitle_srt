Don't worry about me.

I'll choose the person you want to choose.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You don't understand anything.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You don't know who I want to choose.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You fool.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't go.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't go.

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is what you want to give me back.

Don't worry about me.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000

You must choose the person you want to choose.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What did you just say?

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000

You must choose the person you want to choose.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I hope you can leave the Wudang Inn

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000

Yes.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000

Go on the way.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's me.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's me.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's me.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's me.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why don't you start?

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I haven't chosen yet.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000

Tian'er.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Han Ping.

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After all, I'm the one who remains abandoned and noncommitted to the world.

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right now, I only know for a little time

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that I have not seen the one who lives and is just one.

60

Miss Wang!

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Xiong Zheng, you can't make a decision for me.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm telling you.

85
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Time is up.

86
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
You should get married.

87
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
You should cut your hair.

88
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Let me go. I can't be so sincere.

89
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I'm a human.

90
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
You can't control me.

91
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
It's not my choice.

92
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Princess, I never helped you.

93
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Why are you in a trance now?

94
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Su Xun, wake up.

95
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Everything here is fake.

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
The show is fake.

97
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
They just want to force you.

98
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
They are controlling everything.

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
They don't know what love is.

100
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600

101
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600

Don't move.

124
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Who dares to stop me?

125
