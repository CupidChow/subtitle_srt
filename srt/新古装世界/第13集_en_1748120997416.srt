1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The First Lady

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
I still have to get the ring.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
At least, I can pay back the Xiao Prince.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Princess, where are you going?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,800
General Su is really staying here for a night.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Of course not. I'm afraid that the Princess is leaving.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,300
General Su, let's rest in the inn today.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
I still have something to do.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,300
No need. Princess, let's go.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,300
Come.

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Everybody, look at me.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,300
I'm a princess.

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:20,800
I know you're

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,300
I know you're pretty.

15
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,040
The servants came today.

16
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,260
My Lady, this is ...

17
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,400
General Su.

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,780
Today, I have to Jaguar Manc matter.

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,800
聽 from the sire yesterday.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,060
I can't go back,

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,520
the wuxin just keeps there

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,380
I have to come back afterwards to get some things.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,040
Why don't you ask someone to comb through theyk?

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,380
Tell them to let you pick them up.

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,180
No.

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
I have to go camping.

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,980
You don't need to say anything.

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,180
I must go back to the Manor today.

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,780
Now that you've done your duty,

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,260
even if you have a way to get in,

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,980
you might not be able to get in.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,380
You need someone who can dance.

33
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
And I can help you.

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,980
It's too late to act.

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
I'll send you back after tonight.

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,500
But now,

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,380
please go with me to a place.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,380
General,

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,780
why did you bring me here?

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,780
It's far from here.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,780
This is where I practice sword.

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,980
Princess, do you want to practice sword?

43
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,380
I don't know how to do it.

44
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
How can you not know how to play the game

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
as my wife?

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,380
I'll teach you.

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
I'll teach you.

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,380
I'll teach you.

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,780
How can you not know how to play the game?

50
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,580
I'll teach you.

51
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Come on.

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
Left hand, attack.

53
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,980
General Su.

54
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,580
Bow.

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,580
提前.

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
Qigong.

57
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,780
Dajian.

58
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,780
Miaochun.

59
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Fengjian.

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Fengjian.

61
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,180
I can shoot too.

62
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,780
Princess, how high is your wu?

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,180
No.

64
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Princess,

65
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,180
you're just getting married.

66
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,180
General Su has been in the battlefield.

67
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,580
He should know

68
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,380
the world is more precious than life.

69
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,180
When a place of evil in Beijing

70
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,780
without a grass,

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,980
it's a rabbit.

72
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,980
It's worth it to have a person.

73
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,180
Princess, if you have a chance,

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm afraid it'll be the same.

75
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,780
I've suffered a lot recently.

76
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,780
I was too busy to persuade him.

77
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,580
Princess,

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,780
if you can marry me,

79
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,380
remain calm.

80
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,580
I will not give you a order

81
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,580
You have a wife and a princess

82
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Childe, I will kill that old thief directly

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
So that you can replace the position of the Prime Minister

84
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,580
The wine of the King of Tao, forget your identity

85
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,580
If you kill him, who will be your witness?

86
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,580
I will return the position of the monkey to you

87
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
I have used it

88
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,580
But it's not a good thing

89
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,580
I am afraid that the Prime Minister will be in trouble

90
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,580
If you two are in great danger

91
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,580
You are in danger

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,580
You are afraid that you will not be able to protect him

93
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,580
I am afraid that he hates me

94
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,580
I have another request

95
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
What?

96
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,580
You can't kill the horse

97
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
Princess

98
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Princess, what do you think of this courtyard?

99
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,580
It's a good place

100
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,580
It's good to have a good wedding

101
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
Is it good for our wedding room?

102
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,580
General, you are in a hurry

103
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
Princess is in a hurry

104
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,580
The house will be compatible

105
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
People

106
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
People

107
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
Consciousness

108
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Princess

109
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,580
It's almost dark, why don't you come back?

110
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,580
I need sweet food

111
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
This is my unique recipe

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Princess, if you like it, I will make it for you

113
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
What's the matter?

114
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,580
General Su, it's late

115
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Let's go to the Prime Minister's house

116
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
After eating, we will go

117
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
Is it good?

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
Is it hard to get in Beijing?

119
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,580
General Su, we will go to the Prime Minister's house

120
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Princess, don't you want to go out with me?

121
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
I don't

122
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,580
I can see that you are not in a good mood today

123
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,580
Do you think it's a good year for me?

124
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,580
Princess, you chose me, but you want to break the contract

125
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,580
Can you really live with me like this?

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Can you really live with me?

127
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,580
I heard that there are countless snowy mountains in Beijing

128
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,580
There are flying horses and high-ranking pilots

129
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,580
And the common love of coming and going

130
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Let's go to Beijing together

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Good

132
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
Let's move with them

133
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,580
Okay, where are you going? I will go there

134
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,580
You can only be my wife

135
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
I will take you to the Prime Minister's house

136
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Look at this hat

137
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
No, no, no, no, no

138
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
How is it?

139
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
You can wear whatever you like

140
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,580
It's better than me

141
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,580
The concert tonight is for you

142
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
It's not my choice

143
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
I didn't say I would go

144
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
Absolutely

145
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,580
I should really thank the star that you drew

146
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,580
My Zhou Pipa should be born on the stage

147
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Why are you going out with me?

148
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,580
My brother's concert, I can afford it

149
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Of course I want to be there

150
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,580
So the money you gave me that day was from him

151
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
You...

152
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
Of course not

153
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,580
We are just doing it for the sake of our own good

154
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,580
Wei Guike wanted to hear me sing

155
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
But I didn't agree

156
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,580
You are doing it for the sake of your own good

157
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
What about me?

158
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,580
You are a new person

159
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
You are nothing

160
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,580
How can you be worthy of my brother?

161
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
I don't want to hit women

162
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
But I give you the right

163
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Even if you are worthy of it

164
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,580
He can't be a guest

165
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
If he doesn't get on the show

166
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,580
It's time to go back to the past

167
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
Sister, sister, sister

168
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
I was wrong, I was wrong

169
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
You two are perfect

170
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,580
You are very suitable

171
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
You are not good at guessing

172
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,580
You are not good at guessing

173
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
You are not good at guessing

174
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I have nothing to do with him

175
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
He is so innocent

176
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
He is so innocent

177
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
Don't misunderstand him

178
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
He has nothing to do with me

179
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
Sister, just stay and watch the concert

180
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
You will love him when you sing with him

181
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
I can't

182
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Sister, look

183
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Look at me

184
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
I am wearing a white dress

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
Do I look good?

186
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
Not good

187
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
My sister said not good

188
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
Go, go, go

189
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Hurry up

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,580
What are you asking me?

197
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
The play of playing with the speed

198
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,580
This is the Xuan Zhuba

Don't you know that I am a man?

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
The distance between us is far away

209
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
The road is steep

210
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
My heart doesn't change

211
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,580
The dream is full of joy

The wind blows in the sky

218
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,580
The evil spirit is angry

219
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,580
The dangerous and strong spirit is in the back

220
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
The noise

221
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,280
Embracing how much yuan

224
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,660
