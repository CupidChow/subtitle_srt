00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,000
Friends!

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,620

00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,120
I have no idea

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,160
I become much better

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,120
when waiting in Beijing

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,160
I won't let you get hurt

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Mr. Yong Yue.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840

00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,580
They earned quite a clothing

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,540

I'm afraid of the world

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm afraid of the world

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
I'm afraid of the world

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm afraid of the world

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm afraid of the world

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,160

I'm afraid of the world

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
On the swing

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,400
Soy certainly

48
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,540
Prince-in-l奴, how offend me

49
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,460
Small matter

50
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,960
I thought I was standing on guard

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Princess

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,420
Be�ful the sect

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Princess, what are you looking for?

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Let me help you.

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
You should leave.

56
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Found it.

57
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
It's the flower I picked.

58
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
It can cure poison.

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
It can increase the skill.

60
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Let's go. Don't be punished.

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,160
The Prime Minister said that Xuan Zhihua is going to be the princess's family.

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Could it be...

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Princess!

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
The Princess of Xuan Zhihua

65
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Thank you, Su Xun.

66
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Princess, what did you call me?

67
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Su Xun.

68
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
I'll go first.

69
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Wait a minute.

70
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Princess, give me the key.

71
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
You can take it.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Princess, give me the key.

73
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Come in.

74
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Young Master, drink it.

75
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
You...

76
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Don't you remember me?

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Are you happy with General Su?

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
This is Xuan Zhihua.

79
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
You...

80
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
You came back to the Prime Minister's Mansion today to...

81
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,160
How do you know that I came back to the Prime Minister's Mansion?

82
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Why do you want to be the Prime Minister?

83
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Because you saved me.

84
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I said that I would make up for you.

85
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
You want to be my wife.

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Do you feel anything after you took the medicine?

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
I said that...

88
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
You are my heart's fault.

89
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Now you are happy with me.

90
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
You cured my sister.

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I never doubted you.

92
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
I don't believe that you don't have me in your heart.

93
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
You are better than me.

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I promised Pipa that I would go to see her performance tonight.

95
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
But I missed it.

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
I'll take you.

97
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I can't take it anymore.

98
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
That's great.

99
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Zhou Pipa.

100
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Zhou Pipa.

101
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
That's great.

102
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Zhou Pipa.

103
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Zhou Pipa, I love you.

104
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
You will be alive, Zhou Pipa.

105
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
You are so beautiful.

106
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Who will take you with me?

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I will kill you.

108
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I will kill you.

109
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
You are so handsome.

110
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
This is the last song tonight.

111
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
It's for you.

112
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
I feel better.

113
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
What should I say?

114
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I will kill you.

115
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
What did you do to her?

116
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I asked her

117
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
if she would drink with me.

118
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
You...

119
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Zhou Pipa.

120
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
We are so close.

121
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
This game is so hard.

122
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
In the end,

123
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
you are more and more...

124
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
I will kill you.

125
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
I will kill you.

126
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I will kill you.

127
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I will kill you.
