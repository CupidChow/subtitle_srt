00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,800
You've been in the inn for days.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Why is there no one to pick you up?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
So I should ask them.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Or else, I'll be disheartened.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Who do you think will be on the show?

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,600
It won't be.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I like to be close to the new family.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't care about the private life.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
I just want to be with them.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let go of me.

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I have a key.

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't keep it from me.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,400
You promised me you'd turn it back.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
I've chosen you.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,800
What else do you want?

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
You promised me.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,200
But I'll sing you a song.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,400
No.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,800
The rouge.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,800
The rouge.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Come and have a look.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
You like this?

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,800
Miss, buy one.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I made the rouge.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,600
You can only see it.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
He said he loved music every day.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,600
He's not a man.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
We've sold all the shops.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
And he's still on the street.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
He has no parents.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Who can take him?

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Luckily, he's not alive for a few days.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let me help you.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
They said you're not a man anymore.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,400
They said it's true.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Who can choose to be on the show?

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Is he the one who chose to be on the show?

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
He's not.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
But you are.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Foxes are foxes.

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
And men are foxes.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
You can't even see yourself.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You only dare to say he's the one who chose to be on the show?

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
Listen.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,600
As long as I'm here,

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
he won't die.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,600
But if I see you dare to mess with him,

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
you'll die.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
Get out of here.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You got frustrated?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
What are you kidding me?

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
The audience says,

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,600
you will suffer slowly.

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
Did you know what I said?

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I just don't know it.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,600
But I watch them workingtravelling in fear.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
You look down on me.

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
He fought on himself staying at home.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
That turns into a reason of money.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,200
How is he?

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
I'm afraid of death.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm afraid of death.

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Who said you'd die?

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Anything else?

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I'll get another one.

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Do you remember?

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Guike woke up today.

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
You're so good.

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Do you remember?

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
You said you liked singing on the stage.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,200
You wanted to sing a song for our fans.

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I don't understand.

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
But Pipa likes music.

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I want to help you watch the concert.

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Are you willing?

82
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
The concert?

83
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
You're the biggest singer on the stage.

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
You're the only one.

85
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Sing it for us.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Guike is kind.

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
But I don't think you should...

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
It's the best way to repay us.

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Don't you want to be a singer?

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
President Zhao, I want to buy you a drum.

91
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Give it to me.

92
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
How much?

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
How much?

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
It's so big.

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
It's 200 taels.

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
So much?

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
The capital doesn't use firewood.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,200
We can only use the power of the wine.

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
But we don't have that much.

100
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I have.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Where did you get so much money?

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Could it be you?

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
You're jealous?

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Or you're jealous?

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Who's jealous?

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
You're more beautiful than me.

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Money?

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I can spend it.

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
But you want to come to my concert.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Concert?

111
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Do you want it?

112
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Yes.

113
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I want it.

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I want it.

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I want it.

116
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
You want it?

117
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
I promise you.

118
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Why do you need so much money?

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Ruye, you know it.

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I don't care.

121
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
My dad invested in this show.

122
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
What's wrong with the concert?

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
My princess.

124
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
The concert will be very serious

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
if it's about the promotion of Zhou Pi.

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
That's better.

127
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I said it's necessary.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
The operation stage is not big.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
The technical department will come soon.

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Confirm the safety.

131
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
The location of the bodyguard.

132
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Hurry.

133
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Strange.

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Who's there?

136
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Dad.

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Fu.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Cui.

139
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
You're dead.

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
You're the princess of the old man and the woman.

141
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
What?

142
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Lin Cangyue is back to the Prime Minister's Mansion?

143
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
You wait for him.

144
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
What's wrong, President Zhao?

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Tell the Prime Minister to go back to the Prime Minister's Mansion.

146
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes.

147
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Why are you so happy?

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
I'll go back to the Prime Minister's Mansion with you today.

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
I bought the medicine in the mansion.

150
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
What did you say?

151
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
In the Prime Minister's Mansion.

152
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
When the young man is born, he will be exposed.

153
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
The princess is still in the mansion?

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Of course.

155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
I'll kill the old man and the woman.

156
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Yue'er.

157
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Yue'er.

158
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Father.

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Yue'er.

160
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
You all go back first.

161
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Yes.

162
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Yue'er.

163
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Why didn't you tell me before you came back?

164
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I'm so afraid of being caught.

165
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Father.

166
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I've never begged you since I was a kid.

167
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Now I want to beg you for something.

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Tell me.

169
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
The flower of choice.

170
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
The flower of choice?

171
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
No.

172
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Go back.

173
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
No.

174
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Guards.

175
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
What is this?

176
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Yes.

177
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Guards.

178
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Send the lady to the inn to rest.

179
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
I'll take Su Xun down.

180
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Don't come to see me.

181
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
I'll go get it myself.

182
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
What are you still doing?

183
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Go after her.

184
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes.

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Catch her.

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Miss.

187
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Miss.

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Miss, don't run.

189
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Miss.

190
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Changxuang, you're in danger.

191
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Do you hear me?

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Miss, be careful.

193

Miss, be careful.

It's you.

You're back to the martial arts world?

196

I've been to the new palace for a while.

197

206
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Why don't you watch carefully?

207
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't move.

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Where's the gift?

209
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
You made it.

210
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
