1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
You are now close to him, you will stimulate him

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Didn't you say before that you have separated the memory of life?

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
How could this be?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
President Su, we will take the consciousness of the dead person

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Entering the body of the person in the room

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is through a chip

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
The memory of the chip can be separated from the life

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
It can also be entered into the ancient memory

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
But Su Xun is temporarily added

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The chip is not in the right time

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
So there are several problems

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You are blaming me

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The End

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The End

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The End

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The End

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mr. Zhao, please be a good boy

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course not

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I heard that you signed a contract with Fu Xi for this show

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You will also be a family member

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I provided all these places

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can leave at any time

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
President Su, don't worry

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
We will rediscover Su Xun's chip

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
We can recover the normal tomorrow

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I promise this time I will do everything

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
I will completely bring him back to you

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
My son likes Lin Cang Yue

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
I want him to be with the person he likes

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Happy person

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
President Su, I understand

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
President Zhao

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
But what if Lin Cang Yue doesn't like Su Xun?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He must like it

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Fu Xi

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I am here

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why is Su Xun's memory back to normal?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have reminded you

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The memory of the chip will be in the future

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Fu Xi, you are not in a few days

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I can't use it in the long run

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will destroy it all

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will try my best to help you

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I let you live once again

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But you made me lose my mind

47
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Fu Xi

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Kill Xiao Hou Chen

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Sorry, Fu Xi can't kill you

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
I didn't say I let you do it

51
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I let you give Xiao Hou Chen the information of the rebel

52
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
to Su Xun

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Okay, I am in the heart of the operation

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
General Su is very skilled

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
He will be fine

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
We will wait for him

57
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Tang Huluo

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
You are sweet and sour

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Come

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Okay, you are good

61
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Do you want to eat Tang Meng?

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
You will feel better

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Since young

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My father didn't allow me to eat Tang

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He said

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He wanted to control his own will

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When will Xiao Jie become so obedient?

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Otherwise

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He won't do anything for me

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When did I ask you to be so kind?

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I am afraid to ask you who you are in love with

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Then

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's just a game

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
He said everything to you

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
If Xiao Jie wants to eat Tang

77
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
There is no other way

78
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Xiao Jie

79
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Young master Xiao

80
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Although I am a little bit tired

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I am not a happy woman

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's Noble Lady Wei who asked me to hand over the jade

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,320
Generous

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
You have seen it

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Now you need me

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Will you carry the five bottles of noises?

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Say something

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You heard

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
R ou?

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,040
Are you jealous?

91
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,640
Of who?

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
This is the clothes

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
gestellt dragon Isake sent to you

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,480
I didn't join him alone

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
Who asked you

96
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,000
If you don't believe me

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,000
You can take it

98
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,000
Load me away

99
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
You take it back

100
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm not jealous

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I don't know if he knows what I'm doing.

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Then I'll sew this one myself.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Don't you like it?

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You'll make clothes?

105
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,720
I made all the clothes in the building by myself.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Wait.

107
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I'll sew it.

108
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
How is it?

109
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
The dress looks good on you.

110
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
It's better to wear it on the dress.

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Please take a look at the wedding dress.

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
I'll ask your wedding dress.

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Do you think it looks good on you?

114
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
You guys know nothing.

115
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
You'll get used to it.

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Let's go.

117
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
It looks good on you.

118
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
This is my first dress.

120
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
You haven't been a brother for so many years.

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I didn't send you home.

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
I don't have a brother anymore.

123
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I thought I'd never have a brother again.

124
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
We've been separated for many years.

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Now we've just found him.

126
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,720
So you came to the inn just for him?

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,720
No wonder you're a man.

128
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
You must be very cool.

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Can you let me live as a brother?

130
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I can.

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
From now on, you'll have a brother.

132
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
And me.

133
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
We're all your family.

134
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Cheers.

135
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Thank you.

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
It seems

137
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
you're a little bit scared.

138
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I don't know.

139
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
But when I think of him,

140
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
I feel the same.

141
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
We won't die.

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,720
But if my method works,

143
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I'll never see my sister again.

144
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
What method?

145
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
You'll know it in the future.

146
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
But

147
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I don't know if you can take revenge.

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
He told you about the revenge?

149
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
What do you think?

150
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
If I have a chance, I'll help him.

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
How is that possible?

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
What's impossible?

153
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
I'll go beg my father

154
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
to find evidence and give him a credit.

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
You don't know.

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
I know.

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
He told me everything.

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I don't like people who lie to me.

159
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Have you drunk?

160
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
You're here.

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
The wine in the wine is too bad.

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
You just drank it.

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I know.

164
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
I'll take him back.

165
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
You should rest early.

166
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Brother.

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,720
You'll live and deal with everything.

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I never fear death.

169
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I won't run away.

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
As a man of the wind,

171
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm a nationalist.

172
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
How can a princess say such a big deal?

173
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
But I hope you can all live.

174
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Some people should die.

175
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
For her,

176
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
even a princess' identity can be used.

177
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm willing to do anything.

178
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Do you know who he is?

179
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
General Su.

180
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm willing to do anything.

181
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm willing to do anything.

182
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm willing to do anything.

183
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm willing to do anything.

184
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I'm willing to do anything.

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm willing to do anything.

186
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm willing to do anything.

187
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm willing to do anything.

188
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm willing to do anything.

189
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm willing to do anything.

190
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
I'm willing to do anything.

191
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
