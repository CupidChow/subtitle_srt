1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The End

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come here.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It hurts.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm on the street.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why is there a secret weapon?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is it the flower trick you played again?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The most real thing is your temper.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How can you do that to yourself?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You don't dare to do that.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But if you can make the girl feel bad for me,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
it's worth it.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It really hurts.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
As long as you don't talk nonsense,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
it won't hurt.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Cause you love me so much.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But you never want to date me again.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,600
Are you thinking about marriage?

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,700
I still need to learn.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,960
allez

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,620
Hush

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,000
All right, all right.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You'll do that.

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,680
Yes.

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,360
I do.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Transεν

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,600
Through the nonsense

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
First, let her take out the bait and play with it.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Then she can't protect your heart.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
That's why she chose you.

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
If it's really useful, why are you still here?

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm here to sing a song for you.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
You're so ridiculous.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Then why did you come here?

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Don't ask me.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
You're hurt.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I accidentally touched you.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
But I don't want to see you.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Since you're here, I won't bother you anymore.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
An Ning.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
She's just a casual girl.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Don't mind her.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I envy her.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
She's as thin as the water in the inn.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
She can control her life.

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm curious.

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
If you don't like her,

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
why don't you help her marry you?

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
You can't find a girl who's lucky.

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
So many girls like you.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Why are you here?

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Although they like me,

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
but no one cares about me.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
In their opinion,

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm just a singer.

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
You're the one who's not good enough to be yourself.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You decide what kind of person you are.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
You're happy to be able to sing for a lifetime, right?

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm afraid I'll be rude.

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
If you don't mind,

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I'll be your companion.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Mr. Erwen, you're so bright.

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
You're so kind.

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I'll be your companion.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,600
It's like the real wind falling down.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm like a twin to you.

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
What is she supposed to sing?

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
She's like the ring in a squid lunch.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,600
There's no one to take her with her.

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Let's split up.

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
Superенд truth

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,540
Let's praise the people

72
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,060
the trend على

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,300
Don't ask me

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
I know you'll be a guest

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,160
Peaceless

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,120
while

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,680
Unlike what you've never been

78
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,660
After spending lifetime

79
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,900
in vain

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,200
Looked so pleasant

81
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,140
Why must you need me?

82
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,140
I'm going back to think about it.

83
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,140
I was too anxious the other day.

84
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
I haven't seen you for so many years.

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,140
I was a little bit worried that you would get married once you meet me.

86
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Aren't you curious about how you've been doing these years?

87
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Have you ever thought about it?

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Since you disappeared, I've been looking for a man.

89
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:36,140
I've been walking around the world for four years.

90
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Until I came to the capital,

91
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,140
I heard that there was a god named after my brother.

92
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,140
I thought it was a coincidence.

93
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Jin, can you tell me why you left me without any reason?

94
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,140
Why did you take my brother?

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
For revenge.

96
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
You must be with the princess.

97
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Yes.

98
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Your murderer is...

99
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,140
Cheng Xiao.

100
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Wait for me.

101
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,140
I will pay you back for your brotherhood.

102
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,140
Can you help me, Ning'er?

103
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Miss An, I'm looking for you.

104
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Sorry for disturbing you.

105
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
What do you want?

106
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,140
I think you just got back to your dress.

107
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,140
You must have not brought enough luggage.

108
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
You asked Pipa to pick two dresses for me.

109
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
Look, you like them.

110
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

111
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,140
I've got the thread.

112
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Please take it back.

113
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,140
You are a good girl.

114
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,140
I don't like any of the dresses that Pipa picked.

115
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Young Master Xiao, you are really a good girl.

116
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
You are so busy today.

117
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,140
You are looking for a way out for yourself.

118
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Pipa got hurt.

119
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
Miss An is just a herb to me.

120
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Miss, are you jealous?

121
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,140
Who is jealous of you?

122
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Then...

123
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Do you want some candy?

124
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,140
I don't want your stuff.

125
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
I don't want your stuff.

126
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
General.

127
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,140
General, you are so rich.

128
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Everyone is so upset.

129
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,140
They can't see you anymore.

130
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,140
Everyone has seen it.

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
You didn't see the scene that day.

132
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,140
The whole camp is a cry.

133
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
Everyone is so upset.

134
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
How is the situation in Beijing?

135
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,140
General, the enemy army has not been out of the city.

136
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
The enemy army is in a difficult situation.

137
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Without the commander of the general,

138
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
the soldiers dare not attack the city easily.

139
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
General,

140
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,140
I have a chance to fight with you.

141
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,140
General, it seems that the food is low-key.

142
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,140
Not low-key.

143
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,140
That's what you like to fight.

144
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
It has nothing to do with the death.

145
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,140
It's me and the princess who are together.

146
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
We are willing to protect the country.

147
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
Princess.

148
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Princess.

149
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,140
If you marry the Prime Minister,

150
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
how can the emperor see you?

151
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
The death is here.

152
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,140
Everyone, go back to your room.

153
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Okay.

154
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
I have to go back.

155
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
You go back too.

156
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,140
Yes.

157
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
I'll tell the soldiers to go back.

158
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
General, go back.

159
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Go.

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
How is it?

161
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,140
How many cities have you been killed?

162
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,140
He is kind.

163
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,140
Tianzhen is well-protected.

164
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
It seems that

165
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,140
he is confident in your plan.

166
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,140
I want him to be happy with you.

167
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
You mean

168
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,140
General Su will be killed?

169
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,140
I heard that there is a man who is afraid of flowers.

170
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,140
Give him a face.

171
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Save him.

172
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
The fifth type of love

173
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,140
in the world is in the hot air.

174
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Who will be the last to die?

183
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
The two of you, go back now.

184
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
Go back to your room.

185
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
Go back.

186
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
Go back to your room.

187
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Go back.

188
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
Son.
