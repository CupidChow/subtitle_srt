1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The First Lady

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What did you ask the Princess?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I ask the Princess

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Who will be the first to be oiled tomorrow?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Princess

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why do you want to do this?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
General Su

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I will discuss with you later

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Xiao Hongchen is a good man

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He knows martial arts

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The First Lady

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The First Lady

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Princess

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You know everything

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
General Su

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Xiao Mo has been learning martial arts since he was a child

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He has changed his clothes in the middle of school

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He is not a good man

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Young Master Xiao has helped me with the sword

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will give you Xuan Zhihua

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So his health is getting better

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He has a lot of power

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Princess

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You really take it out?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Princess

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You risked your life to go to the Prime Minister

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You did this for Xuan Zhihua?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know that Xuan Zhihua is my heart?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You said you would protect me

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But you have to take my heart

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And kill me

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
General Su, I will do it

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are so good

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
General Su

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Song Cheng

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
General Su

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have arranged some things

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please listen to me

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't hurt anyone

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You are still alive?

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are still alive?

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You all wait for me

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will go to the Prime Minister

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mom

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't care who gets married

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's all for your own good

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you really want to do it for me

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can let me decide it myself

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What do you want?

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I won't buy it for you

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We are not talking about the same thing

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I really can't communicate with you

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mom

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mom

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hurry up

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Take off your mask

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Go to the ad

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't want to let me go even if you are dead

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You want me to be like a monkey

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And be turned off

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you have any feelings for me?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't want to talk to my son

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Son

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's mom

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's mom's fault

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's mom's fault

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's mom's fault

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
As long as you accompany Cheng

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can have the body of the five kings

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And live a life of life

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My lord

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As long as you come back

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can do anything

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are saying so much

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If I could do this

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I wouldn't have died

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Son

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was mom's fault

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But this time it's mine

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You must come back with me first

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Since this

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't want to help you with this life

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Son, no

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Son, no

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Zhao Kaixuan

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Su

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We can re-create the chip

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And delete his memory

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let him go back to the past

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Can you do that?

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then why are you still standing there?

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hurry up

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you doing?

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's the command

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What are you doing?

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We come to the Wudang Inn to choose who

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We all depend on our own wishes

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How can the lord not choose him?

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He is so stupid

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's like you owe him

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I did owe him

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I promised him

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The lord said

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was deeply in love with Su Xun

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But it's true

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ming'er

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have your own reason

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I must go to General Xunsu

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Brother

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Go after him

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't want to force him

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now he must be very difficult

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Difficult

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's because you touched his heart

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't ask who the princess wanted to be with

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That is

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I asked who he was in love with

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I didn't expect the princess to be so naive

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why did you let him go after the princess?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't remember?

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't remember

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I was in the Wudang Inn

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Be careful, I'll pull you

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are so stubborn

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Princess

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You don't remember?

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't remember

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was in the Wudang Inn

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be careful, I'll pull you

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are so stubborn

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Su Xun

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's me

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why did you come here?

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm here waiting for you

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry, sister

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry, father

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If Prime Minister really loves you

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He won't let you go

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Why should I owe you?

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
As Prime Minister

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I must think for the country

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I should be his daughter

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I have the heart to owe you

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I see

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You know what you like

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to choose wine and make wine

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You are right

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I should be my own wife

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Now you are better

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't want to lose you

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I made a good plan

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Take you to the inn together

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Go to Beijing together

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Nothing can happen in the future

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will face it with you

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How about you?

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
President Su

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You will be close to him

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Didn't you say

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You have a long memory?

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How could that be?

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you want to know

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's not a secret

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm afraid of the future

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I want to go to the capital

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to take a breath

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to be the most handsome

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I want to be the hero

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I know the wind and the wind

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I know the sound of the sword

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm going to win

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not afraid of the distance

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not afraid of the road

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm going to run

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to run

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm not afraid of the sun

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't want to burn

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The smoke is in my heart

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't get away

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The road is not changing

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I want to go to the capital

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I want to take a breath

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I want to take a breath

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I want to be the most handsome

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I want to be the most handsome

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to be the most handsome

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I want to be the most handsome

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to give you my hug

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I've got a hot spot

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
in the middle of the night

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Shiva

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Mr. Shiva

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What is the reason?

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The smile is firm, victory is in the rear

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
The sword is in the heart, don't be afraid of being swayed

201
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,000
The smile is firm, victory is in the rear

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The sword is in the heart, don't be afraid of being swayed

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
The smile is firm, victory is in the rear

204
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,000
The sword is in the heart, don't be afraid of being swayed

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,500
How can I win? The heart is not changing

206
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,000
The sword is in the heart, don't be afraid of being swayed

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The sword is in the heart, the heart is not changing

208
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Ah!

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
The sword is in the heart again

210
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Ah!

211
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
The sword is in the heart again
