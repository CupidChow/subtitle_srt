00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Fu Xi, is everything normal?

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Everything is normal.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
Normal?

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,900
If it wasn't for Ding Gonggong,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,000
do you know how much I would have lost?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,300
How did you choose to be the voice actor in this episode?

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,300
It's all so hard to control.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,300
All five guests have been affected by the previous events.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,400
Their personalities are different. Fu Xi can't predict it either.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Five guests?

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
You treat them as real people?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
Then who do you think will be eliminated?

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Su Xun.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Because of the analysis from the data,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
Zhou Pipa and An Ning have the highest voice.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,600
And there is a love story between the hidden love and the consumption of drugs.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,100
What do you know about love?

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,700
Fu Xi's index program is not sensitive.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,100
It's good that you understand.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,400
This Su Hanhan is really unbearable.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Tomorrow, arrange a camp.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,800
President Zhao, you mean...

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
The End

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,800
Everyone, you need to spend the night here tonight.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Prepare all the items yourself.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I remind you all.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,300
There are only three days left.

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,100
You should cherish them.

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,300
Let's go.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
Princess must really like you.

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,100
Ning'er.

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,000
We will leave alive.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't worry about Princess.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Okay.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
General Su.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Should we settle our past debts?

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,600
You want to avenge Xiao Bai?

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
An Ning.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
An Ning.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,500
Don't be rash. You're hurting Wei Quanye.

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,600
Admit it.

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Your leg...

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
You remember.

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,600
It's so good to see you again.

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Good thing we came together.

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,100
Do you really have me in your heart?

48
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
If you give me another chance,

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I will confess my love.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Let's go together, okay?

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
I'll be where you are.

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Xiao, it's late.

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Why don't we go pick some firewood

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
and get some food?

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Okay.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,800
I have something to tell General Su.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,700
I'll go too.

58
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,800
You should stay here.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
It's okay.

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Xiao Chen.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,200
I don't know what trick you used

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,400
to make the emperor and princess all be fooled by you.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
But as long as I don't die,

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
you won't succeed.

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,600
It's important to have faith.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
But if you find out your own faith

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,200
is just a game designed by others,

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,600
you will regret it.

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't understand what you're talking about.

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
I don't understand what you're talking about.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Leave the inn with me.

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,600
You will understand.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
You are a traitor.

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
You even tried to provoke me to rebel.

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
You will be punished.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Su Xun, think about it.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Everything here is fake.

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Only Qiu Sheng is real.

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Stop talking nonsense.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Stop.

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Su Xun.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Xiao Chen, do you want to die by yourself

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
or do you want the princess to die?

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Su Xun, let her go.

86
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
You say you have the right to be loyal and filial.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Is this how you treat the princess?

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,600
She should be my wife.

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,200
It's all because of you.

90
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
General Su, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
Shut up.

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Xiao Chen, the princess can risk her life to save you.

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
If you want to save her, then kneel.

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Let her go. I'll take care of her.

96
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
You are really a love-hate couple.

97
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Why don't you need me to tell you?

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Xiao Chen.

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
No.

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
No.

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Su Xun.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Su Xun.

105
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Xiao Chen.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Xiao Chen.

107
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
Xiao Chen.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
You still won't let me go.

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not afraid of anyone.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm willing to kill you.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Protect my back.

112
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,600
I can see the world.

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Why are you wearing a pipa?

114
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
It's cool, isn't it? It's a guitar.

115
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Guitar?

116
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Oh, pipa.

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
This pipa is my most precious thing.

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,600
If I'm not here, keep it for me.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Don't talk nonsense.

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You won't die.

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
Are you going to choose me?

122
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Where are my brother and princess?

123
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
An Ning.

124
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
What are you doing?

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,800
I want to...

126
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Say something. If you don't say it, I'll leave.

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Are we getting married?

128
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
What did you say?

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,200
I thought a lot last night.

130
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,400
If I can live again,

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,800
I must make up for my past regrets.

132
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to marry you.

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,600
I'll only sing for you for the rest of my life.

134
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
But compared to all this,

135
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I want you to live on.

136
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,800
I don't want you to be attacked by the public.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
If I'm not here,

138
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
will you be happy?

139
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,200
You...

140
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
An Ning, marry me.

141
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm a vulgar person. I'll marry all of you.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll leave it to you.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I'll take good care of you.

144
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Let's get married. Are you willing?

145
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
What's wrong?

146
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
An Ning.

147
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
An Ning.

148
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
An Ning, are you okay?

149
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Mr. Wang, thank you for trusting Fuxi Technology.

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Sign it if you have no problem with the terms.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As Ms. An's husband, I remind you again.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Although Ms. An has a chance to return to the New Gu Zhuang world,

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,800
the premise is that she must complete the match.

155
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,500
And return to the real world, she can only live with the matchmaker.

156
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,200
Otherwise, Fuxi Technology will take back Ms. An's body.

157
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,100
As long as she can live, I'll sign everything.

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay.

159
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
Are you okay?

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
What's wrong?

161
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Do you want to hurry up?

162
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Drink some tea to warm up.

163
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
The tears that are running down my face

164
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
are so bright in front of me

165
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Ning'er, why aren't you eating?

166
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I only drink to see.

167
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I love you.

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
An Ning, are you...

169
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
The night is getting dark.

170
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Are you nervous now, An Ning?

171
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
The firm smile is smiling at me.

172
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,400
The firmness is in the sky. No matter how far it is.

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,600
The road ahead is unchanging.

174
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Life is so hard.

175
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The courage is in the heart.

176
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
The color is so bright.

177
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,600
The dream is burning.

178
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
The courage is in the heart.

179
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
The step is so far.

180
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,600
The road ahead is unchanging.

181
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
The dream is so bright.

182
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
The courage is in the heart.

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
The color is so bright.

184
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
The dream is burning.

185
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
The dream is burning.

186
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,600
The night is getting dark.

187
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
The heart is beating fast.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
The firm smile is smiling at me.
