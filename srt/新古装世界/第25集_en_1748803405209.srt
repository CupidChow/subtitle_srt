00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Son.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Mom.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,120
Son, you're finally back.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,560
Mom, I miss you so much.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,280
Mom, you're so cold.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,960
The meeting is almost over.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
You promised to come back alive, okay?

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:08,560
The End

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,760
I miss you so much.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,120
Mom, can you listen to me?

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Say it.

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
Mom, listen to me.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm so grateful

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,520
for everything you've done for me.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
But I hate all of this.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I was wrong to take the money and make a mistake.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,560
I also paid for the price of my life.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
But I was lying on the cold road

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
and faced the last moment of my life.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,040
Do you know what my feeling is?

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm so relieved.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,160
I've never felt this way before.

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,560
But when I woke up as General Su,

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,560
I realized what real life is.

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
I had my own faith there for the first time.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I could pursue my own hobby

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,160
and make my own decision.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Thank you for giving me a second life.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Mom, I've grown up.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Just this once.

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
Please give me the whole choice.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Lin Canyue and Xiao Hu Chen can't die.

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
I owe them that.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
If I continue to lie,

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
I'll never give up on my life.

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Can you give me the last time

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
and make me your wife?

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll never give up on my life.

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,560
General Su, please wait outside.

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
We're going to start the operation.

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Second Sister.

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Don't be afraid.

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll never give up on you.

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
If you don't want to be with me,

46
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
I'll help you.

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
You're so ugly.

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
You're a fool.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Two hours left.

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Time to get married.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Time to cut the hair.

81
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
I believe that you've been through this period of time.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
You've been through this period of time.

83
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
You've got an answer in your heart.

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Please make your own choice.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Write your own choice on the paper.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
You'll be handed over to the one who's in charge of the case.

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
You'll be handed over to the one who's in charge of the case.

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
You'll be handed over to the one who's in charge of the case.

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I don't need to think about it.

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll choose General Su.

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
General Su.

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
If you choose the princess now,

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
you can get married in time.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
I...

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I want to choose An Ning.

96
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
General Su.

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
You like An Ning?

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
What's the meaning of this?

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm not sure.

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm just curious.

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm curious.

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm curious.

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm curious.

104
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm curious.

105
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm curious.

106
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
I've never had a crush on General Su.

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
I don't know.

108
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Is Su Xuan crazy or am I crazy?

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
He wants to choose An Ning the last day.

110
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Except for the one who's in charge of the case,

111
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
the rest of you go back and get changed.

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
General Su.

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
You don't have to make a choice.

114
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll give you another time to think about it.

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Princess.

116
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I'll take this.

117
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Just take it away.

118
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Fu Xi.

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm here.

120
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Lin Cang Yue and Xiao Hou Chen

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
kept the memory of the enemy.

122
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Now it seems that

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
the result of Xiao Hou Chen's death

124
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
is that there is nothing wrong with it.

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Xiao Hou Chen's current memory is not deleted.

126
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
It will attract other people's memories to be changed.

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
You still don't understand human nature.

128
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Tai Heng.

129
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Chief Zhao.

130
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
What do you think?

131
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I...

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Chief Zhao.

133
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Ning.

134
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm choosing you.

135
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Chief Zhao.

136
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I'll choose you.

137
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Let's get married.

138
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
But don't worry.

139
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm not against you.

140
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
We can still be brothers and sisters.

141
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Ning.

142
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm sorry for you these years.

143
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I can't help you.

144
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm not worthy of your brotherhood.

145
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Go and choose the one you want.

146
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Then,

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I'll live for you.

148
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
But you've chosen Su Xun.

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
What should I do?

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Princess.

151
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
You must choose Su Xun.

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

153
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Princess, why?

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Do you really love someone?

155
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
If you really love someone,

156
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
then you must choose Su Xun.

157
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm not the one you choose.

158
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
She'll never be happy

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
when she marries me.

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
So,

161
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
you must choose Su Xun.

162
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Princess, do you really think

163
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
it's useful to me?

164
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
No.

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll take you with me.

166
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Let's go.

167
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Chief.

168
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
In the hospital

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
for what 화치 formulas say,

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
your skin wasako used for thousands of times.

171
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
It was more than four hundred times more.

172
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Did you accept it?

173
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Let me go.

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,860
I can't live without it,

175
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
as if it's a noose.

176
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
You are satisfied now?

177
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
I can't drive away the Console of Wudang.

178
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,280
to encourage me.

179
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,440
But I don't think I can match her.

180
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,440
No matter how much you have been deceiving me,

181
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
I won't change my mind.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,840
I hope she will never think of me.

183
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
This is the first day.

184
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm very happy.

185
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
I hope you

186
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,480
will be with me

187
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
and see me again.

188
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,760
Dr. Lin,

189
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,720
you must live on.

190
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
The secret of the dream.

191
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,840
The time has come.

Yes.

Xiao Man,

195
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,680
you must choose the right person.

196
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
You don't know anything.

197
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,280
You don't know that I want to choose someone.

198
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,680
I want to see your smile.

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,880
I'll win you over.

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,080
The road to let go is not changing.

202
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm afraid of the future.

203
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
I want to be with you.

204
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
I want to be with you.

205
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I don't want to be alone.

206
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll always be with you.

I want to feel it

218
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
The wind blows, the heart beats

219
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
The sound of the sword is so strong

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,880
