Princess, no matter what decision you make,

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we will support you.

Inform the hunter to catch him!

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't you understand?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Inform the hunter to catch him!

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Great!

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Please come in.

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Brother, wait for me!

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm here!

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't move!

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Open the door!

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hu Xi, open the tracking chip!

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The tracking chip has been opened.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wudang Inn, hurry!

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mr. Zhao, what about the live broadcast?

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Cut the advertisement!

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Cut the advertisement.

Pipa, you're really good at magic.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's just a small piece of cake.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's all thanks to Qiqi.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Can we really escape?

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We've already reached this point.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
At least we've succeeded.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're so timid.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're not the An Ning I know.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You don't know me.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't know me.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No one can know you better than we do.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's a door here!

Although we blocked the news at the first time,

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
all the platforms are still discussing the news of the missing person.

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The hot search is going to be held down.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Zhao Kaixuan, what the hell are you doing?

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Where did my son go?

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All the channels outside the passage are blocked.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mr. Wei, can you ask your daughter?

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
She was there when she was lost.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You mean my daughter hid them?

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
As the chief producer,

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you want to blame my daughter?

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You misunderstood.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I promise I'll give our show a perfect ending.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's not as simple as a show if you can't find it.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They're all better than me, right?

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They're all better than me.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is the radio gate still working?

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you going back to find them?

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's okay.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Go ahead.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't think we have to be together even if we like each other.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are your plans for the future?

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
My mom knows me well.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She made me a general.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a hero who could travel the world.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I could go anywhere.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I want to go to the island to see the sunset.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll be there wherever you are.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I like him, too.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Me, too.

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm good at surfing.

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We have big goals.

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's just say goodbye here.

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's my honor to meet you after I die.

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll leave first.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm afraid we'll never have a chance to separate again.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Actually...

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't move!

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why don't you come and say hello to me?

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are...

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can call me Mr. Zhao.

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can also call me Dad.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because I gave you five lives.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're the one who made this shameless show.

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't make this show.

87
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was made by market demand.

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm at most an executor.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let them go.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How much do you want?

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll let my mom give you.

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mr. Su.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What?

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You found the feeling of being a rich second generation now?

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You feel it?

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Your lives are not as simple as money.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Zhao.

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We're all in the entertainment industry.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Our only goal is to attract the audience.

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I believe the audience doesn't want to see the end of the show.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's a sad ending.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's what we're good at.

103
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right.

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So I'm not here to kill you.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not here to lock you up.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm here to ask you to go back.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
To complete the show.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And to give the audience a good time.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can cooperate.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But we five have to live.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If the dead die, it's the core of the show.

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We can't change that.

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Deceiving the audience is a big deal in the film industry.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But the audience wants to see us all alive.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's hard to say.

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No one can represent everyone.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But the rules are fine.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Everyone has a clear rule.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Just follow the rules.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I made every one of you.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I made you come back to life.

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I gave you a chance.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I made you get married.

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why can't you follow my rules?

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But it's our own consciousness.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why do you have you everywhere?

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you know how much I lost because of you?

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Stop talking.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In the end, there's just one more person.

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sorry.

131
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I owe you.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Su Xun.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Su Xun.

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you doing?

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Go back to the lab.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Zhao Yun.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The result of the show is only three hours away.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's too late to write the new film.

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No need to change it.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Except for Xiao Huchen,

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the memories of the other four people are selectively deleted.

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You provoked the others to run away, right?

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know the last one to die is you.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I've died once.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What am I afraid of?

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I let him run away.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll kill him if he's alive.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No need.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You have to live.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Look.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's how greedy people are.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When you're disabled,

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
you want a good body.

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
With a good body,

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you want good love.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Now you have to live well.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There's no such perfect life.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm telling you, Xiao Huchen.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The show will be over soon.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you don't die,

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
he's the one who will die.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Xiao Huchen.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I want you to watch the person you love die.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I want you to go to the head-cutting stage.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Put this on Xiao Huchen.

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is...

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't ask so much.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,700
Okay.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I won't.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now can youyou take it off?

174
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,000
Where should I put this on my back?

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
As you wish.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's just pretend DP has the way before.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's put it on.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't turn it off.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,100
pedestrians

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You see,

181
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm actually looking for somebody who can 1500 yen.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Am I right?

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm not sure.

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Who is it?

185
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,740
My heart is loving for you

186
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,820
We will give you

187
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,600
About an hour time

188
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,160
You will be unstable

189
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,980
Keep whatever you have

190
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,220
A solid smile, victory on the corner

191
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,760
The ground is clear

192
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,180
Never I will get lost

193
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,860
Move forward and never step behind

194
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,420
murders and murders

195
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
The heart should not change

196
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
The light is running

197
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
The heart is beating

198
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,420
The sea is shining

199
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
The dream is burning

200
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
The dream is burning

201
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,420
The light is burning

202
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,420
The sky is high. The heart is still.

203
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Steadfast smile. Victory is at the back feet.

204
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Feet. Feet.

205
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,420
The sky is high. The heart is still.

206
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
Steadfast smile. Victory is at the back feet.

207
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
The sky is high. The heart is still.

208
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,620
I'm not afraid of the strong smile

209
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,900
The strength is calling

210
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,620
The strength is in the heart

211
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,940
I'm not afraid of the strong smile

212
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,580
The strength is calling

213
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,940
The strength is in the heart

214
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,340
I'm not afraid of the strong will

215
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,820
The heart will not change

216
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,620
The strength is in the heart

217
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm not afraid of the strong will

218
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,860
The strong will not change

219
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,300
The heart will not change

220
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,380
The strength will not change

221
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,660
From beginning to end
