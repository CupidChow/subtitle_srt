00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Don't worry.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,500
Go and choose the person you like.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Rest well.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Go.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll get you some water.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
You must take it back.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
What did Anni and you say?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
You won't lie to me anymore, right?

10
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I'll get you some water.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll get you some water.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hello, I'm the chef.

13
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Today's soup is sweet.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll get you some water.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Help me find someone.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll get you some water.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Xiao Hou Chen,

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the original name is Chen Jian.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He's the son of the rebel Chen Gong.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's the son of the rebel Chen Gong.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So he's trying to revenge

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to get the princess in on purpose.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
He's not a righteous person.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Shut up.

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Su Xun found me.

26
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Su Xun, give me a break.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll get you some water.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
I can't let my mom and dad

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
come back to the car.

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I can't take it anymore.

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
You've been in the inn for half a month.

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You know each other well.

33
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
You can go out of the way

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
according to your wishes.

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
There's not much time left.

37
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I'll cherish it.

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Eunuch Ding.

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
When will General Su come back?

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Xiao Zhen is out of money.

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
I'll buy it.

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'll make it for you.

43
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I made it.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
It's better than buying it.

45
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Do you remember what you said last night?

46
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I was drunk last night.

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Do you remember

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
what you said to me?

49
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
General Su is back.

50
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
It's a promise.

51
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
It's a promise.

52
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Princess.

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
There's not much time left.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Please make a decision.

55
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Who will it be?

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
It's because there's not much time left.

57
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Shouldn't you threaten Princess now?

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
General Su.

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I have a way to make us all live.

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Princess means...

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
escape?

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Leave with me.

63
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Let's go to Beijing together.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I never escaped from the world.

65
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I never escaped.

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
As a local resident,

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I was a national guard.

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
How could Princess say

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
such a big thing?

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
But I hope

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
you can all live.

72
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Some people should die long ago.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Princess can even

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
save Princess's identity for her.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
She's still so stubborn.

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Do you know who she is?

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
General Su.

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
General Su.

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Where are you from?

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
She was the son of the most loyal official.

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
She was the one who gave the reward to the emperor

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
and served as the general of the country.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
But the Prime Minister found out

84
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
that the evidence of the success of the enemy

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
was finally revealed.

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Now Chen Jin,

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
the famous Xiao Houchen,

88
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
is in charge of the Wu Dan Inn.

89
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
He only has a father.

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
You've been using him

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
since you were a child.

92
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
So,

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
the enemy you want to revenge

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
is my father.

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Answer me!

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I hate people's lies the most.

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
除了杀人的志愿

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
如果我哭你的臉

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
你就会 flat-out belonged to the inferior lord and protect my body.

100
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
ISpeak to you,

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
the middle of the world

102
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
will be neither bed nor sun.

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Let's set out for a walk.

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Go get your gift to give Walkie-talkie.

105
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Right.

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
You...

107
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Is this not the world?

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Then those words you said to me

109
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I was blocked by me.

110
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
But it's all a misunderstanding.

111
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Let me be your wife.

112
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm really stupid.

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm really stupid.

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
You want me to give up on General Su

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
and let me see you kill my father and father.

116
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
From the beginning,

117
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
you think I'm a fool.

118
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Listen to me.

119
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
What?

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Can you tell me that everything is fake?

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
My lady.

122
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I don't want to get close to you.

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
My lady.

124
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Xiao Houchen, you've lost since you joined the Bureau.

125
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
My lady, don't worry.

126
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

127
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Why are you here?

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
This is the secret chamber.

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
You must be poisoned.

132
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Am I the kind of person

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
in your heart?

134
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
From the beginning of the Wudang Battle,

135
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
you were too mean to me.

136
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Isn't it because you hate me?

137
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
If he sent you to kill me,

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
do it.

139
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I really didn't like you at first.

140
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
But now, you want me to be your guard

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
and be my friend.

142
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
You're also a kind of person who is a fool.

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Now, no matter what I explain,

144
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
you won't believe me.

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Then stop talking.

146
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Do you know

147
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
what the taste of the throne of the family is?

148
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Your father killed my brother's family first.

149
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
He wanted to use you.

150
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
But he's already fallen in love with you.

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
He even died

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
and took the disease to save you.

153
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
If you really have the guts,

154
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
if you're heartless,

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
don't be a criminal.

156
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
This is the secret chamber.

157
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I won't kill you.

158
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Have some sweet.

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
You'll feel better.

160
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm not the reason for your trip.

161
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I'll return you to your family.

162
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,660
The man honest and withdrawn

163
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,180
differ in his attributes.

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
He is asは in our relationship.

165
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Like you

166
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
in hisizado and in his works.

167
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I can see it from the skin.

168
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
GMO and鏈hhhht

169
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I will not give up my revenge.

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Now I know it's good.

171
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
There is only me to choose this path for you.

172
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I won't let you die.

173
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
What should I do then?

174
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Ning'er.

175
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I will not let you die.

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I will not let you die.

177
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
I will not let you die.

178
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I will not let you die.

179
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
I will not let you die.

180
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
I will not let you die.

181
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Do you think I am dead or

182
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I hate you more than I hate you?

183
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
The army is in command.

184
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Take the prisoner and protect the city.

185
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Yes.

186
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
General Su.

187
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
You will leave the inn in five days.

188
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
You don't have to do that.

189
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I will not let you die.

190
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
