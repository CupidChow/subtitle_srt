00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,320
Who is this brother?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,880
You pretend to be in front of me.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,400
Do you really not remember my face?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,600
It turns out to be An Xiong.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,200
Xiao Mo has a free eye.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,520
I really can't see it.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,840
Brother Lin Siqian.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
You clearly promised that he would take care of me.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,840
But you are so innocent and useless.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,640
You are against my brother!

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,400
If you want to live,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,680
you'd better call me back.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,960
Call me back!

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,400
I'll leave now.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,400
If I call you back,

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,240
you can only call me back.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,880
Who asked you to come?

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,440
Chusucheng

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,720
Did I make a mistake?

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,000
Your Highness did not.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,400
I come here tonight to serve you.

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,560
Mr. Si Weixian where he turns lovely,

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,280
This game is for survival?

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Life is about survival.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
You have to fight for it.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Fight for it?

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
You're right.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
The End

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
I miss my Beijing so much.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
It's still the taste of the front line.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
It smells so good.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
General, do you have this kind of hand?

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm done. Please have a taste.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
You don't hate me?

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
I just met you.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Why do you hate me?

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Why don't you choose me today?

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
I just want to wait until 21.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
I'll be on the stage.

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,560
General, you're going to lose?

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm a 10-year-old general.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm a champion.

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
What's the point of fighting?

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Why do you want to fight first?

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
This is for a match.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Not a battle.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
A match is about survival.

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
What's the point of fighting?

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,560
This Su Xun is never close.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
I'll go out.

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm willing to marry you.

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
The battle is about survival.

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
But the enemy is not dead.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
My Su Xun is a warrior.

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
I'll never lose.

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
General, you should go to the Wudang Kachang.

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
When 21 is here,

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
I'll be on the stage.

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Su Xun is never close.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I'm willing to marry you.

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
It's water.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Water.

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Remember to come.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
General, my leg is numb.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Save me.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm in pain.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Don't go.

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
General, save me.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Where is he?

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
He's gone.

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm so angry.

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Why are you acting like this?

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
What's the purpose?

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Princess, are you there?

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm fine.

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Please go back.

78
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm so angry.

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm running away.

80
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Why am I still here?

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Who's asking for help?

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Xiao Chen.

83
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Don't save me.

84
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
General Su will save me.

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Let's go.

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Go.

87
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
You're a coward.

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
If he can save you,

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
you'll be in trouble.

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
No.

91
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Be careful.

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Why am I so worried?

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Why am I so worried?

94
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
You're a coward.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
You're so worried.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Don't be afraid.

97
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
I'll let the old thief

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
talk about the death of a person.

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
General Su,

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
you're so worried today.

101
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Xiao Chen.

102
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Don't save me.

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
How dare you!

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
What are you doing?

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
You were so angry just now.

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
You need to be careful.

107
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm also worried.

108
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
You...

109
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
can see it?

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
You...

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
You're a rabbit.

112
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Why are you acting like this?

113
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
What's the purpose?

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Princess.

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Princess.

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
How are you?

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Why did you act like this?

118
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Princess.

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Are you there?

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm fine.

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Please go back.

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Qi Jun is a big criminal.

123
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
If you want to live,

124
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
you need to die.

125
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
You're threatening me.

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm not.

127
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm asking you.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
You...

129
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
You...

130
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Princess.

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Choose one person.

132
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Kill him.

133
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
What's the purpose?

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
The rules of the inn

135
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
choose one person to live.

136
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Then choose one to die.

137
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Yes.

138
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
If you break the rules,

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
you're wrong.

140
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
You're guilty.

141
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I'm afraid you can't bear it.

142
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Princess, save me.

143
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Qi Jun is a big criminal.

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
You're a criminal.

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Princess, be careful.

146
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Why do I feel like Xiao Houchen is a bit familiar?

147
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Princess.

148
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
If you don't choose,

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
you'll be killed.

150
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
You're the one who can die.

151
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
It's my honor.

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Unfortunately,

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I can't cure Princess's illness.

154
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
I just need a cure.

155
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
You're threatening me again.

156
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
For her,

157
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
I'll leave her to you.

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
If you don't choose,

159
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
you'll be killed again.

160
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Okay.

161
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
I'll take the risk.

162
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Tomorrow,

163
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
I'll be the first to be killed.

164
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I'll be the second to be killed.

165
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
I'll be the first to be killed.

166
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
If I win,

167
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
I'll be the first to be killed.

168
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
If I'm destroyed,

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
you'll be killed.

170
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
You want to be the first to be killed?

171
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
You have to choose.

172
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I'll leave her to you.

173
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
I'll be the first to be killed.

174
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
You're a criminal.

175
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
You're threatening me again.

176
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
You're threatening me again.

177
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll be the first to be killed.

178
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
I won't be the first to be killed.

179
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Master An.

180
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I'll send you back.

181
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
If I can't,

182
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,720
It must be Wang Qing Baba,

183
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
that he turned part of the Xu blood

184
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,220
through the yo-yo hotel

185
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,260
that Huicao

186
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,740
playing with me?

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,000
Ling Meng's

188
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
Central 얼굴

189
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,840
of the current

190
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,020
of theale

191
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,400
is she yours

192
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,120
You can't be what you really think

193
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,080

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,480
Close your hair.

195
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Why did you come here?

196
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,880

197
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,880

198
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,080

202
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,840
I don't need to be with you.

203
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,560

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080

212
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,160

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,880

216
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,680

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,280
he'll be a fool.

222
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,440

224
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,240
I haven't given you the bill.

225
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,280
What do you want?

226
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,880

227
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,080
You're a thief.

228
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
You came to me.

229
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,680

232
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,840
