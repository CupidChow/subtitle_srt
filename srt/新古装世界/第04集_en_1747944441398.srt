00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Aikachan is a liar.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,000
No one can take it seriously.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Sister, let's go.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
I said no more coming, Miss An.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who is it?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,600
Princess, you have to escape from the Wudang Kachan.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The princess of Wudang Kachan is here.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who was that?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
General Su, you misunderstood.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It was Xiao Mo's illness.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then why did you have to fight with the princess?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I have a free mother.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was in the same illness with the woman.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then I got a few treatment together.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I never did anything wrong.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How could you misunderstand me?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, General Su.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's obvious that the princess is in love with you.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How could you be so heartless?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I saw it clearly just now.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Young Master, I'm a little bored.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to go back and rest.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll go back with you.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What else do you want?

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's go.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It seems that the princess is not ill.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you for your help.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I almost got fooled by Miss.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Miss, you really like General Su?

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I like the close-up of the heart.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't care about the little things.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to be with him.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I want to spend my life with you.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I advise you.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I advise you.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't waste your energy on me.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's just to admit to the Prime Minister.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll spend my life with you.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's worth it.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't understand.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're a scholar and a scholar.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You must have been in the palace for a long time.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now the marriage is not easy.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's important for the princess.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's worth it for the Prime Minister.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's worth it.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Su family is the general world.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a small girl.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If I can be a general,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll be a good woman.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll thank you and my father.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And you're not blind.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're a rich man.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's the point?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If I tell you the truth,

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you'll change your mind.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then you'd better not say it.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Stop it.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're really a good scholar.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
An Ning.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Help me.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What's the point?

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Help me.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Turn the wall.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The princess really wants to escape.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll explain to you later.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come on.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Great.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come on.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm coming.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come on.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Princess.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can see it?

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How can you let the princess go out alone?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm the only woman left in the inn.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So you can only choose me.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Take me back and fight with you.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
An Ning.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why are you everywhere?

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't be afraid.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sister.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll cure you.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll...

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Strange.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's a big king outside the wilderness.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Xiao Feng.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I...

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Water.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Water.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Are you afraid of water?

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll take you there.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come on.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why are you here?

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm here to save you.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm here to protect you.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not afraid.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But you.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why are you afraid of water?

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not afraid of water.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's no water here.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Miss is afraid of water.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Duan Chang Cao.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I found it.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Look.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's Duan Chang Cao.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's wrong?

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's Chudu.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ning, go to my room and get the needle.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The princess is poisoned.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You need to take the needle and seal it.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Take the poison out.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The princess is so warm.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why is she poisoned?

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You poisoned her.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You need to save her first.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Otherwise, the poison will not be fully recovered.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
General.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't blame me.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Coming.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please leave.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want the needle.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You want to keep the poison in the room with the princess?

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The needle is in the back of the princess.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You need to take off your clothes.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A man and a woman can't be separated?

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm the doctor.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She's my patient.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's more?

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What's more?

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
She's blind.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She can't see.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you want to see me die?

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's important to save people.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's go.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Have you come up with 편 maths?

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
General,

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
do you have any thoughts?

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was постоян.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How do you feel about the ladies?

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
An Ning?

162
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
If it's a boy,

163
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,320
I'll marry him.

164
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,600
What a pity.

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,560
By the way,

166
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
I haven't found

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,960
a matchmaker

168
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
with me.

169
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,520
Xiao Hu Chen?

170
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
What about you, Princess?

171
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,520
General Su,

172
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,000
I have a plan.

173
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,720
I often check the story of Luo Ting.

174
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,120
When I see her,

175
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,760
she's really a little girl.

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,000
I fell in love with her.

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,920
She likes me?

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,680
I haven't had a good time with her.

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,760
How do you feel?

180
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
What's the rush?

181
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
There's a man

182
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
who's loyal to me.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,160
Princess, you're off.

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,440
Go back.

185
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,680
I'm worried about you.

186
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
I'll give you some medicine

187
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,160
to cure your fever.

188
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,240
You're still in love with me?

189
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,240
You shouldn't be here.

190
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I heard that

191
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,400
you're a new general.

192
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
Now it seems that

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,920
