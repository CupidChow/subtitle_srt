1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
The First Lady of the Martial Arts Club

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,960
Episode 1

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
Su Xun, what are you doing?

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,000
The Princess finally called my name.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,360
You haven't left the Martial Arts Club yet.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,360
Why do you care about me?

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,280
You forgot the rules of the Martial Arts Club.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,760
Don't forget.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
You were the one who called me first.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,960
I will send the Princess back to the Prime Minister's Mansion

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,040
in person in five days.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,160
Hey!

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,400
You!

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,680
Let me out!

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,240
Su Xun!

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,820
Don't be rude.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
instructed Umbrellas

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,740
According to the rules of the Martial Arts Club,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,980
You political-arti

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,240
Theyимange

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,380
Lord Su!

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,000
How could you tell that I say that you wanted to see me?

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,960
You do have nothe Artillery Lady in duke's case.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,020
Thank you for everything.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,940
The President of the Haunted School

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,720
has died in the Tekken of the World.

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,760
And the time ahead

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,080
is now independent.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,600
We can't get rid of you,

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
An Ning!

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
An Ning!

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Su Xing, let me out!

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Even if you die today,

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
you can't save her.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
You can't save Xiao Houchen.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
You're the one who loves her.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
You can't save her.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Now that Xiao Houchen is caught,

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I and Princess Jia Ou Tian Cheng

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
can make you and An Ning together.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
I saved you, Yu Yan.

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
You should thank me.

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
If anything happens to me,

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I'll never let you down.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Princess Jia Ou Tian Cheng is Xiao Houchen.

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
If she dies because of you,

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
she will be sad.

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
How can a person like her

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
be called Jia Ou Tian Cheng?

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Get your skin!

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Su Xing!

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Stop!

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Stop!

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
What do you think?

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Princess is just confused.

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
As long as she's by my side,

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'll make her fall in love with me.

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Let her live her life

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and live her life to the fullest.

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
You're a man who's broken into a red building.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
How dare you stop me?

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Keep an eye on them.

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Yes.

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You're guilty of Xiao Houchen's crime.

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Cheng Xiao is dead again.

66
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I knew you were busy that day.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I shouldn't have let you go.

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I let you go.

69
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
President Zhao, President Zhao.

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Did the dagger in the Demon Flower

71
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
fall into the garden?

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,960
New Year's Eve

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Zhousi.

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Give me a click.

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It's nothing new.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Man is someone who doesn't feel very good about it.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It's Zhang Zhousi.

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Zhang Zhousi.

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Give me a click.

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
We'll have to go too.

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Prime Ministerまず.

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Pretend like it's nothing.

83
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I'll die.

84
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
This is so scary.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
It's so scary.

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
What should we do next?

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Water.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Water for him.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes.

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Water.

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Wake up.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
How are you?

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Wake up.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Wake up.

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I was so confused.

96
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Hu Chen.

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
It's because of the rescue.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Dr. Lin.

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I've said it many times.

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm a resident of the Xiaofang Garden.

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
The savior is my angel.

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I have nothing to do with the savior.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
As long as you're willing,

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'll be with you forever.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Okay?

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
My ball.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Let's go to the garden.

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Let's go to play.

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Uncle Xiao.

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Dr. Lin likes you, doesn't he?

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
No.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's because you like Dr. Lin.

114
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
But you don't deserve it.

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Let's go to the garden.

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Dr. Lin.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't push.

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
I can do it myself.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
It's so late.

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Why are we going?

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
You'll know when we get there.

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Be careful.

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
What's going on?

124
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
It's okay.

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
It's okay.

126
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It's bleeding.

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Hurry up.

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Hurry up.

129
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
It's okay.

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
It's moving.

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
It's almost done.

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
It's not moving.

133
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Hurry up.

134
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
It's moving.

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Don't move.

136
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Don't push.

137
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Push.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Push.

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Push.

140
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Don't push.

141
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Dad, what are you doing?

142
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Dad.

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Don't hurt yourself.

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Yue.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Yue.

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Don't die.

147
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Yue.

148
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Mom, stay here.

149
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
There's a shadow here.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I'm leaving.

151
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
What are you doing? Let go of me.

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Why did you save me?

153
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Don't you hate me?

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
When did the reunion?

155
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I just hope that there's a chance.

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Hurry up.

157
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I won't be revenge.

158
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I won't hurt your father.

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I won't hurt you.

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Come with me.

161
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I tried to save you,

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
but it doesn't mean that

163
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I forgive you.

164
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I'll go get them back.

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Yes.

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Mr. Zhao.

167
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Every body is valuable.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
And the show hasn't finished yet.

169
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
It's too much.

170
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Let them go.

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
It's even more painful.

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Mr. Zhao.

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Why don't you let Ding Gonggu try it?

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I'll go get it.

175
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll go get it.

176
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Do you like me?

177
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I've never liked you.

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
If you lie again,

179
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
what are you going to do?

180
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Let's leave here together.

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Leave this ancient world

182
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
and let them go together.

183
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
What ancient world?

184
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Don't move.

185
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Xiao Houchen.

186
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
How dare you!

187
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Since you're the princess of the Four Seasons,

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
you forgot the rule of the Wu-Dan Kexan.

189
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Ding Gonggu.

190
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I hope you can let her go.

191
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I can go back with you to the Kexan.

192
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
What's the key to the house?

193
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I'll kill you.

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
My little girl.

195
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
You want my life, right?

196
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
His Majesty has already given Xiao Houchen a special leave.

197
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
We're here to take you back.

198
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
It's a letter.

199
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
But General Su...

200
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
His Majesty has given a special leave.

201
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Who dares to stop him?

202
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
His Majesty said

203
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
that the general Chen of the Chen Palace

204
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
was still in love with him.

205
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
He must be happy to be the one

206
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
who investigated this matter.

207
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Why are you staring at me?

208
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
You've been staring at me for 24 hours.

209
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
You're not staring at me anymore.

210
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Xiao Houchen and Cheng Cao Yue are really close now.

211
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Why are you looking at me?

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
What's wrong?

213
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
What's wrong?

214
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
What's wrong with you?

215
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
What's wrong with you?

216
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
What's wrong with you?

217
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
The road is steep.

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
The heart doesn't change.

220
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
The wind blows.

221
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
The wind blows.

222
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
The sun shines.

223
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
The dream is in the hands of the people.

224
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
The dream is in the hands of the people.

225
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
The dream is in the hands of the people.

226
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
The dream is in the hands of the people.

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
The wind blows.

228
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
The coldness in my heart.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
The smile is delicious.

230
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
The black cloud makes me drunk

231
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
The victory is in the rear corner

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,300
The arrow is in the heart

233
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,600
Don't be afraid of being swayed

234
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,900
The firm smile is in the rear corner

235
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,600
The arrow is in the heart

236
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,900
Don't be afraid of being swayed

237
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,600
The moving smile is in the rear corner

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,900
The arrow is in the heart

239
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,200
Don't be afraid of being swayed

240
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,300
The cold wind is strong

241
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,800
The heart is not changing

242
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,600
The arrow is in the heart

243
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,100
Don't be afraid of being swayed

244
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,900
The moving wind is not changing

245
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,400
The heart is not changing

246
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,900
The heart is not changing

247
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,400
The heart is not changing

248
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,900
The heart is not changing
