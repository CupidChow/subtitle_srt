1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You! I'm done!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Please let me have a look.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
You're so good at playing the game.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm so bad at this.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
He doesn't want to. Don't you understand?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Who is this?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Go and deal with him.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No need. This is Director Wei's daughter.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
She's the fan of the girl who gave birth to him.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Just watch her. Don't do anything big.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
Mute

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,860
Deserve to become a CondOM

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,260
You don't even look at me.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,660
You look so much like you're not even talking to her.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,460
No matter how much you play the role of a play, I'm not polite to you.

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,860
You dare to touch me? Do you know who I am?

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,860
You're so mean. I'll bite you.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,260
You guys are all going to be beaten up.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
I don't care who you are.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,860
As long as I'm here, you can't touch me.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,860
Sir, you're wrong. I'll take you to someone else.

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,860
What are you doing? I'm not leaving.

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,660
Let's go.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,860
Let me deal with you!

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
Let's go.

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,860
Did the box of the woman that she just gave you?

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,860
She...

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,860
She came again?

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,860
She's acting like a fox.

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,860
I'm afraid that I'll be too scared.

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,860
No matter how much I grow up,

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,860
even though I'm a person who likes to make me happy,

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,860
I'm only a person who's a little bit too humble.

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,860
I've seen too many of your compared and risks.

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,860
I've also been too humiliated.

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,860
You're the first one to protect me.

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Don't lie to me.

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Father, wake up.

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
How are you?

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Xuan.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,860
It's me. I brought medicine.

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,860
Don't move.

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Have a good rest.

45
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
After you finish your medicine, I'll go to bed.

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
Did the lady trust me?

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
You...

48
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,860
Don't talk nonsense.

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,860
Then why are you so quick-witted?

50
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Why did you save me?

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,860
Why did you send me medicine?

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
An An.

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
You're a little cold today.

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
I brought medicine.

55
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Close the door.

56
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,860
You even forgot your gift.

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,860
No one taught me.

58
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,860
You like to be close to her and make her happy.

59
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,860
You don't care about the private life.

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
You want to be with her.

61
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
This is not what I like.

62
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
I didn't mean that.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm not like that.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
I'm not like that.

65
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm not like that.

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,860
I'm not like that.

67
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
I'm not like that.

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
I'm not like that.

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
You're dressed up today?

70
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Are you not lying to me?

71
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Fu Chou is a fake.

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
He likes you.

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm not.

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Then why didn't you kill the Prime Minister?

75
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Or you just killed the Prime Minister?

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
Why are you here?

77
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Did you forget my brother?

78
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
I didn't forget.

79
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
I was so cruel that I thought it was Brother Xiao who saved me.

80
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
It's hard to forget the person who saved me.

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,860
But you promised me that you would take care of me.

82
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Ning'er.

83
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,860
I don't want to drag you down this path.

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,860
I was thinking that I would take you with me when I finish this.

85
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
If I knew that you had been through so much,

86
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
I would have brought you to me.

87
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Now that I've met you,

88
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
I will take good care of you.

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,860
But I know that you're my sister.

90
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
But I just want to be with you.

91
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,860
You and I don't have much time to get along.

92
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
Are you really loyal to me?

93
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,860
Or are you just not willing to let me leave you?

94
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
I don't know.

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Ning'er.

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

97
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,860
You must think of a way to leave the inn alive.

98
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,860
It's better to choose the right way.

99
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
If you don't like it,

100
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,860
I will kill them and ask you what you want to learn from them.

101
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
I don't need it.

102
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,860
Do you have someone you like now?

103
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
No.

104
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,860
What do you think of Xiao Houchen and Zhou Pipa?

105
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Why should I answer you?

106
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
You're so stupid.

107
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
If you don't answer me, you're a resistance.

108
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Come on.

109
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
Wait.

110
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,860
I think Xiao Houchen is more like a brother.

111
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Zhou Pipa.

112
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Zhou Pipa?

113
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
The suit is still in the drawer.

114
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
I will marry General Su.

115
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Next.

116
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Fortunately, you still believe me.

117
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Frankly, I still believe you.

118
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
You really think you know what to do with theively theuns?

119
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
Tell me.

120
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Stop shaking.

121
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,860
OK, alright.

122
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
Mr. Zhao, you are a businessman too.

123
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
I want to repeat some conditions.

124
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,860
At first, I was free to provide you a shooting location.

125
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,860
I wanted my son Su Xun to come back alive.

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Mr. Su, you are still early in the final decision.

127
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
Su Xun will definitely come back alive.

128
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
My son is so excellent.

129
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
What have you all taken?

130
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
What Su Han Han?

131
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
General Ji Tui?

132
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Su Xun used to like to eat roasted chicken legs.

133
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,860
My son never ate those rubbish food.

134
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,860
He only likes to eat what I cook.

135
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I don't just want him to come back,

136
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
but also to make him happy.

137
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
Understand?

138
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
Yes.

139
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,860
My son, I will definitely let you come back alive.

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,860
Mr. Su, there is nothing to say about this.

141
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,860
No one is willing to listen to you.

142
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
I dare to.

143
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
How dare you!

144
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
I know that a person with a lot of money is expensive.

145
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Hurry up and leave.

146
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Say it.

147
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Hurry up and leave.

148
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Brother Xiao.

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
You clearly have a vision.

150
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,860
How to protect yourself from the enemy.

151
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Could it be that you can see it?

152
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
I can't see it.

153
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
I can't see it.

154
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I can't see it.

155
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
I can't see it.

156
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
I can't see it.

157
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
I can't see it.

158
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
I can't see it.

159
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
I can't see it.

160
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
I can't see it.

161
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
I can't see it.

162
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
I can't see it.

163
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,860
I can't see it.

164
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,860
I can't see it.

165
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I can't see it.

166
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,860
I cannot see it.

167
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
I can't see it.

168
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
I can't see it.

169
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,860
I can't see it.

170
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,860
I can't see it.

171
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I can't see it.

172
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,860
I can't see it.

173
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I can't see it.

174
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
Bro, whyUNG.

175
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
No way.
