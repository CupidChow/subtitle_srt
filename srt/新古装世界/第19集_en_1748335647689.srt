1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ni'er

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do you think I'm dead or hurt?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Or do you hate the one you love more?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,360
For you

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,160
Well, damn, I'm gonna eat

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Plop

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,000
Damn right

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We are the vegans

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
So I will sell you

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
I, too

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,960
Now you will see

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:19,920
Below the line is Chew, I'm

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,580
white and white is not an obvious norm and

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,580
We met each other and we were always together.

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,780
Now, I know you must protect your brother.

17
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,980
Before death, I can meet my friend,

18
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,980
meet Zhiying,

19
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,980
and the girl I love.

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm afraid I have no regrets.

21
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,780
Don't be sad, girl.

22
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
I'll sing a song for you.

23
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,180
I'm here

24
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,980
to sing a song for you.

25
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,940
My soul.

26
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:40,680
As Busy Liu

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm afraid I won't let you make it difficult for you.

28
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Ni'er,

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
do you mean I'm a fool

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
or a heart-broken person?

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
After all,

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
I've never seen a man

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
who has been so wise.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
I've never seen a man who has been so wise.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
My Lady.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
What?

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Are you going to do it?

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
You promised to go to Beijing.

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
You even made a wish.

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
You will give up Fu Cheng.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
You hate me for what you did.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
You don't need to do it.

53
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
I don't hate you.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
You're right.

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
You're still going to kill me?

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
You'll have to wait

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
until I take you to my manor

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
and kill my father.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
My Lady.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
My Lady.

61
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
It's a promise.

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
No matter what happens,

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
I hope you can take care of me.

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
We'll be together

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
for a long time.

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Don't touch me.

67
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Don't touch me.

68
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
I've never seen a man

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
who has been so wise.

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
If you can keep me company,

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
I'll take care of you.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,680
I'll be with you on the way.

74
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
I'll be with you on the way.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
I'll be with you on the way.

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I'll get the medicine for you.

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
I'll do it myself.

78
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
You can get the medicine for Xiao Hou Chen,

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
but you're trying to hide it from me.

80
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Which one is better for you?

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
You're right.

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
He can't compare to you.

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
But why does she

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
have a heart like yours?

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
It can't be me.

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I won't go back.

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I was willing to go to the country

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
because you asked me to.

89
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
But I couldn't stop loving others

90
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
for half a month.

91
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
I wasn't afraid to die,

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
but I was a rebel.

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm sure he's the one.

94
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,680
If I can live with you,

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I'll protect you.

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Thank you, General Su.

97
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm a little tired.

98
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
I'll be there at night.

99
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
If anything happens,

100
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
I'll be fine.

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
You're so disappointed.

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Now General Su

103
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
knows your identity.

104
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
You'll know it soon.

105
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
I'll handle it myself.

107
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
If that's the case,

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
I can't protect you anymore.

109
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
From now on,

110
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
you can't come to me again.

111
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Your Majesty,

112
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll take care of it.

113
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
For the sake of the future,

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
please don't make things difficult for me.

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

116
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
General Su,

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
General Chengxing has been waiting for you here for a long time.

118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Greetings, General Chengxing.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
General Su, please have a seat.

120
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I don't know why you're looking for me.

121
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
General Su,

122
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
you know that

123
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I've always been thinking about the country.

124
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
So,

125
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
that Chen Jin

126
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
is a very good person.

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
I'm sure he'll be able to help you.

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Chen Jin

129
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
is a very good person.

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
You must think it through.

131
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm willing to die.

132
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
I'm afraid that I'll die without regret.

133
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm willing to die without regret.

134
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
General Su, take it.

135
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Go away.

136
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
General Su,

137
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
please take care of everyone.

138
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
What do you think?

139
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
The general is listening.

140
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Yes.

141
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Arrest the rebels and detain the officials.

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Yes.

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
General Su,

144
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
you'll leave the inn in five days.

145
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
You don't have to do that.

146
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm finally the country,

147
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
and His Majesty.

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I'm finally the country,

149
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
and His Majesty.

150
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
I'm finally the country,

151
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
and His Majesty.

152
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I'm finally His Majesty.

153
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I'm the duty of protecting the country

154
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
and helping the Anpang.

155
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Why did you stop me?

156
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
If you want to arrest me,

157
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
then you need to get rid of me.

158
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Ning'er,

159
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
who dares to do this?

160
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
He's trying to kill Prime Minister.

161
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Princess, do you want to leave your own father

162
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
for a rebel?

163
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I'm a man.

164
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm not a man.

165
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I'm not a man.

166
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I haven't met

167
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
his court.

168
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
General Su,

169
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
you should take care of my personal affairs.

170
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
This matter is not about personal affairs,

171
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
but about the country.

172
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Stop!

173
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
I dare you to do this!

174
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Let me go!

175
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Be careful!

176
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Let me go!

177
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Don't touch me!

178
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Let her go!

179
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Xiao Houchen,

180
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
two women

181
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
have been killed for you.

182
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
You even sent her away?

183
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Let her go.

184
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I'll go with you.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Take her away.

186
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Hand over Prime Minister's position.

187
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Yes.

188
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Lock her up in the cellar

189
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
and listen to her.

190
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Young Master.

191
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Listen to her.

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Prime Minister!

193
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Princess,

194
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm sorry to have made you lose your mind.

195
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I'll take you back to rest.

196
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Princess!

197
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
I dare you to do this!

198
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
I dare you to do this!

199
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
General Su,

200
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
what are you doing?

201
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Princess finally

202
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
has a name for you.

203
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
She's not leaving the Wu Dan Inn.

204
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Why are you so reckless?

205
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Princess,

206
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
you forgot the rules of the Wu Dan Inn.

207
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Don't forget it.

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Let's talk to the Chief first.

209
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
After the day ends,

210
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
I'll personally go to the Wu Dan Inn.

211
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Go.

215
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Don't be afraid of being far away.

216
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
I can't move my heart.

217
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
My heart won't change.

218
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
My heart won't change.

219
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Everything changes.
