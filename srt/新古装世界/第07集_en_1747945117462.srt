Be careful!

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Be careful!

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're the one I'm looking for.

Look at him,

I.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,640
am less than ten years old,

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,200
respected the world,

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
with the gift of a yearning and a good day,

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,540
you have become the bomb

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,540
of your desire.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,440
Hope our new world

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
will have ever real life.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the sun, the light shines on the sky

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All hope is in the world

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want it

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will give you the life of the five of you

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I want you to be my life

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will be with you

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to see your love die tomorrow

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want it

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't live anymore

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wu Xiyu

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The next episode

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The next episode

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The new child is chosen

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Brother

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can they be opened by the current memory of Feng Yin?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Go back to your friends

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You have to rely on them

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Congratulations

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Congratulations

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Congratulations

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Congratulations

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I am here

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The fifth episode

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The five of you have not played the game yet

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a game

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
OK, the show must be on the line

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Today's rules are reversed

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The young master who wins

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can choose the girl who is kind

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Say it, what is the game today?

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The game

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mr. Ding

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The game is the game of the game

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am the best

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I am the best

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tongwei is a man

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's the harm?

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait for me

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Xiao Houchen, what are you waiting for?

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you can't see it, we can help you

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, Ding

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't go down

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mr. Ding, this game is not fair

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If someone goes down

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then I can only listen to the god

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr. Ding, don't face me

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Qiuqiu, you are so short

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Zhou Pipa wins

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Ding, you choose first

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who do you want me to choose?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Princess, this is the Yangmei wine I bought

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a decoction

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have a try

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You are so kind

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't drink wine

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you do?

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I climb trees

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are so weak

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How can you climb trees?

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You are wrong

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am talking about the books

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Princess, I will train with you

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will keep you safe

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you, General Su

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is that?

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The one who knows me is so kind

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The one who doesn't know me is so drunk

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He is drunk for me

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He is not sleepy for others

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I choose you

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What is written?

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
General Su, let's drink

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is it late?

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will help you

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You are still by my side

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Be careful

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Princess, it's you

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Princess, how can you drink it?

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What if it is poisoned?

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You and I are both in your hands

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why do I hurt you?

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
General Su, how can you be so arrogant?

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
General Su, it's just a few things

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You really have a good taste

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have a good taste

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I have been a doctor

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
for many years

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have been in the world

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you can cure it

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are a doctor

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Since I used your medicine

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I am much better

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
General Su

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Please invite Mr. Xiao to drink

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Brother

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good power

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sorry, I lost my hand at the right time

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why don't you change your clothes in the inn?

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No need

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think you won't mind

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
seeing your clothes

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course not

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I won't leave then

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Princess

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Princess

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The battle of the White Mountain was very dangerous

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I only used 5,000 troops

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to kill the enemy army

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's not a good idea

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Brother

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You come to try the stone lock

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, I am not feeling well today

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am not as good as you

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I am so ashamed

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Come on, brother

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Come on

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The stone is too light

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I am so worried about the food

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think there must be fish in the lake

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why don't we catch the fish together

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and give it to the princess

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
General Su

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't take Xiao Meng

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Xiao Meng's eyes are not visible

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How can I see the fish

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
General Su

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
General Su

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
General Su

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What are you doing

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Princess

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't believe him

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Xiao Chen, you did it on purpose

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't pretend

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's okay

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Xiao Chen

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait for me

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Come and have a look

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Come in

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Be good

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why don't you go in

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let go

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Miss An

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Come in

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Come in

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You asked me to choose you last night

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I choose you

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You choose who

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you choose Xiao Xiu

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will choose the princess

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let go

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I will go

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I will go

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I have recovered my makeup

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have to make up

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You are more excited

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't move

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Look at me

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are so pretty

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why did you try to wear a man's makeup

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Of course it's convenient to be a standard

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Miss, for the sake of your life

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Please do some tricks on the sword

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Miss will not let you

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Be with me

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Miss will not let you

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Be with me

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You are so pretty

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I am afraid that I will sing a song for you

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Who said I will be with you

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You are so afraid of death

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why do you come to the dance class

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a person who loves me

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But he is worried about me

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Will be implicated in his reputation

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Famous is the most useless thing in the world

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So only Miss

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Will be with me

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And me

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am rich

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You touched me

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Do you know who I am

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I leave the class

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You are so great

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You are lying

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Rich is fake

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like the princess

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I am useless

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why don't you kill the Prime Minister

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Or just marry the Prime Minister

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will find you a brother

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you forgetting me

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You are so beautiful

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
