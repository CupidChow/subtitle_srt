1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,440
'.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,200
Or except the most recent approval?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,640
And, everybody's made a duct tape.

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,700
Are you sure?

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,580
Enough.

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,300
That makes juice, then what now?

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,000
GНу,ır's Twitter's website

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
Don't leave.

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,760
The rapOUM is just Dawang's.

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,560
What?

11
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,940
You just talk.

12
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,940
I didn't hear it.

13
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,940
I said I like you.

14
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
Congratulations!

15
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Congratulations!

16
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Good!

17
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
Who is it?

18
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Who is it?

19
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
You were here just now.

20
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
Where is he?

21
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
Who are you?

22
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Is he looking for me?

23
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Brother, you are so handsome today.

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
Thank you.

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,940
The concert is over today.

26
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
Thank you for coming to see me.

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Congratulations!

28
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,940
Congratulations!

29
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,940
Let's go.

30
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
Goodbye, Brother Fatty.

31
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
Goodbye, Brother.

32
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Goodbye, Mom.

33
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Look, they can't bear to see me.

34
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
Look at how much my brother likes you.

35
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,940
I didn't expect the concert to be so interesting.

36
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
As long as you think about it,

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
I'm willing to watch the concert for the rest of my life.

38
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
Thank you.

39
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
I'm going back first.

40
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
Did you hear me send your song?

41
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
I heard it.

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Sister heard it.

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
It's even louder than me.

44
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,940
I didn't.

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
I knew it.

46
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
You must fall in love with him

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,940
when you watch the concert.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,940
You two must be together.

49
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
You must choose my brother.

50
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,940
You two are really great.

51
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,940
You must live in the bullet train station.

52
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,940
I'm going now.

53
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Bye-bye.

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Let's go together.

55
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
Did you buy this?

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Of course not.

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,940
You're too strong to bear to see me.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,940
I'm afraid that I'll die

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
if I can share my love with others.

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm going back.

61
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
Let's go.

62
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,940
I'm afraid that I'm a fool.

63
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
I'm just a fool.

64
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,940
If I can be free,

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
I'll be more beautiful

66
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,940
and more beautiful.

67
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,940
I'm sure you have something in mind.

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,940
If we get married,

69
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,940
I'll be more beautiful.

70
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,940
I'll take you there.

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,940
Why haven't you married yet?

72
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,940
How can I be married

73
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
if I can't get revenge?

74
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
My father was a firecracker.

75
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
He was a politician.

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
He was a farmer.

77
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
He was a farmer.

78
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
The people around him

79
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
trusted him a lot.

80
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
But my father

81
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
was a firecracker.

82
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,940
He was a murderer.

83
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,940
He was a murderer.

84
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,940
I was 15 years old that year.

85
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
Those days,

86
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
I must have been very hard to get.

87
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
That day,

88
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
I didn't know that I was a firecracker.

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,940
That boss

90
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,940
is really not a thing.

91
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
He wanted to return

92
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
the money he had.

93
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Maybe he gave it back to me.

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
Do you

95
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,940
want to go to Beijing?

96
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
If I can leave the inn,

97
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,940
if I can get revenge for my father,

98
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,940
I won't be able to get over Beijing.

99
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
If you can't get revenge,

100
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,940
do you want to go?

101
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Zanzi, Zanzi.

102
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Zanzi, you look good.

103
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
Sir, here's a piece.

104
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Thank you.

105
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
Where are you going?

106
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
I have something to tell you.

107
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Zanzi, Zanzi.

108
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Mr. Zhao,

109
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
the number of people in the Zhou Pipa

110
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
has exceeded all the people.

111
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Mr. Zhao,

112
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
our clean-up rate

113
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,940
has reached the top of the history.

114
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,940
Fu Xi,

115
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
if you were a person,

116
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
you could drink with me.

117
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
But it's a pity that

118
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
no one is a pity.

119
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,940
How about I make you a body of a relative?

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
I'm not here.

127
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
Don't be afraid.

128
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Open the river.

129
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
No.

130
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Zhao,

131
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
we drink.

132
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Let's take this clean-up rate.

133
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Don't be ridiculous.

134
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Yes.

135
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,940
I'll let them relax tomorrow.

136
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I'll let them relax tomorrow.

137
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Everyone,

138
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,940
we've been here for half a month.

139
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,940
Please enjoy your meal.

140
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Mr. Huang has been here for hundreds of years.

141
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
Why are you all standing here?

142
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,940
Eat.

143
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
Mr. Ding, be careful.

144
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Remember.

145
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,940
Come.

146
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
You're not a good singer.

147
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Come and help me.

148
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I'll help you.

149
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Put on a general's price at the Wudang Inn.

150
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Put on a good voice.

151
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Put on a good voice.

152
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Okay.

153
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm not a singer.

154
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
But you know how to sing.

155
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Sing?

156
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Why don't we play a little bit?

157
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,940
You can ask any question to the audience.

158
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
Only you two know.

159
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,940
The answer is to answer loudly.

160
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,940
If anyone wants to know the right question,

161
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
you can ask yourself.

162
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,940
You can ask Xiao Houchen to answer.

163
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
No.

164
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,940
Will you take me to the Beijing?

165
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,940
Yes.

166
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
General,

167
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,940
only those who want to know the right question need to drink.

168
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm happy.

169
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Have you ever thought about

170
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,940
what kind of life I would have?

171
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,940
I've thought it over.

172
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
I want to be myself.

173
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
I want to be myself.

174
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Princess, it's your turn.

175
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Do you want to go with me?

176
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,940
Yes.

177
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
Princess, what did you do to her?

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
I asked her

179
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
if she wanted to drink with me.

180
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Well, Zhuzhe,

181
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
you asked too much.

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
This game is so fun.

183
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
Who do you like the most?

184
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Can I drink with you?

185
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
You can.

186
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,940
But I'm not the princess I know.

187
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
What did you ask her?

188
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
I asked her

189
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
if she wanted to drink with me.

190
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
What's wrong with you?

191
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
I want to go with you.

192
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
What's wrong with you?
