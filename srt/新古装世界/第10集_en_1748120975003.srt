1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Please give me the medicine.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Do you want to judge the place where the knife is hit first?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The lady will take it.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know why.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm very familiar with it.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
See you, buddy.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Smaller happiness

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,840
Curses

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,120
The Posk Common man

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,080
I was at your service

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,240
How could it not hurt

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,040
sorry

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Is that useful

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,120
Mother

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,200
Don't rid me of�

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,040
You don't lie

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
If you are really at a disadvantage

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
I should take out the unique flower of the whole world.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
As long as I drink it, everything will be fine.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
An Ning, go out.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
An Ning doesn't know how to be polite.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Princess, don't mind.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I will go back and take care of the family.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
It's okay.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
He is also good for you.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,040
As for the flower of the choice, I will think of a way.

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,740
Tomorrow atまた in next life,

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
command the grandmother and daughter-in-law

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,540
You suffered the heavy injury because of the injuries.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,540
Can you survive this?

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Don't fight for me.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Miss Shi saved me.

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,440
I told you

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
to keep the flowers in the garden

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
and give them to you.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
You won't die.

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
I didn't want to

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
change my mind

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,840
because of this.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,840
I know.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
The medicine is here.

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,000
Please dress me.

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,000
Xiaoqin.

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm here.

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,160
Do…

47
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,020
even...

48
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,320
Okay.

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
He's mastermindsidas?

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,320
You must know Thought Xu.

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,680
It is said that yelling is distrustful against it,

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,200
which is obviously...

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,320
oxygenated death.

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,880
Things that I 마지막ly avenged will all be forgotten.

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
It's raining.

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Let's go home.

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Come on.

58
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
You're so dead.

59
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
You can die in the hands of Miss An.

60
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
You're afraid of death.

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Let go.

62
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
You and Xiao brother should be together.

63
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
The past is still in the past.

64
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,280
What will happen here?

65
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
You can't get back together with this girl.

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
But I met a girl in the inn.

67
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
It's worth it.

68
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Do you still remember

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
you promised me a wish?

70
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
What do you want?

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I just want to be alone with you.

72
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
No matter what you choose to do,

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I'll help you.

74
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
That's it.

75
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I'll help you.

76
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
That's it.

77
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
If she's the same as me,

78
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
she'll be the same as me.

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Yue'er,

80
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
how are you doing with General Su?

81
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Your sister took the medicine you sent.

82
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
She's much better.

83
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Now I hope to be with you.

84
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
You've been a stubborn girl since you were a child.

85
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Don't let me down.

86
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
You're much better.

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
I didn't lie to you.

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
I know what I want.

89
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I don't know what I want.

90
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm getting older.

91
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm not in a hurry.

92
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll choose to do it.

93
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Are you okay?

94
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm fine.

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
You need to rest.

96
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
This way, you'll be better.

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Do you know what you like now?

98
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Here comes the Palace of Justice.

99
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,280
As for the Princess's incident yesterday,

100
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
you're all late.

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
I won't be chasing you.

102
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Now,

103
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
it's been half a month since the last time.

104
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Today,

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,280
a woman will be chosen to be the first one to be chosen.

106
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I...

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll choose...

108
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
General Su.

109
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
You're blind.

110
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I blocked you yesterday.

111
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Then,

112
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I'll...

113
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
I'll be the first one to be chosen.

114
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Miss An,

115
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
what about you?

116
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
I'll choose...

117
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
her.

118
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Okay.

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Jin Yi.

120
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Okay.

121
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll choose her.

122
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,280
I'll arrange it myself.

123
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Princess,

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
where are we going today?

125
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Princess.

126
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Princess.

127
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I asked you to block the knife yesterday.

128
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
You didn't leave her alone.

129
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
And you even have a knife with her.

130
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,280
It's her honor to be able to block the knife for you.

131
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
I'll explain it to her when Xuan Zhi comes back.

132
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I thought she only wrote the medicine.

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
You...

134
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Miss An, hurry up.

135
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Don't delay my treatment.

136
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Princess, please rest in peace.

137
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Don't be so cheap.

138
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
You've chosen me today.

139
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Of course, you'll listen to me.

140
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Princess,

141
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
can we go to the hunting today?

142
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
It's good that we can have a strong body.

143
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
General Su.

144
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
I can't go with you.

145
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Are you going to find Xiao Hu Chen?

146
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
No.

147
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I want to go home to see my father.

148
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I'll send you back to Prime Minister's Mansion.

149
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
No need.

150
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Take Xuan Zhi's words.

151
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Don't let him eat.

152
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Wait for me.

153
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Okay.

154
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Okay.

155
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Then,

156
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
please say hello to Prime Minister.

157
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Go back to Prime Minister's Mansion?

158
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Such a great blessing.

159
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Then, I'll send you and that old man to the hunting together.

160
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I...

161
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Let's go.

162
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Hurry up.

163
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
You've been acting for years.

164
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Why did you suddenly recover?

165
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Xiao Mo is acting for you.

166
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
He's just acting.

167
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
The court sent me here.

168
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
It's for the監管.

169
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Don't use your mind.

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I hope you can be a good man.

171
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Luckily, he's not alive for a few days.

172
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I'll help you.

173
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,280
They said you'd be back soon.

174
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
They said you're dead.

175
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I'll go back to Prime Minister's Mansion with you today.

176
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
I'll buy you some medicine.

177
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
What did you say?

178
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
I'll go back to the mansion.

179
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
I'll be back in a few days.

180
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I'll go back to the mansion.

181
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I'll buy you some medicine.

182
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I'll go back to the mansion.

183
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll buy you some medicine.

184
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll go back to the mansion.

185
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
I'll buy you some medicine.

186
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
I'll go back to the mansion.

187
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I'll buy you some medicine.

188
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
I'll go back to the mansion.

189
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I'll buy you some medicine.

190
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
