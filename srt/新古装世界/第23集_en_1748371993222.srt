I can't be with you.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
I can't.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,000
I know.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,400
Don't be sad.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,720
No, you don't know.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,240
You don't know.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,720
Did you remember something?

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,800
Cai Goong, you're in big trouble.

Maybe everyone is panicking.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,980
I feel bad that someone is going to be cut off.

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
The results are coming soon.

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,580
You all keep an eye on it.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,180
There can't be any mistakes.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,980
Okay.

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,580
Let's go back.

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,380
You...

40
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,380
How did you die?

41
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,980
Except for the car accident,

42
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,980
but fortunately,

43
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,980
death didn't let us leave.

The

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,580
Drink some tea.

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,380
It'll warm you up.

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,980
Ni'er, why aren't you drinking tea?

48
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,780
I only drink tea.

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,380
I don't like drinking tea.

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,580
An Ning, are you...

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,980
Jin Zhu, the night is not over yet.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,180
Take An Ning to the tent first.

53
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,980
An Ning, let's go in first.

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,180
Why do I feel that they are a bit strange?

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,980
President Zhao, we found the missing hunters.

56
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,780
They were tied up and knocked out.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,380
Xiao Hou Chen did it?

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
And Su Xun.

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,180
What?

60
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,180
Su Xun tied Xiao Hou Chen up?

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,780
Yes.

62
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,180
It's a bit interesting.

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,180
Do you remember everything?

64
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,380
Then...

65
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,180
They made up the memories of the past for us.

66
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,180
But our personality,

67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
our choices,

68
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,180
and even ourselves.

69
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,180
Just because love is real,

70
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm sad.

71
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,180
Why?

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm already married.

73
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,180
Then, do you want to go back to her?

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,780
I don't know.

75
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,780
Do you love your husband?

76
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,180
Then,

77
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,780
do you love the pig's dung?

78
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,780
It's hard to choose.

79
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
But,

80
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,780
I have to make sure that I'm alive before I make a choice.

81
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,780
Would you like to escape with us?

82
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:06,800
I was busy with the

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
past.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Now, I'm busy with life.

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I haven't seen the stars.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
In fact, the most beautiful scenery

87
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
only needs to be lifted.

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I missed too much in the past.

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Now, I can see the stars with you.

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
It's the life I want.

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
My moon

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
is right beside me.

93
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
This time,

94
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
we can't get up and leave.

95
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Brother Xiao,

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm sorry about what happened before.

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
It's not your fault.

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I didn't mean it here.

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Dad,

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
would you like to sing a song for us?

101
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Sure.

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Here?

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Fu Xi.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes.

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
How did Su Xun die?

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
What's going on?

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
There are only car accidents in the files.

108
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Who did it happen to?

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Mr. Zhao,

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I think you're worried about the price of the company's shares.

111
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
So you're here to help us.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm here to help you.

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm here to help you.

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I'm here to help you.

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
The company's shares are at a high price.

116
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
So I made an agreement with the other party.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I've blocked all the relevant information.

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Then tell me,

119
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
where is Su Xun's apology?

120
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
What else is there?

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
I think it's where they were camping.

122
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
We didn't get any pictures.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
It should be at that time,

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Su Xun did something to Xiao Hou Chen.

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
What?

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Another concert?

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
We have less than two days left.

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Promise him.

129
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Last time,

130
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
we had a big concert last week.

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Fine.

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
We don't have much time left.

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Go with them.

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Mr. Zhao,

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
thanks to you,

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm back in the host's business.

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Congratulations to the fourth place.

138
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Congratulations to the fourth place.

139
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Congratulations to the fourth place.

140
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Congratulations to the fourth place.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
To the fourth place,

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
we're back with two new members.

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Why did you make this show?

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
People of the family love real people.

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
We've always been very welcome.

146
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
As creators,

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
we always want to innovate.

148
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Right.

149
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
So we thought of traditional costumes,

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
love teams.

151
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Thanks to Fu Xi Technology

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
for providing us with the imitation technology.

153
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,800
The program has a high turnout.

154
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Of course,

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
some resistance sounds.

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,600
It obviously gave people a chance to come back to life,

157
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,120
but it also made people face death again.

158
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,360
So, how do you think about this?

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,920
You just said that

160
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,280
we brought hope to the dead.

161
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,360
Everything is beneficial and good.

162
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,640
Everyone should look at the positive side.

163
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,560
For example, this time,

164
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,440
at most four people can die.

165
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,440
It's like this cup of water.

166
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,080
Although I drank one sip,

167
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,520
there's still half left, right?

168
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,680
Yes.

169
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
There are two days left.

170
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,480
So, the relationship between the five of us

171
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,960
is very clear.

172
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
I don't know if the final result

173
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,200
will be an accident.

174
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,680
Until the last day,

175
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,840
we never know the final result.

176
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,080
This is the charm of our program.

177
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,880
I hope everyone continues to follow

178
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,080
the new drum decoration world.

179
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,720
Where do you want to take me before the accident?

180
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,000
I want to propose to you.

181
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,320
Don't you dislike me at that time?

182
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,280
I don't dislike you.

183
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,480
You'll look especially beautiful in wedding dress.

184
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,480
Bravo!

185
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,040
The bus is coming.

186
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,080
Can you really do it?

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Don't worry, Song Song.

188
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,080
I will definitely give my own life

189
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,480
a perfect ending.

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,480
Xiao Zhou.

191
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Xiao Zhou.

192
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,680
Xiao Zhou.

193
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Xiao Zhou.

194
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Xiao Zhou.

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Xiao Zhou, wake up.

196
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,280
Get the ambulance.

197
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
Hurry up.

198
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,680
I once owed everyone an apology.

199
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,280
This is the biggest regret

200
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I have ever had in my life.

201
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,880
Today, I want to use this stage

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,280
to show my gratitude

203
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,480
and support to you all.

204
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,480
I want to say thank you sincerely.

205
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,880
Thank you, everyone.

206
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,680
Bravo!

207
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,080
Song Song,

208
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
goodbye.

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,280
The night has come.

210
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,480
The courage to confess.

211
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,680
The peace of the dream.

212
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,880
Don't be afraid of the obstacles.

213
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Break through the tears.

214
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,080
The future is bright.

215
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Why?

216
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
If you want to leave,

217
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,880
why don't you come over to fight with me?

218
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,280
You are...

219
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,880
You can call me Zhou.

220
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
You can call me Fat.

221
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,080
Because

222
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,680
I gave you the life you wanted.

223
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
The world is like a windfall.

224
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,280
My heart is shaking.

225
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
A firm smile.

226
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,080
Victory is at my feet.

227
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,480
Hold on to the heart.

228
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,880
No matter how far it is.

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,280
The road ahead is unchanging.

230
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,080
Life is a journey.

231
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Let's breathe together.

232
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,480
The world is bright.

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,080
The dream is burning.

234
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,680
The world is bright.

235
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,080
The dream is burning.

236
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,680
The future is in my heart.

237
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,480
No matter how far it is.

238
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
The world is in my heart.

239
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
The world is bright.

240
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,080
The dream is burning.

241
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,480
The dream is burning.

242
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
Ugh.

243
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,520
Why?

244
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Fire!

245
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,280
Why?

246
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
The 살 frightened me.

247
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,080
I'm frightened now.

248
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,480
So I told you to go to theabs mileage.

249
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
They were right.

250
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,880
The face is all efter successfully.

251
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
Ti any 95 years ago,

252
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,480

I eat again,

254
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I have a doubt at height.

255
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
Don't be afraid of the seconds

256
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
The smile of heaven

257
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,480
The call of victory

258
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,880
Hold on to the heart

259
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,080
Don't be afraid of the distance

260
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,280
