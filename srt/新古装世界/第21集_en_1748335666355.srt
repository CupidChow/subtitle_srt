00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,360
You two, go back with me.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,520
Okay, we'll go back with you.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Xiao Hou Chen should be gone now.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll marry you in five days.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Brother Zhou, you should keep your word.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
After a while.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
After a while.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
After a while.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
After a while.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
After a while.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who are you?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
I'll save you.

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm going to do it.

15
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm going to do it.

16
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm going to see you.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,220
terrible

18
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,800
его

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,360
Get out of here!

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,720
Chicken master

21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,080
You�이

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,120
Find out if you want to kill me

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
Stop it!

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Xiao Hu Chen?

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,080
Eunuch Ding,

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,520
he is the son of the rebel Chen Gong.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
He killed the Prime Minister.

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,280
We all know that

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
he is special to His Majesty.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,520
Please don't pursue him anymore.

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,040
What?

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
His Majesty must be killed by the rebel.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
I'll kill him now.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
You can't change it!

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,760
General Su,

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
you are bold.

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
You are against the imperial decree.

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Do you want to kill me now?

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm protecting you.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,640
I don't need it.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
Don't make any more mistakes.

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,040
General,

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,600
I won't hurt you.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,400
Fine.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,440
Since you are a prince,

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
then I can only ça horse.

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Song Cheng, are you okay?

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh, no.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
Good girl.

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I will kill you!

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
Go away!

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,600
I know everything about today.

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
No one should mention it.

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,240
The one who defends the order,

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,040
kill him!

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,000
Go back to your room and rest.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
The rules will continue tomorrow.

58
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,880
Take a bath.

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Let's go.

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,400
Let's go.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Let's go.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,360
How could you kill him?

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
You're so afraid of him.

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,240
What kind of hero is he?

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,760
What do you want?

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,520
I...

67
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,040
I won't let you off.

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,720
I won't let you go off.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,820
I will kill him.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
Come here.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,320
Make something.

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,140
Well,

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,200
let's not make the deal.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No.

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,440
It is my ㅇ 잠깐만.

76
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,500
I must express it to my fans.

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,280
You are lacking strength now.

78
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,740
I have to be like my idols

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,560
to catch them to see the real me.

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
So they will remember me forever.

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
If I can't choose to stay,

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
I will leave on the stage with the most applause.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
I'll bring it to you.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Thank you for taking me out.

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I really like singing.

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
You are the most experienced artist I have ever met.

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
I also want to thank you.

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
If I can live again,

89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
I want to live a normal life.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Love,

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560

92
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
and love.

93
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Life.

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,560
I want to experience the precious things that I can't get out of this life.

95
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
You are awake.

96
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
You...

97
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Who are you?

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
I am An Ning.

99
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I will go to call my brother.

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Why am I in the new age?

101
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
I am a flower ghost.

102
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Why are you up?

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Brother Zhou,

104
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
do you still remember who I am?

105
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Maybe you don't know who I am.

106
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

107
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Maybe I know.

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Brother Zhou, Wudai.

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I will go back to the hospital.

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Have a good rest.

111
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Ning'er, take care of Brother Zhou.

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
I got it.

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
I am glad to meet you.

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Prime Minister has promised me.

115
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
I can't believe it.

116
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
General,

117
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
look at the situation now.

118
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
The princess is going to choose Xiao Wuchen.

119
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
You...

120
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
I won't let her go.

121
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
President Zhao, we met President Wei.

122
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Keep an eye on him.

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
It's only 24 hours a day.

124
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
He can't even look at me.

125
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Xiao Wuchen and Lin Cangyue

126
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
are in a relationship now.

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
How can they choose a husband and wife?

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
It's not bad.

129
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
The woman is supposed to be Wei.

130
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
But she is in trouble.

131
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
I heard that there is something about Su Xun.

132
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
They are really bad people.

133
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
They are really bad people.

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
They are really bad people.

135
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
How are you?

136
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Help!

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Help!

138
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Let her go.

139
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I will go with you.

140
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
You are really close to each other.

141
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
What are you doing?

142
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Xiao Wuchen.

143
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
I am a man.

144
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
I am a man.

145
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
I am a man.

146
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
I am a man.

147
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
I am a man.

148
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I am a man.

149
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
I am a man.

150
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
I am a man.

151
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
I am a man.

152
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
I am a man.

153
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I am a man.

154
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I am a man.

155
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
I am a man.

156
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
I am a man.

157
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
I am a man.

158
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
I am a man.

159
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I am a man.

160
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I am a man.

161
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
I am a man.

162
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
I am a man.

163
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
I am a man.

164
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
I am a man.

165
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I am a man.

166
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
I am a man.

167
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
I am a man.

168
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
I am a man.

169
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I am a man.

170
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
I am a man.

171
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
I am a man.

172
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm not afraid of you

173
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
