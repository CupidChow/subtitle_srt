1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,000
President Zhao, our repair has been reported.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The border police and the army

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,000
have formed a plan to re-establish the Xuan Zhi Hua.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Are you ready to re-establish the army?

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,600
I'll do as you say.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,600
No one can enter the city from now on.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,400
Let Mr. Ding re-establish the rules.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,600
President Zhao,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,600
what's the thing that the Qi Qi will open for Zhou Pipa?

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,200
What do you think, Mr. Zhou?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Zhou Pipa is a singer.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,200
He has a lot of fans.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,800
The comments just now

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
are all looking forward to seeing Zhou Pipa return to the stage.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
The server has started to say hello to the fans.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:16,600
The End

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,000
What's wrong, Princess?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Who am I?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Princess, you're so bold.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
How dare you go back to the city?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You just said you'd come back in time.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,400
I've never said I can't go there.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,000
You...

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
Mr. Ding,

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
you're so responsible for the princess.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm afraid you're a bit unscrupulous.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,400
The emperor is punished by the people.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
In this Wudang Inn,

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
no one can say anything.

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Today,

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
the princess should be with General Su.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Why did she come out alone?

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
It's the princess who broke the rules first.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Tomorrow,

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
everyone

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
must choose the right time.

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Yes.

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,200
You all remember me.

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,600
Before you leave Wudang Inn,

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
no one can come near you.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
You're under arrest.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Stop!

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Mr. Ding.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
What's wrong?

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You were a bit harsh to the princess just now.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After all, the princess is the daughter of Prime Minister.

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
By then...

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
What do you know?

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
If I don't say so,

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
can I protect them?

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Learn from it.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Run!

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Where did you go?

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
I went to the chief's house.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
Why did you save the princess today?

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
I was fooled.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
If you were fooled,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,200
wouldn't you even die?

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
I think you like her.

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Don't forget that

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
she's your daughter who killed the enemy.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
I didn't forget.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
I'll definitely marry the princess

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
and stay in Prime Minister's house.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
Don't act rashly in the future.

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Got it?

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't think I can't see it.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You fought for her.

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
You saved her in Prime Minister's house.

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
You clearly like her.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
You like Chu Pipa?

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Who likes her?

74
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
She's so kind.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Ning'er, we must live.

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

77
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
We won't leave for a while.

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Have a good rest.

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Then...

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Do you like her?

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I like her.

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I like her.

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I like her.

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
I like her.

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I like her.

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Will she really like you?

87
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
General Su, look for me.

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Xiao Xiu, you're so quick to recover.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
If you need anything,

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll do it for you.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I think you can get a reward.

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,800
I suggest you stay away from the princess.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The Wu Dan Khezhang

94
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
is not a 369-level

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
and a shield.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
It's to see who

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
can be the princess's heart.

98
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,200
You know what?

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Do you like her?

100
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Do you like her?

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Do you like the princess?

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Will you marry Ning?

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
If Zhou Xing wants to live,

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
she can help me and the princess.

105
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
The princess is a friend of the PPA.

106
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,800
If the princess doesn't like you,

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
I won't make a mistake.

108
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,200
Moreover,

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
the princess is well-off.

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
General Su is a good boy.

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
You and Ning

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
have a brother and sister relationship.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,800
Forget it.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I should be the one to take the lead.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But if you really have a brother and sister,

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I won't let you take the lead.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why did the princess choose General Su today?

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
She broke the rules.

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
I just want to go home.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to go back to see her.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
But you're really a good boy.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you have any feelings for each other?

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
You're so wise.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,000
We came to this inn just to get married.

125
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
How can we get married?

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
You're so talented.

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Who do you choose,

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Xiao Houchen and General Su?

129
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
The princess said

130
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
she would marry General Su.

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
What are you waiting for?

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
You'll know in the end.

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
But there's a chance

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
that you can leave the inn.

135
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
After tomorrow's end,

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll answer you.

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,400
General.

138
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Zhang Fujing.

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
General.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
The enemy has been not in the city.

141
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
They're waiting for the princess's army.

142
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
Now they're fighting for our country.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
We're waiting for your return.

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll take care of them.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll take care of them.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,200
We're waiting for your return.

147
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
What?

148
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,400
I'll take care of them.

149
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I must protect them.

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,400
General.

151
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,000
General.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
You must get married.

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Leave the inn.

154
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Wait.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,600
Wait.

156
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Help me find someone.

157
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Between General Su and Brother Xiao,

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
the princess can choose someone she likes.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Xiao Fei.

160
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,400
I was going to ask you to hide in the scenery.

161
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
Why do you even want to test me?

162
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,800
Okay.

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,600
I won't.

164
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
Then my concert next night

165
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,200
will you come?

166
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,400
What concert?

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
It's the biggest stage

168
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
I've ever seen in the capital.

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Only my music.

170
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'll sing it.

171
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
What do you and An Ning want to be?

172
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
I've never seen a girl like her.

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I don't care about my birth and life.

174
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,600
If she has someone in her heart,

175
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
she'll stick to it.

176
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
This person is Brother Xiao.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,600
What?

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
You're jealous?

179
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't fight me.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't fight me.

181
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
I know the princess said it for her.

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
She wants us to live a better life.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Why do you want to see her?

184
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
I really want to see her.

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
I want to see her.

186
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,400
Princess.

187
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
General Su.

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Why do you want to see her?

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
In the inn,

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
everyone has a chance.

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,400
It's late.

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Please go back to rest.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
General Su is the emperor?

194
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Why do you even have to

195
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,600
stay up all the time?

196
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,800
It's okay.

197
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm going back.

198
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Please.

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why are you laughing?

200
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Stay away from the princess.

201
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Do you hear me?

202
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'll stay away from you.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
Stay away from me too.

204
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
General, go back to rest.

205
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,800
It's okay.

206
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
I found out that the inn has moved today.

207
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I'll stay here tonight

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
for the princess's safety.

209
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,200
How can you trouble me?

210
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Okay.

211
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
The princess is also in a bad mood today.

212
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm here.

213
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Have some water.

214
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
Who dares to come near you?

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,240
This place

216
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
costs three percent of my total.

217
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,360
I pay five per cent to försöfuse구� нек Евan to detect evil ideas with you ,

I'll force you to go to the Gensokyo .

Take a group.

224

Normandovalo

225
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,160
The girl who killed him

226
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,600
Such a start would be like TV juliation

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Like in the heart

Don't move your body and mind

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Don't change your mind
