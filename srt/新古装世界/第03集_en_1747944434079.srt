1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Into the next century

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,200
As for the future一个的时刻

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,200
The head of the imperial court specially brought a master yard

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,380
The epidemic seriously killed people

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,980
to break into the capital

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,800
The treasure

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,640
will be planted in the house

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,960
Please listen to me

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,520
I dare not

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,200
bemerce Public

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,060
Twenty thousand

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,060
It's really important to open it in the future.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,060
Next one.

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,060
Next one.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060
I didn't eat the roast chicken last night.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,060
I'll have to think about it again when they go out.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,060
General Du.

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,060
General Du.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,060
Today, I'll make a new spice.

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,060
It's more delicious.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,060
Next one.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,060
I don't dare to kiss the face.

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,060
I'll protect you.

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
Alright.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,060
Since you've done it, open it.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,060
I'll protect you.

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,060
Next one.

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Chicken.

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
What's that?

30
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Why is it a roast chicken?

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
Why is it a roast chicken?

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,060
It's not a medicine.

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,060
To save the seeds from my reflections,

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,060
I've charred them with a roast chicken,

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,060
Community Tra Dynamics Team Rel解 waxades vs. players,

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,060
Qing Switch Team Relic Team Rebolts Team involved and teams didn't solar过年约,

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,980
which means that all our chairs are어서视子的秒日

38
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,060
So Xi and General Su are the winners.

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,540
Are you two going to compete again?

40
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,100
No need.

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,540
If the answer is correct,

42
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,380
Xiao Xiong is the best.

43
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,060
I'm willing to compete.

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,180
Then the princess and Mr. Xiao will be together.

45
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,820
What?

46
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,940
Eunuch Ding,

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,300
according to the rule of the Wudang Inn,

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
if you are a woman,

49
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,940
you can choose a man to go out.

50
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,980
That's right.

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,980
I'm Xiao An Ning.

52
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,340
As a woman,

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm willing to be a man.

54
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,780
You are a man,

55
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,260
and you are a woman now.

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,500
You are a criminal.

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,620
Come on.

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,740
Excuse me.

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,140
An Ning.

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,900
You are playing with me.

61
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
Unfortunately, I don't like you.

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,260
But the two women are men.

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,620
It looks more interesting.

64
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,660
Eunuch Ding, what do you think?

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,100
An Ning.

66
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,820
Since the princess has been sent out,

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,380
An Ning, you can stay.

68
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,180
There are two winners.

69
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,660
I'm willing to compete with Mr. Xiao.

70
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,860
You have to know the rules first.

71
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,020
Princess, you choose first.

72
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
If you don't want to know,

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,500
come to the clinic.

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,300
I choose him.

75
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,940
No.

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,380
That's it.

77
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,260
Princess, you and Mr. Xiao

78
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,100
An Ning,

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
you and General Su.

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,420
Me?

81
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,980
How is it, Princess?

82
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,580
Is my clinic big enough?

83
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,980
Is it possible that

84
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
you are also married?

85
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,860
Xiao Mo is treated by Miss.

86
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,020
It's okay.

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,780
Tell me.

88
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,100
What is my sister missing?

89
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,380
General Su.

90
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,700
An Gu.

91
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
Miss.

92
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,140
General Su, why do you choose this place today?

93
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,740
It's fair to me.

94
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,940
I want to compete with An Gu.

95
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,740
Miss, you can compete.

96
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,140
I can compete.

97
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,340
But General Su,

98
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,940
can you go with me to a place?

99
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
Where do you want to go?

100
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,540
You want to kill my sister?

101
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
I knew it.

102
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,940
I shouldn't believe you.

103
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,140
Miss Mo, the princess's play is a disease.

104
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,340
As long as the plant is in control of the energy,

105
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,940
you can cure the princess.

106
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,140
How should I believe you?

107
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,140
Xiao Mo came to the inn to marry you.

108
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,340
If I hurt the princess,

109
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,740
I can't help you

110
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,140
if I have any benefits.

111
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,140
So,

112
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,140
you saved me last night.

113
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,740
Why did you save me last night?

114
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,140
You killed me.

115
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
No one knows your identity.

116
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Liang Ning doesn't dare to offend my father.

117
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
What if I dare?

118
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,140
I hate you forever.

119
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Okay.

120
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,340
So, Xiao Mo is the one who hurt my sister?

121
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Don't talk nonsense.

122
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,340
You have the power to do it.

123
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
You have to help me today.

124
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,940
No.

125
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,740
That's the place where the princess and Xiao Xun live.

126
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,340
We can't disturb them.

127
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,940
Why do you want to help them?

128
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,540
This is the rule of the Wu Dan Inn.

129
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
We need to be careful.

130
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,340
Then General Su, you can leave it here.

131
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,140
Goodbye.

132
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,340
Miss An,

133
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,140
you can't break the rules.

134
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
Otherwise, you will be disqualified.

135
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Hurry up.

136
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
You are not the one who is going to be the master of the Wu Dan Inn.

137
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,140
Miss An,

138
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,140
you look better in the dress.

139
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,140
But you look worse in this dress.

140
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Where are you looking at?

141
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,140
Miss An, you can't disobey the rules.

142
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,140
There is a general Su like this.

143
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
He doesn't need a master of the Wu Dan Inn.

144
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,140
He is the judge of the inn.

145
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,740
Then Duan Chang Cao will be the head of the Wu Dan Inn.

146
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,540
I will go to the inn to help the princess.

147
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,740
You are so dangerous.

148
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,140
Xiao Mo, you are so ridiculous.

149
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,940
But this inn

150
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,140
is so dangerous that you have to sign it every day.

151
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,340
It's too late.

152
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,740
I will go there myself.

153
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,140
You just need to be in charge of it.

154
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,940
I think the princess' house is about the same.

155
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,140
Take this and give it to the princess.

156
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
I hate people who lie to me the most.

157
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,740
If you can't cure my sister,

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,140
I will not be able to forgive you.

159
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,740
Now, Miss An,

160
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,340
you need to think about the future

161
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,740
for the princess' inn.

162
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,340
Xuan Yi is really a new person.

163
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,540
He is married.

164
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,340
Marry? No need to write.

165
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,740
You are too greedy.

166
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,340
Do you know what you like?

167
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,940
How dare you?

168
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,340
An Ning is now a daughter of a rich man.

169
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,740
If you want to save your life, you can go to her.

170
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,740
But I will choose you.

171
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,540
Sister.

172
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,140
Yue'er, this is too much for the princess.

173
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,140
I let you break into such a big house.

174
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,140
Sister.

175
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,540
Wait a minute.

176
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,940
I will find a way to save you.

177
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,740
I am a person who will die.

178
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,140
You are so good.

179
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,940
How could I find a new person to help me?

180
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,740
You are so disobedient.

181
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,340
You are not coming back.

182
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,740
I am watching you.

183
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,340
Why are you kneeling?

184
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,740
Sister, you can't risk your life for me.

185
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I will go and ask the princess yourself.

186
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,140
I will call you back.

187
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
No, sister.

188
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,740
Father has agreed.

189
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,940
He must leave the Wudang Inn today.

190
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,740
No.

191
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,140
Sister.

192
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,340
They are going to run away.

193
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,140
Listen to me.

194
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Sister.

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,740
If I say that I like Su Qu,

196
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,540
can you help me?

197
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,940
Yue'er, when did you meet him?

198
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,940
I...

199
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,940
General Su, I know that you are a good person.

200
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,140
I often listen to his stories in the tea house.

201
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
When I see him,

202
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,740
he is indeed a good person.

203
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,140
I fell in love with him.

204
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,940
This is not a lie.

205
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,140
I have known you for a long time.

206
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,540
That's why I came to the inn.

207
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,140
If I leave today,

208
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,540
I will have no chance.

209
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,940
It's a lie to come to the inn.

210
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,140
No one can escape from the Wudang Inn.

211
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
Brother.

212
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,940
I like the new speed of the close-up.

213
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,740
I don't care about the thought of thinking.

214
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
I want to be with him.

215
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,340
So, Miss,

216
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,540
I really want to be with General Su.

217
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,740
An Ning.

218
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,140
I don't want to go.

219
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,940
I don't want to go.

220
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Why do you always have a problem?

221
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,940
