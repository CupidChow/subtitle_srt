00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Story of Ling Tangyue

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I am Ling Tangyue, the daughter of Jincheng Prime Minister.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am here to propose a marriage for you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The story will be told from the beginning of the night.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The law of the country of Fengling, 21 years old,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is a free and compatible man in the Wudang Inn.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
After 21 days, the land is split in half.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When my sister passed away,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
my father was in the Lianyin General's Mansion.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My sister was seriously ill.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
She was bedridden for many years.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She was in no condition to take her clothes off.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The path of Lianyin is difficult to follow.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My lady.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sister, you can't go to the Wudang Inn.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who are you going to fight with?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A Ying.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sister, I have packed your bags.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can leave tonight.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I will go to the Wudang Inn.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The boss told me to go there.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will go to the General's Mansion.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will go to the Wudang Inn for my sister.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Nonsense.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go to change your clothes.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let my father see it.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He should punish you.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sir,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
would you like to take a good look at my sister?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This pulse is the old woman of Lianyin.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will open a new house.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can change it if you don't want to.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sir, you are so mysterious.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
My lady, you are overestimated.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yue'er.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My father sent me a message tomorrow.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will wear the right clothes.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Put it on.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sir,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I am not good at hunting today.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please give me a house that can sleep at night.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sister Weiqu is in this house.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I will definitely help you to get married to General Su.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ready, go.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am worried.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please give me a house.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why is she here?

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She is still busy.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She should not have found my sister.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She should be the general.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I guarantee that she will be happy.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's talk about it later.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
General Su.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will die if I want to.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will not die if I don't.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Miss Ruan is smiling.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Little girl, Lin Cangyun.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Greetings, General Su.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's the princess.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Excuse me.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
General, why are you so rude?

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can't talk.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You come.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She can't see me.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let me do it.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No need.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have seen the princess and General Su.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
hma

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
He will get ochre in enmity.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The most commonitary ends will die.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is he?

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes, he is the Consort.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Скرัญеハ่ ؟

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
I have two questions for you.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,400
What a joke.

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760
Hurry up and give me a hand.

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,120
General Su,

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
give me another hand.

81
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,800
The light is coming.

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,160
Welcome everyone to the Wudang Inn.

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
We are Ding.

84
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
Since we are here,

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,360
we must follow the rules of the inn.

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:17,320
dle

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
только

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
I don't think so.

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,960
Don't read entstera,

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm Xiao An Ning, 21 years old. I'm willing to join the course.

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,960
He Gui, please sign here. We need to remind you one thing.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,960
There's no one to sign in the course.

93
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Every night, you must sign here.

94
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,960
If you have a middle school student,

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
you can sign here.

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,960
If you have a middle school student, you can sign here.

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Father didn't do anything wrong, right?

98
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Your Highness, it's okay.

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Lord Cheng San asked me to tell you.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
This is the first time.

101
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
You must take the lead.

102
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Take General Su down.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Who?

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
It's me, Your Highness.

105
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Young Master Xiao, what's the matter?

106
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Your Highness, there's no medicine for the wound.

107
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
I have a new medicine.

108
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
It's good for your health.

109
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I took the medicine last night.

110
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
How do you think I look today?

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
You look...

112
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
How dare you!

113
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Your Highness, please forgive me.

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm a busy person. I can't see you.

115
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I can only rely on...

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Mo...

117
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
It seems that you are very efficient.

118
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Your Highness, you are very good at this.

119
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
You are not bad.

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
The patient is from the entrance and exit.

121
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
You should know what I'm talking about.

122
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Lord Cheng San doesn't want anyone to know that I'm a busy person.

123
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Of course, I'm here.

124
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Your Highness, you will be fine.

125
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
But I'm afraid that you won't believe me.

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
You were hot just now.

127
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
I think you have a red face.

128
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
You look good.

129
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I will drink it.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Please go back.

131
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Tofu.

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Have you played with it?

133
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Everyone, you can form a team.

134
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
The winner of the final is

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,960
the one who can arrange the team to go out tomorrow.

136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
You win.

137
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
You can choose Su Xun.

138
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Please.

139
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
You are not a little monkey.

140
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Give me the book.

141
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Otherwise...

142
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
I will be a little monkey.

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I heard that General Su has a spirit in the battlefield.

144
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
But I know that he is a little monkey.

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
I am a weak woman.

146
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I will never lose.

147
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Again.

148
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Again.

149
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
General Su wins.

150
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Please arrange the team to go out tomorrow.

151
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You and you.

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
What are you talking about?

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
You and you.

154
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Good. Good.

155
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I don't agree.

156
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
By the way, a man and a woman are first.

157
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Then you can't be in the team.

158
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Then you can choose the princess and the skin.

159
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
No.

160
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Then you can choose the brother.

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
No.

162
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Then who else?

163
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
General, don't forget yourself.

164
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Me?

165
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
No.

166
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Then I don't have to win.

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
They three choose one, right?

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
I don't want to choose anyone.

169
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Princess.

170
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Don't forget the rules of the Wudang Battle.

171
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Then you go to my father.

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I will not choose.

173
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Can you take me?

174
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
The next day

175
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,960
So, there are only three men in the Wudang Battle tomorrow.

176
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Then I can only choose Yun'er.

177
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
General.

178
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
But the man killed like this.

179
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
What about the minister of the Ministry of Revenue?

180
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Don't understand.

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Take care of the body.

182
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Yes.

183
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
My lord.

184
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
This is the doctor who the lady invited to the princess.

185
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
He is a blind man.

186
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I, Xiao Houchen, have seen the minister of the ministry of revenue.

187
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Doctor, this way please.

188
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
No.

189
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I can't be tired tonight.

190
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Yun'er, you give me a house that can sleep at night.

191
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Okay.

192
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Go.

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
You see this?

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I will go to the general's house to sleep here.

195
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I will definitely listen to you.

196
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Then I will go to the general's house to sleep here.

197
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
I will go to the general's house to sleep here.

198
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I have been to the general's house recently.

199
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
But I still can't find the future.

200
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I can find the future.

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960
The old thief in the city has been holding the princess for a long time.

202
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I can only enter the Wudang Inn and the Su family to solve the problem.

203
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
You must enter the inn.

204
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,960
I will help you to stop two families from getting married.

205
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,960
But why can't I kill the old thief?

206
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
It's a waste of time.

207
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Family feud and family repression are both important.

208
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
My lord.

209
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,960
You want me and the princess to get married.

210
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
If you can fight with her and get married,

211
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
you can enter the Prime Minister's house and find the Hua Mingchun.

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,960
You must not use the opportunity to use the opportunity.

213
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Remember.

214
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Princess.

215
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Don't forget the rules of the Wudang Inn.

216
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Then you go to my father.

217
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
I will not choose.

218
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Can you marry me?

219
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Princess, I won.

220
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Have they cleared all the five living conditions?

221
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Have they cleared all the five living conditions?

222
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Wu Xi.

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I hope the Kofo people can come to the Shifu Palace to fight with me.

224
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,960
If you want to live, you must be the best man to restore your son.

225
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I am willing to marry General.

226
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
But here I am afraid.

227
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Poison is in Sh sigma.

228
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Hate in the gun.

229
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I don't want to hold back.

230
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
She will be unmoven after the war.

231
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I pity her.

232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
The unsolved heiress.

233
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Will head against the enemy.

234
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
It's just a baby.

235
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Done.

236
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
No need to worry.

237
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
心 is like death a歡迎 bowl.

238
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Let me like you.

239
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm afraid of being late

240
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm afraid of being late

241
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm afraid of being late

242
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm afraid of being late

243
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm afraid of being late

244
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I'm afraid of being late

245
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm afraid of being late

246
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm afraid of being late

247
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm afraid of being late

248
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm afraid of being late

249
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm afraid of being late

250
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm afraid of being late

251
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
I'm afraid of being late

252
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm afraid of being late

253
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm afraid of being late

254
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm afraid of being late

255
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
I'm afraid of being late

256
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm afraid of being late

257
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm afraid of being late

258
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
I'm afraid of being late

259
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I'm afraid of not being late

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm afraid of not changing

261
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,700
Don't change

262
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
I don't want to create any trouble
