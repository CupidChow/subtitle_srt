1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
When I smoke, I will be able to recover.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,020
How do you want me?

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,260
I promise to sign off the payment.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,800
Let the beautiful people profit by half the cash.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,900
Let each other buy a living because of money.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,380
Puppy's wish

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,240
He Ben sends to the famous urging shop of the successful 무 لاnhino.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm not a bad person.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm not a bad person.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm not a bad person.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm not a bad person.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm not a bad person.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm not a bad person.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
I'm not a bad person.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,240
I'm not a bad person.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
I'm not a bad person.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm not a bad person.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
I'm not a bad person.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm not a bad person.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm not a bad person.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm not a bad person.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm not a bad person.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm not a bad person.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm not a bad person.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Miss An, do you like to eat roses?

26
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
I'll make you a rose every day.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I love to eat roses.

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
I love to eat roses.

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Zhou Huakui, you're not here.

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
You can't even go to the red building.

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
That's right, Pipa.

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Why are you in the Wu Dan Inn?

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
It's not good.

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
But you will be killed.

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Who told you that you're not willing to marry me?

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Is there a reason to marry me?

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
If you still want to listen to Pipa sing,

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
can you help me?

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Miss, don't go.

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Sister, listen to me.

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
The song that Pipa sang is very good.

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
You will definitely like it.

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Who will like it?

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
I will not only sing,

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
I will also change the song.

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
It's ridiculous.

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Is it that day that I was in the hands of the teacher?

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Is it Huakui?

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
If you do it again, I'll draw you.

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
The girl hasn't chosen a gift for me yet.

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Pipa, we're leaving now.

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Here, Miss An.

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
You must come back alive.

54
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
I'll send you. Take it.

55
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
What's wrong?

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
What's wrong?

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Try it.

58
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
What's wrong?

59
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
It's too weak.

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
It's not her.

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Don't eat it.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm so rich.

63
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Thank you for everything.

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I will return it to you.

65
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
How?

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
With me?

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Of course not.

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
I can't choose you because you saved me.

69
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
You have to choose me.

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
I hope you like me more.

71
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Besides, I'm not saving you because of this.

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Then let's make it clear.

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
If you still don't go to Taohao Anning,

74
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
you'll lose your last hope.

75
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Miss, you asked me

76
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
why I'm so busy.

77
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Actually, my father is a blind man.

78
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
I didn't know he died.

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
But in his heart,

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm still the greatest secret.

81
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
That's why I reminded myself.

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
When I was born,

83
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Miss, you're a good girl

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
for the family.

85
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
In my heart,

86
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
you're the best woman in the world.

87
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll give you my best.

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll give you my best.

89
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
You're just doing it for your life.

90
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
You don't like me.

91
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Miss,

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm a newbie.

93
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Miss,

94
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm a newbie.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm a newbie.

96
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm a newbie.

97
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
I'm a newbie.

98
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Miss, come and have a look.

99
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
I'll buy you a newbie.

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
What's this?

101
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
It's fine if there's a fish king in the cave.

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
There's a problem with a newbie.

103
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
The netizens found that the present item

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
might be replaced with the present memory.

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
How did the props find it?

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Hurry up and say it.

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm sorry, sir.

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
There's a patrol today.

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Give it to me.

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I want this.

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Okay.

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll fail.

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
You're not allowed to move.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
You're not allowed to buy the present.

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
This present item is different from the other.

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Just like you,

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
you really are a general.

118
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
You're being taken away from me.

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm not.

120
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
As a woman,

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm too independent.

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
It's not a good thing.

123
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Take the crisis out.

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Yes, sir.

125
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Let's go.

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Move away.

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
He saw it.

128
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
It's okay.

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Let's go back.

130
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Miss, you're

131
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
still thinking about me.

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm grateful for

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
your kindness.

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm willing to pay back the money.

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I hope you'll die.

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
No need.

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
You saved me last night.

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
So soon,

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I feel guilty from this dirtiness.

140
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Let me go.

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
And please.

142
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
I don't want you to do cocaine anymore.

143
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I'll think of something else.

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
It's decent.

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
See you.

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes.

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,960
General.

148
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
General Su.

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,920
Why did you bring me here?

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,720
Xiao Ou Chen is not in hiding.

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
I'm afraid she's against you.

152
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,320
I'll leave her alone.

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,520
General Su.

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,360
Why did you say that?

155
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,080
She seems to be weak now,

156
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
but she's not annoying.

157
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
If you don't believe me,

158
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
I can try it next time.

159
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,280
General Su.

160
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
You're protecting me.

161
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,520
You're the daughter of Prime Minister.

162
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
This is my order.

163
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
May I ask why you're not married yet?

164
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
In order to...

165
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
General Su.

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,920
She always loves me.

167
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,820
That's why you said you'd marry me that day.

168
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,100
General Su

169
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,860
defected from your marriage

170
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,000
to protect homeland.

171
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,960
Now,

172
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,760
I셨 that you will marry me.

173
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,380
What were you talking about?

174
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,980
You help the country to settle down,

175
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,460
and the people to live a peaceful life.

176
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
It's all because of you.

177
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
You need to be far away.

178
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,100
Princess, you're really different from the Noble Lady.

179
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,300
Come and get some fish.

180
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,260
Add some flavoring to the vinegar.

181
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,660
Flavoring?

182
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
It's snow?

183
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,060
It's still June.

184
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,580
What's going on?

185
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,860
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,060
I'll change it to rain.

187
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,020
Wait.

188
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,700
Is it possible that it's June?

189
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,580
Maybe

How can General Su be so cold-hearted?

192
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,660
Don't you want to go back to the battlefield?

193
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,980
That's reasonable.

194
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,060
Since the God has already said it,

195
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,140
I'll have to kill someone.

196
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,900

Don't be too hard on me.

I've always been a good girl.

203
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,900
As long as I promise to marry you,

204
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,420
I'll make you my wife.

205
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,540
I'll be with you.

206
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,060
We can be together.

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,700
But why must he still be upset?

211
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,220
