we just sang on Spring Day is

782
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,440
a song that we and ARMY like very much now, but

783
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,980
above all, it feels

784
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,600
more precious because we can sing it together at the concert hall

785
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,199
like

786
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:07,880


787
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:11,480

When I listen to the songs you sing, I feel

790
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,739
that my stamina, which I had lost slightly during the performance, is

791
01:43:22,739 --> 01:43:25,400


792

01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,139
recharging again.  I hope that the memories

798
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:44,900
we sang together today

801
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:55,139
from the songs we met again after a long time

802
01:43:55,139 --> 01:43:57,119
to the stages that many people loved. I

803

solo first, and

these hearts, who I missed so much, keep moving and

876
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,639
cry again and

877
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:35,960
while preparing for something,

883
01:47:46,739 --> 01:47:47,520
.

01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:48,600


885
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,639


886
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:53,060
I started watching bts' performances. It's really

887
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:56,940
something like this.

889
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,060
The second thing I want to say after having a performance at this place

890
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:04,320
is a little

891
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,600


892
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,540
bit refreshing.

893
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:12,900


894
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,159


895
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,500


896
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:21,060
Try preparing the choreography of Run BTS and

897
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:24,199
doing what you do, and put on autotune on your voice,

898
01:48:24,199 --> 01:48:28,679
oh well

899
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:30,900
,

900
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,480
I feel very relieved because it is a performance that I prepared a lot in various ways to make it even a little bit more fun for all of you who are watching.

901
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,520


902
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,719


903
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:42,440
As much as

904
01:48:42,679 --> 01:48:46,080
I did, I have to say many things on this stage, so I

905
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,000


906
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,840
feel relieved.

907
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:54,440
Yes, and the

908
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,540
third thing I want to say is, I

909
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:03,920
want to talk about the future. No, I

910
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,179


911
01:49:06,179 --> 01:49:07,560
'm not going to say anything out loud.

912
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,800


913
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:15,420


914
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:17,040
I think it's time for the

915
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,900


916
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,820
BTS members

917
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:21,980

01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:25,760
and our

919
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:29,100
ARMYs, and I think it's time to draw a picture of the future with our faith as one with

920
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:32,420
you all

921
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,640

922
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,239

Busan concert  [Applause] I want to say thank

925
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,659
you so much for coming to all the fans and the public,

926
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,040


927
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,960


928
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,320


929
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:54,590


930
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,580
and I want to say that I

931
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:01,619


932
01:50:01,619 --> 01:50:03,920
love you. Thank you so much, love you.

933
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,560
It's been too long It's been a long breath

934
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,920
I'm sorry I

935
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:18,420
believe

936
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:20,270
we need trust

937
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:27,460
[Applause]

938
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:30,850
[Music]

01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:36,300
[Applause]

940
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,280
Because I think it's over, it's not a little,

941
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,739
it's a little bit sad Oh, but our

942
01:50:40,739 --> 01:50:43,560
performance

943
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,020
isn't the only one today and we

944
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:48,080
're going to continue it, everyone

945
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,639


946
01:50:49,639 --> 01:50:52,920


947
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,960
I’m sorry, but don’t be too sad. Oh, and as I said before,

948
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,880
thank you for the happy birthday. I was happy to be

949
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,940


950
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:03,360
born, so ah well,

951
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,719
everyone, I’ve turned one year old,

952
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:09,560
but I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately. I

953
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:14,159
don’t want to get old.

954
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,320


955
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:19,280


956
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,840


957
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,580
I want to perform for a long time.

958
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:25,199
So, ah, I thought a lot about why I was getting old,

959
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:28,080
but

960
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,659
these days I have more time to talk with you guys, and

961
01:51:30,659 --> 01:51:32,760


962
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,800
I just started doing this. What I feel more today is that I do

963
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,619


964
01:51:36,619 --> 01:51:38,840
n't want to get older.

965
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,000
I didn't

966
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,580
wonder at all and didn't think much about it, but

967
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,139
I'm really curious. I think it makes me think a lot about what we will be like in the next

968
01:51:46,139 --> 01:51:48,020
10 years.

969
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:50,340


970
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,760


971
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,739


972
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:59,639


973
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:01,440
Wouldn't it be better if

974
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,020


975
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,600
we could make more with you guys

976
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,260
? Isn't it just a taste of what we've come this far?

977
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,910


978
01:52:12,910 --> 01:52:20,420
[Applause]

979
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:24,300
I'm confident that

980
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,440
74

981
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,020
BTS

982
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,380


983
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:36,719
is an embarrassing age.

984
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,020


985
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,119
I think it’s the same and it’s the most meaningful. I was so

986
01:52:42,119 --> 01:52:43,440
happy and

987
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:46,380
I hope to see you again soon.

988
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,050
Thank you for coming

989
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:54,420
[Applause]

990
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:57,080
Hi,

991
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:02,940
I’m not the teacher at the

992
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:05,159
end of the day. Today I don’t want to do it at the end

993
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:07,560
.

994
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,320


995
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:13,560
I wanted to do this kind of natural surgery, so I did it now.

996
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:15,960
First of all, it's been a while since I've

997
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,219
seen you. I just wanted to look good, so

998
01:53:17,219 --> 01:53:18,119
I just

999
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:20,659
shaved my head.

1000
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,639
We're not that old

1001
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:28,199
yet.  Nidai friends can make a comeback as soon as they shave the back of their head at the

1002
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:30,239
age of 23. But

1003
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:33,119
how old

1004
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,920


1005
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,100


1006
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,880
do you look? My hyung is 25. Anyway,

1007
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,739
I am a person who always talks a lot

1008
01:53:43,739 --> 01:53:47,659
, but today

1009
01:53:47,659 --> 01:53:50,340
I came up without thinking about anything.

1010
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,840


1011
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,820
I came up with no thought of what to say at the end, and I just came up

1012
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,440
today with a happy heart

1013
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,780
to protect you with today's memories

1014
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,540


1015
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:02,420
So, in fact, we've been

1016
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,040


1017
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,080
doing this for the last time in 2019, and it's been almost 3 years since we did this.

1018
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,780


1019
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:12,179
I haven't had a proper concert in a while now, but I'm

1020
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:13,980
so thankful for waiting for 3 years. Also,

1021
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:16,380
because it's our first standing performance today, there

1022
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:18,659
are some things that are a little lacking.

1023
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:19,920


1024
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,480


1025
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,520


1026
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,860
But for

1027
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,600
safety reasons, I can't do

1028
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,699
it, and I apologize again.

1029
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:30,960


1030
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,619
Anyway

1031
01:54:33,619 --> 01:54:37,100


1032
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,560


1033
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,340
, I think

1034
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,210


1035
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:50,159


1036
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:52,580
you'll know even if

1037
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:55,739
I don't say much

1038
01:54:55,739 --> 01:54:58,440
.  The hearts of the 7 BTS members have

1039
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,239
gone and if you

1040
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,520
believe in us, we will overcome national relations no matter what happens to me in the future, and we will

1041
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,960


1042
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,500


1043
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,480
happily perform and

1044
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,760
make music with you,

1045
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,860
so please have faith as Hoseok said

1046
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:17,360
.  I hope

1047
01:55:17,699 --> 01:55:20,820
so, I hope you die today with today's memories

1048
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,480


1049
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,699
happily. Thank you

1050
01:55:23,699 --> 01:55:25,560
so much for waiting and doing this for 3 years

1051
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,360


1052
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,280


1053
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:30,300

1056
01:55:34,290 --> 01:55:44,040
.  Applause]

Namjoon hyung

1059
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:50,179
said he just came up today without thinking, but

1060
01:55:50,179 --> 01:55:54,139
I usually don't have any thoughts

1061
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,639
I'm sorry

1062
01:55:55,639 --> 01:55:58,460
I know I know

1063
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:01,920
Oh, we've been together for

1064
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,440
9 or

1065
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:07,260
10 years. It's been almost 10 years.

1066
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,020


1067
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:12,000


1068
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,400
I was thoughtless.

1069
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,400


1070
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,699
What did you think? Oh, I just wanted to

1071
01:56:19,699 --> 01:56:22,980


1072
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,179


1073
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:27,119


1074
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:30,139


1075
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,600


1076
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,679


1077
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:35,520


1078
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,619
say thank you to the members, even though I’ve never said anything like this on the member stage since the moment I entered the trainee at this point in these 10 years.  To

1079
01:56:37,619 --> 01:56:39,980


1080
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,380
be honest,

1081
01:56:46,619 --> 01:56:49,199
I just had that thought while performing on stage

1082
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,960
. It was just amazing. Even though I

1083
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:54,000
came to Busan right now

1084
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,040


1085
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,260
, there was a moment where

1086
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:01,739
I didn’t really feel the moment that I came to my hometown and was with so many

1087
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:05,280
ARMYs.

1088
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:06,980


1089
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:09,770


1090
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:11,280
[Music] At that time, I

1091
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:14,280
thought a lot about the ARMYs,

1092
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:16,020
but the members came to mind

1093
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:18,900


1094
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:24,179


1095
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:29,639


1096
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:33,239
.

1097
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:34,940


1098
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:38,239


1099
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:41,060


1100
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:44,050


1101
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:47,110
[Applause]

1102
01:57:47,110 --> 01:57:49,020
[Music]

1103
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:51,480
Anyway,

1104
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:55,320
everyone and our

1105
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:58,159
BTS hyungs, you

1106
01:57:58,199 --> 01:57:59,880
've worked hard so far, it's

1107
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,340


1108
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,500
not the end

1109
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,320


1110
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:10,380
, it means we'll run further

1111
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,540
Yes, as Jimin hyung said earlier, I want

1112
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,460


1113
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,800


1114
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,159
to spend 10 more years with you for the next 10 years.

1115
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:22,699


1116
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,099


1117
01:58:29,099 --> 01:58:31,760


1118
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:38,300


1119
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,800


1120
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,360


1121
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:44,400


1122
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,599


1123
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:47,880
Take

1124
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,159


1125
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:52,940
care of yourself, take care of your health, and eat well

1126
01:58:57,239 --> 01:59:00,239
Yes I will make it this far I was

1127
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:03,060
so happy today

1128
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:05,300


1129
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,940
I love you ARMY

[Music]

1131
01:59:12,599 --> 01:59:14,040
I love you

BTS

01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:26,600
[Applause]

1134
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:32,840
Well,

1135
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:38,460
I’m old today

1136
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:41,420


1137
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:50,040


1138
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:53,659
.  No,

1139
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:57,719
now that I'm in my

1140
01:59:57,719 --> 02:00:00,480
30s, I think this idol is really

1141
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,450
raining.

1142
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:06,380
[Applause] During

1143
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:09,420
today's performance, I had a lot of

1144
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:11,940
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but this

1145
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:13,820
was

1146
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:16,619
the last concert we were holding

1147
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:19,020
.

1148
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:21,060


1149
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:22,980
I thought when would

1150
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:26,460
I be able to hold a concert like this again, and

1151
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:29,639
I thought I should spend a lot of time with

1152
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:32,159
this feeling and put a lot of these emotions into it

1153
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:33,739


1154
02:00:33,739 --> 02:00:35,360


1155
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,639


1156
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:40,260


1157
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:41,950
.

1158
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:45,200


1159
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:49,320
Okay, actually,

1160
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:50,099
for the past 12 weeks,

1161
02:00:50,099 --> 02:00:51,780
I have a very bad throat and neck condition, so

1162
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:54,900
I almost lived in an otolaryngology department

1163
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:55,580
.

1164
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:58,280
Oh, I prayed a lot.

1165
02:00:58,280 --> 02:01:00,900


1166
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:03,900


1167
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:05,099


1168
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:07,800


1169
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:10,920
My throat is so hard that I can't

1170
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,719


1171
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,760


1172
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:15,599


1173
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:17,219


1174
02:01:17,219 --> 02:01:19,860
even

1175
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:22,199


1176
02:01:22,199 --> 02:01:25,139
speak

1177
02:01:25,139 --> 02:01:26,280


1178
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:33,659
[Applause]

1179
02:01:33,659 --> 02:01:37,820
Yeah, so I really want to tell

1180
02:01:43,619 --> 02:01:46,440
you guys, I feel really lucky to have met you guys.

1181
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:49,500
Oh, and now

1182
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:52,099
, let's talk about one last thing.

1183
02:01:52,099 --> 02:01:55,080


1184
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,940


1185
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:58,500


1186
02:01:58,500 --> 02:01:59,250


1187
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:02,529


1188
02:02:06,599 --> 02:02:09,060
Actually, it's not a big album just because it's

1189
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:13,139
a single.

1190
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:18,480
I met someone I loved very much and this is how

1191
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:20,880
I made a song

1192
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:23,940
. Everyone, I've been

1193
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:25,739


1194
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:28,080
shooting a lot of things lately.

1195
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:30,659


1196
02:02:30,659 --> 02:02:34,699
I hope

1197
02:02:35,639 --> 02:02:39,119
today's performance was so enjoyable and

1198
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:40,630
thank you I love you

1199
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:48,390
[Applause] There

1200
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:55,500


1201
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:59,280
were many ups and downs at the Busan concert Anyway, the

1202
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,619
past is gone and the

1203
02:03:01,619 --> 02:03:04,020
past is just

1204
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:07,020


1205
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,719


1206
02:03:09,719 --> 02:03:12,739
a thing.  As we all know this and that and

1207
02:03:12,739 --> 02:03:15,659
this and that, while we were making this cue sheet

1208
02:03:15,659 --> 02:03:17,420


1209
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:20,639
, all of them are

1210
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:21,960
songs that we have been active with except for this Masiti.

1211
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,900


1212
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:25,920


1213
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,900
It

1214
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,820


1215
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,320
passed by like a dejuma lantern. They came

1216
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,280


1217
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,260
all the way from June 14, 2014, and

1218
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:36,239
now it's now October 15, 2022.

1219
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:38,280


1220
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:40,980
Oh, so it's

1221
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:44,400
still great.

1222
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,920


1223
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,540


1224
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:51,679


1225
02:03:52,619 --> 02:03:55,380
I think it’s good that

1226
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:59,719
some people really do what now BTS

1227
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:04,040
[Music]

1228
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:05,880
[Applause] It’s

1229
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:07,560
been about 6 years since we received the first grand prize,

1230
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:11,400
but if it’s 10 years

1231
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:13,500
, I think we will continue to be here for 20 or 30 years

1232
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,679


1233
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,400
.

1234
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:23,480
Let's grow old together,

1235
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,110
I love you

1236
02:04:28,110 --> 02:04:36,119
[Applause]

1237
02:04:36,119 --> 02:04:39,480
Last but not least, our bi-gun who attends again,

1238
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,320


1239
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,780
I

1240
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:45,260
really hate it, I really hate

1241
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:47,280
it, and feel the leader's attitude for

1242
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,960
once.

1243
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,179
[Applause]

1244
02:04:51,179 --> 02:04:55,219
I missed the

1245
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:57,900


1246
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,040


1247
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:04,080
ARMY.

1248
02:05:04,099 --> 02:05:07,199
While doing this concert with the members,

1249
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:10,860
I just had a question, but

1250
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:13,380
we were just in tears at our group dinner

1251
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:14,580


1252
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:17,760


1253
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,020


1254
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:21,119


1255
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:23,540
.

1256
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:28,069


1257
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:39,060


1258
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:41,159


1259
02:05:41,159 --> 02:05:42,599


1260
02:05:42,599 --> 02:05:45,480
I think I was thinking that Uh-

1261
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:47,159
Am would be

1262
02:05:47,159 --> 02:05:49,980
surprised to

1263
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:53,179
see our concert again because it was a

1264
02:05:53,179 --> 02:05:54,719
one-time thing for this concert, but

1265
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,540
we prepared a lot and run again

1266
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:00,139


1267
02:06:00,139 --> 02:06:03,360


1268
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,760
.

1269
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,619
I

1270
02:06:07,619 --> 02:06:10,570
had high expectations that the ARMYs would really like it. It was great

1271
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:15,500
[Applause] At the

1272
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:18,860
end,

1273
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:22,940
I couldn’t speak for a long time, so

1274
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,110
thank you for having it

1275
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:26,820

1276
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:29,520
such a big kid.

1277
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,699


1278
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:35,340


1279
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:40,199


1280
02:06:40,199 --> 02:06:42,239
As

1281
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:44,280
many people

1282
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:47,219
enjoyed playing together online, I hope today's performance will be of some help in promoting Busan and

1283
02:06:47,219 --> 02:06:50,099
attracting the World Expo

1284
02:06:50,099 --> 02:06:52,440
.

1285
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:54,119

1288
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:05,219
I have no doubt that this has become the best moment for us, too, and for BTS, in the

1289
02:07:05,219 --> 02:07:07,619


1290
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:09,780

1293
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:15,840
hopes that we will be together again at the most shining moment, I

1294
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,760
will listen to the last song of the day

1295
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,960
