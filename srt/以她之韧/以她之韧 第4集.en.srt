1
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,320
Boss.

2
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,039
Director Tang invites you over for dinner when you're free.

3
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,300
What a fake display of family affection.

4
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Exactly.

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,480
They clearly saw we absorbed the Hong Gang

6
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,280
and now they're eager for a piece of the pie.

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,039
Good thing you made arrangements in advance, Boss.

8
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,440
They'll only find old ledgers

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
and a pile of worthless junk.

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
Oh, right.

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
The Huo family sent a message.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
They said the measurements for the formal attire

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,440
were lost by their servants.

14
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,840
They're asking if you could go to the tailor shop again

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,300
to get measured in person.

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,440
Just to try on clothes?

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,040
Do I really need to go there myself?

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
Alright then.

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,960
I'll tell the second young lady

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,160
to figure it out herself.

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,440
By the way,

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
you asked me to investigate her.

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
She was indeed raised by fishermen.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,079
However...

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,240
However what?

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
That family didn't treat her well.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,900
She was often beaten and scolded.

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,100
Her life was quite miserable.

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,100
Did I ask you to find out if she had a hard life?

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
What I want to know is

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,760
why she's come back with such calculation

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,620
and what her true intentions are.

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
If you're suspicious of the Second Miss,

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,240
why let her get involved with the engagement party?

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,400
Aren't you afraid she'll sabotage it?

36
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,079
It's better to keep dangerous things close where you can watch them.

37
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,720
That's all. You may go now.

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,440
Second Miss, this is the pipa.

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,100
The First Miss specifically asked you to take it for maintenance.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
She wants to play it herself on the day of the banquet.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,000
Please be careful.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,560
This pipa

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,400
was left by the madam for the young miss.

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
The young miss's skill

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,360
truly lives up to her mother's teaching.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Don't damage it.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
This is mother's favorite pipa.

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
It's fine.

49
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
Here.

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
Do you like it?

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Let me try it.

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Our young miss doesn't like the pipa.

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,500
The madam's musical skills were wasted.

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Who would have thought a new miss would come

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,260
who has such a connection with the madam.

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
Unfortunately, this new miss...

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Actually...

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
Well...

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
Oh no!

61
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,620
Miss, are you alright?

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,380
It was perfectly fine.

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
How could you?

64
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
This is the young miss's favorite pipa.

65
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,920
What happened?

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Oh!

67
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,760
Young miss, please don't worry.

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll have someone replace the strings right away.

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
You did that on purpose.

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes. I don't like it.

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm not happy.

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,440
Do you know

73
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,520
every string was tuned by my mother herself,

74
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,970
every crack was repaired by her own hands?

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,060
Go kneel in the ancestral hall

76
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,410
and apologize to my mother.

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,480
A fake heiress

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
actually treating someone else's mother as her own.

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,880
What did you say?

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,960
I said

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,400
I'll go.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,280
Hand it over.

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
Mr. Wen, you're here.

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,080
Please.

85
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,760
When you broke into my warehouse that day,

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
you weren't this polite.

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,140
Mr. Wen knew I was from the Huo family,

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
but deliberately didn't mention you're the Huo family's son-in-law.

89
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,680
Didn't you just want to see my surprised reaction?

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,540
Since you're my brother-in-law,

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,490
I should naturally be more polite.

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
Your time is valuable.

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Let's begin.

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm scared.

95
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll do it myself.

96
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,440
If you're thirsty,

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,960
I can pour you some water.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,880
That won't be necessary.

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,970
Who knows if you'll put something in my drink.

100
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
What did you do to me?

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Brother-in-law,

102
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
are you afraid?

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Thank you,

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,240
brother-in-law.

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,930
Boss, what's wrong?

106
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,460
Something serious has happened.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
Get up.

108
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's go.

109
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,680
Later,

110
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,200
I escaped.

111
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Hello.

112
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,960
Okay.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
I slept under bridges

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
and fought with stray dogs for spoiled food.

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,920
When I was twelve,

116
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,080
I learned to stage accidents and steal wallets.

117
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Stop!

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,800
Don't run!

119
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,960
When the patrol officer's baton came down,

120
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,080
I didn't shed a single tear.

121
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
But every time

122
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
whenever I closed my eyes,

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
I would see you letting go of my hand.

124
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
Mom, help me!

125
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Jiayu.

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
Huoran.

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,280
Mom!

128
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
But it doesn't matter.

129
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
Now that I'm back,

130
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,820
I won't give up easily.

131
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Sister,

132
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,200
since that marriage arrangement is what matters most to you,

133
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,970
I'll destroy it.

134
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,210
Something terrible has happened!

135
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
There's trouble.

136
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,440
Song Jiayu.

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,560
Damn it!

138
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
If we let this slide,

139
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,410
others will surely look down on us.

140
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,610
Where would the Huo family put their face?

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
But if we don't tolerate it,

142
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,280
the Dragon Tiger Gang and Tang Jing will both harm the Huo family.

143
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,610
Such a simple logic,

144
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,340
don't you understand?

145
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,330
Don't think I'll treat you like my real daughter.

146
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,080
If you lose your usefulness,

147
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,040
you know the consequences.

148
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Hmph!

149
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,120
Mother,

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,260
when you abandoned me,

151
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,640
did you ever think

152
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,240
that one day I would return to this house?

153
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,100
Is Huo Ran really that wonderful,

154
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,140
so wonderful that for her sake

155
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,340
you would abandon your own daughter?

156
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
Do you want to hear

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,930
how I've survived all these years?

158
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,740
Back then, when the train broke down.

159
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
I was all alone

160
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,400
wandering through the wilderness.

161
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,280
Later I passed out from fear.

162
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,160
Fortunately,

163
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,280
there was a fishing village nearby.

164
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,840
A passing fisherman rescued me.

165
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,000
But to my surprise,

166
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
he immediately sold me to traffickers

167
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,080
for just one bag of brown rice.

168
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,330
How about it? Can you add a bit more?

169
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,280
A little fool like this

170
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,440
is only worth this much.
