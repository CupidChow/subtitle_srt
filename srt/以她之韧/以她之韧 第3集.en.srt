1
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Bang.

2
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,720
She's right.

3
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,000
You saved my life.

4
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,980
Don't kill him.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,160
Boss.

6
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,520
Boss.

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
When we were cleaning up the scene,

8
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,160
I found a suspicious person.

9
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,289
He confessed that he works for Mr. Huo.

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,320
Lady Ruoxi, help me.

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,200
Save you?

12
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,880
You did this to me.

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
Do you think I'm a living Bodhisattva?

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
So you are

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
who just came back.

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,340
For the sake of the Huo family,

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I'll send you off.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,280
Thank you.

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,440
Please.

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
I don't have a father.

21
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,360
I don't want to go home.

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
I don't have a father.

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,700
I don't want to go home.

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
Don't kill me.

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,760
Don't kill me!

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Master.

27
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
You're awake.

28
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,680
Yes.

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,800
There are people searching the street.

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
If you wake up,

31
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
run away.

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
A coward who doesn't dare to go home.

33
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,080
What do you know?

34
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,010
Of course I know.

35
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
Because

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I have a home too.

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
I must go back.

38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Lady Ruan.

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,810
I saved someone before.

40
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,320
I don't remember.

41
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,280
Maybe.

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,040
It's easy.

43
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Good.

44
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,160
You forgot about me.

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,880
Do me a favor.

46
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,159
Sure.

47
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,000
How?

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,240
We're even now.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
See you again.

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,840
See you again.

51
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
So

52
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,760
this is the home she always wanted to go back to.

53
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,880
Master.

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
Don't be too anxious.

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,480
Jiayu is just a kid.

56
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
Maybe she was playful.

57
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
When you've had enough fun,

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
you'll come back.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Okay.

60
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,840
Master!

61
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,120
Lady Ruoxi is back.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
Dad, I'm back.

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
What's wrong?

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,560
Jiayu.

65
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,770
Call the doctor!

66
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,880
What happened?

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Nothing.

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,200
I just

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
wandering around.

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,000
but I ran into a robber.

71
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,000
Luckily someone saved me.

72
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,680
A kind person?

73
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,320
Master.

74
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,500
Mr. Wen is here.

75
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Ruyan.

76
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,960
Salute?

77
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,880
Is he Wen Liyan, the leader of Dragon Tiger Gang?

78
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,920
Did you save Jiayu?

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
It's me.

80
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,159
Okay.

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
We are a family.

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,920
Thank you.

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,960
You don't have to thank me.

84
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Jiayu.

85
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,940
I forgot to introduce you.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,280
Liyan is Ran's fiance.

87
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,890
He'll be your brother-in-law from now on.

88
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,960
By the way,

89
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,880
I ran into Lady Ruan when I was passing by.

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,040
I even brought the thief back.

91
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,720
This thief is really bold.

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
Not only did he kidnap Lady Ruan,

93
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
but also framed her.

94
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
He said Huo Zhi Jie was behind it.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,080
No.

96
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
It wasn't me.

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
The courtesy also said that it's just a cling.

98
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,240
It must be that servant's idea.

99
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,620
It has nothing to do with Zhi Jie, Master.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
Aunt Mei is right.

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,700
You have to discipline the servants.

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
Don't ruin your reputation.

103
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Although I'm wronged,

104
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
Zhi Jie,

105
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,450
you have the duty to discipline the servants.

106
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,560
Go and reflect on your mistakes.

107
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
The Southeast Water Road

108
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
to your sister.

109
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
No, Dad.

110
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,800
Besides,

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,760
she's fine too.

112
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,760
Shut up.

113
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,380
Steward Zhong.

114
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Take him away.

115
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes.

116
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,040
Help!

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Zhijie.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,160
Master.

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,720
Mom

120
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
Zhi Jie.

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
Ran, please take care of the waterway.

122
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,560
Your wedding with Liyan is coming.

123
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
We are family.

124
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,760
It's a token of appreciation.

125
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,700
Thank you, Father.

126
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
It's late.

127
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,300
Send the gift message.

128
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,080
Salute?

129
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Say hello to Mr. Tang for me.

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Goodbye.

131
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,480
My injury

132
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,340
I made a wedding dress for others.

133
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,920
What a good brother-in-law.

134
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,520
It's late.

135
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,600
Rest early.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll remember your kindness.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,040
Are you talking about the waterway?

138
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
or I saved your sister?

139
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,360
See you.

140
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,960
By the way,

141
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
your sister is very interesting.

142
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,540
Lady Ruoxi, let me change your dressing.

143
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,210
Why are you here?

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
Come and see my good sister.

145
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,320
Can't I?

146
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
You don't have to do this.

147
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,520
The knife wound on your arm

148
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,050
was not stabbed by a robber, right?

149
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,050
If you don't want to make it public,

150
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,840
let me in.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,760
What do you mean?

152
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,000
If you really don't know what I mean,

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,490
you wouldn't have let me in.

154
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,520
Right?

155
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
This wound is pretty.

156
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,880
Slice it three inches.

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,720
You can do this?

158
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
To be precise,

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,560
it should be you.

160
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,760
holding someone's hand.

161
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
You saw it with your own eyes.

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,280
No.

163
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
That's a good story.

164
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,960
I've been hurt a lot more than you think.

165
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,160
I can tell

166
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,600
your wound.

167
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,800
Song Jiayu.

168
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,860
I don't like beating around the bush.

169
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,680
What's your purpose

170
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,840
to break into Huo family?

171
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,640
What purpose can I have?

172
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,000
I just want a home.

173
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,640
A real home.

174
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,600
From the first day I met you,

175
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,840
the first day I saw you.

176
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,280
Just like this.

177
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,080
This wound...

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,320
for?

179
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
You're so smart.

180
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,000
Why don't you guess?

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,040
If I fail,

182
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,040
I'll be the unlucky one.

183
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,960
or you?

184
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,640
While I'm still being nice to you.

185
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,480
I can give you

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
I can give it to you.

187
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,840
Don't you know

188
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,680
what I want?

189
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,000
Money and money are so boring.

190
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,200
Power is the best honor for a woman.

191
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,280
That's what you do.

192
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,560
Otherwise,

193
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,650
he wouldn't have asked the Longhu Gang to rely on him.

194
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
I knew it.

195
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,840
A person who has no blood ties

196
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,440
in this family,

197
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,480
in this house?

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,960
It's because of men.

199
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,440
Song Jiayu.

200
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,520
I'm here.

201
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,440
you won't succeed.

202
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,960
Miss Leng.

203
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,930
You have a telegram.

204
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,040
Take care of the rest.

205
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
I won't bother you.

206
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
Take care.

207
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,640
If you think I rely on men,

208
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,080
you should prepare my engagement banquet.

209
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
My dear sister.
