1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,759
Who are you?

2
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,640
Stay back!

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,039
I won't hurt you.

4
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,720
Don't worry.

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,970
I won't take it away.

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
I'll keep it somewhere safe for you.

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
Where am I now?

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,419
This is the outskirts of the city.

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
You're in my home.

10
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,640
I saved you.

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,920
I need to leave.

12
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,400
I need to go back.

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
You're seriously injured.

14
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,340
Don't move.

15
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,079
Good thing I can change my voice.

16
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,260
So she won't recognize me.

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Lean back for now.

18
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,079
Here.

19
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Move back.

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,520
Careful!

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Don't worry.

22
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,600
It's safe here.

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,520
You can rest and recover here.

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,320
The doctor said your eyes will be fine.

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,810
You just need to rest properly.

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,240
These are the medicines prescribed by the doctor.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,570
Drink it while it's hot.

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,770
Open your mouth.

29
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,800
Sister, you're amazing!

30
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,050
If you don't like it,

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,930
we can stop playing.

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Oh, no!

33
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,850
I didn't say I don't like it.

34
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,420
If that's the case,

35
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,690
why are you pretending?

36
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
Your chess skills are actually quite good,

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,700
yet you're acting like you know nothing.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
Why?

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,130
I just wanted to make you happy.

40
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,000
So in your mind, I can't handle losing?

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
No.

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,490
Sister, I was wrong.

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Let's play again.

44
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,760
The outcome is clear.

45
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,440
Why waste more time?

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,400
What?

47
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
The Oriole Chasing Butterfly move, right?

48
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh no.

49
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,080
Both Jiayu and I learned Go from our mother.

50
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,090
Could she have noticed something?

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,100
The Oriole Chasing Butterfly

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,930
seems harmless,

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,060
beautiful and ornate,

54
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,900
but it's actually a killing move.

55
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Sister, this game

56
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
is a draw.

57
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,200
Actually,

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
my mother taught me this move.

59
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,250
This way the medicine won't taste bitter.

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,120
Try it.

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,320
Careful.

62
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
Take it slow.

63
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,240
You should get some rest now.

64
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,520
I'll be going.

65
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,840
Wait.

66
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,159
What should I call you?

67
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
You're younger than me.

68
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,770
Just call me sister.

69
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,040
Sister.

70
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,960
Thank you.

71
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,600
Good night.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Good night.

73
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Let's play a game.

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
I found something interesting.

75
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,290
The black pieces are rough,

76
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,960
while the white ones are smooth.

77
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,000
The board has markings on it,

78
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,120
so even if you can't see, you can feel where to place them.

79
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
To help pass your time.

80
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,640
Okay.

81
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
Wait a moment.

82
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
I can do this.

83
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
I'll come to you.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Got it!

85
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,840
Because

86
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,860
you're standing in the light.

87
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,960
You're the one in the light.

88
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
Oh no, I lost.

89
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Sister.

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Your mother seems very talented.

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,330
She's skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

92
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,960
My mother excels at everything she does.

93
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,049
You're the same.

94
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,929
I'm nowhere near her level.

95
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,240
If she had a choice,

96
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,600
perhaps

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,850
she would prefer someone else to be her daughter.

98
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Who?

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,720
A thief.

100
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
When I was little,

101
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,050
I was jealous of her.

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
I felt that

103
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,560
despite having nothing,

104
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,120
she was so smart and quick to learn.

105
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
I spent three months practicing the piano,

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,480
but she surpassed me in just three days.

107
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Compared to me,

108
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,020
she seemed more like my mother's biological daughter.

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Before,

110
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,600
I always thought

111
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
that no matter what,

112
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,360
she could never match me.

113
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
After all, I was the biological one.

114
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Until that day,

115
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,360
I realized

116
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,440
how terribly wrong I was.

117
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,800
It turns out

118
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,120
someone can so easily

119
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
steal another person's life.

120
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
Do you hate her?

121
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,840
Who would forgive someone

122
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,760
who secretly wants them dead?

123
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,170
Neither of us will let the other go.

124
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,320
It's either her or me.

125
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Hmm.

126
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
Haven't found them yet.

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,160
We must find those people

128
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,440
and eliminate them.

129
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Baoxian Pastries

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Hey,

131
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
let me see.

132
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't move.

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I wish you were really my sister.

134
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
Don't touch water for three days.

135
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,500
Thank you, sister.

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,200
Don't worry, Miss.

137
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,090
Everything has been taken care of.

138
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
In the master's view,

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,930
the second young lady was falsely accused

140
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
and is completely innocent.

141
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,220
The bribes have been paid,

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,600
and we've found a scapegoat.

143
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,380
The police will be satisfied.

144
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,930
Before long,

145
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,600
this matter will be settled.

146
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Keep investigating.

147
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,450
We must find who committed the murder.

148
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,840
Yes.

149
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,640
No matter who it is,

150
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,120
they must pay the price.
