1
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,840
Don't worry.

2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,160
I'll make sure to deliver them safely to the provincial capital.

3
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,440
There's one more.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,720
What's this?

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,440
A grand gift from Huo Ran.

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Bastard!

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,320
It's all your fault!

8
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,320
Young master, get out of the way!

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,560
It's all because A Guang was blind and foolish,

10
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,530
following such a beast.

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
What?

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,130
So your surprise is just bringing me home?

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,200
Home.

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Don't forget,

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,680
I've been blind here for two days.

16
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,620
I can even remember

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
the exact sound of you opening the door.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
Hey, be careful.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't open your eyes yet.

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,720
Okay, now.

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,700
Is this to celebrate our escape from misery?

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,400
I knew you'd forget.

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
Happy birthday.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,480
Oh, right.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,560
Try it.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,720
How is it?

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,540
It's a bit strange.

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Then don't eat it.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
Huo Ran,

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
did you make this?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
No.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,840
Look.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,160
That's the Big Dipper.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,800
I used to love stargazing.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
Why?

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
The elders say.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
Lost travelers who follow the direction of the Big Dipper

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,730
can find their way home.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
I used to stare at them

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,040
praying over and over again.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,480
Praying it would bring you back.

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,210
You were born with everything.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,370
While I had nothing.

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
It's so strange.

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,820
I was so jealous of you.

46
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,360
Yet I still wanted you to come back.

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,140
If we're talking about jealousy,

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,500
I should be the one jealous of you.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
You were so smart,

50
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,300
could learn anything,

51
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,220
mastered everything.

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
When I was little,

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,480
I always felt

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,880
you were more like mom's daughter than I was.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,140
Thinking about it now,

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,220
it was really foolish.

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,400
Yes,

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
so foolish.

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,600
But gradually,

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,970
I stopped wanting you to come back.

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,800
The Huo family is hell.

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,050
I've been negotiating with Huo Tingshan for a long time.

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,740
Many times I thought victory was in my grasp,

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
but I never expected

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,810
he would be much more

66
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
terrifying than I imagined.

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
No wonder

68
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,920
you kept trying to make me leave.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
To survive in the Huo family,

70
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,409
I've done too many dirty deeds for him.

71
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,600
My hands are stained with countless blood.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
But despite all that,

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,140
he's still extremely cautious of me.

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,240
You can see how deep his scheming goes.

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,640
Once he has his eye on you,

76
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,520
if he can't use you,

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
there's only death waiting.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,960
But right now is the best opportunity.

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
With Tang Jing's downfall

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,170
before the new director takes office,

81
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,120
Yun City will surely fall into chaos.

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
It will tie up Huo Tingshan's hands.

83
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,120
I know you're skilled,

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
even if you stay with the Huo family,

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,900
you can protect yourself.

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
But your talents

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,210
shouldn't be wasted in this place.

88
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,140
The Huo family is like a quagmire.

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,040
Once trapped in it, you'll be devoured.

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,000
Deception and scheming

91
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
these conspiracies are mere techniques,

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,760
not the true way.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
No matter how beautifully an oriole sings,

94
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,640
it's still just a caged bird.

95
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,570
If you want to be an eagle in the sky,

96
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,480
you must soar through the heavens

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,100
and fly to farther places.

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,280
My second wish

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
is for you to leave this place.

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Alright.

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
I promise you.

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
However,

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
you have to come with me.

104
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
I can't leave anymore.

105
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,320
Sister.

106
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Sister.

107
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,680
The bag.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,440
Huo Tingshan is controlling you with drugs.

109
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
He knows

110
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,100
when mother was alive,

111
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,880
she was my weakness.

112
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,040
That's it then.

113
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Make a wish.

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
My wish is

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,240
for Huo Ran to make a wish.

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,370
Today is your birthday too.

117
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,560
You forgot?

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,480
Actually, before coming to the Huo family,

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,680
I didn't even know when my birthday was.

120
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,280
That year,

121
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,400
my mother was the one who told me.

122
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
Well...

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,640
I'll give you my wish.

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
So you'll have two wishes now.

125
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
Come with me to a place.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
This is my first wish.

127
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Hmm.

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,340
Whatever the birthday person wants.

129
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,520
After my mother passed away,

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,880
I became fearless.

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,039
He used my mother to threaten me,

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,400
controlled me with poison.

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
Only this way

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,960
could he control me for long.

135
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,520
Huo Ran,

136
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
I will leave,

137
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,800
but not now.

138
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,610
Even if you're in the deepest hell,

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
I'll pull you out.

140
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,480
Alright.

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
Song Jiayu,

142
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
come save me.

143
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,560
No.

144
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,700
Director Tang.

145
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,600
Oh no.

146
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Former Director.

147
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
No.

148
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,280
Impossible.

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,080
It's you.

150
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,160
You've collected so much evidence of Tang Jing's crimes.

151
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,920
The Huo family is Tang Jing's right hand.

152
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
No wonder

153
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,960
you want to marry Huo Ran.

154
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
After all these years,

155
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,370
I've been waiting for this day.

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
Young Master,

157
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
I humbly request

158
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,940
to join the Dragon Tiger Gang.

159
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Rise.

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,440
Thank you, Young Master.

161
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,400
Great!

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,330
Tang has fallen.

163
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,440
Ptui! Corrupt official!

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
Corrupt official. He deserves it.

165
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,050
Ptui! What bad luck.

166
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,980
Heaven truly has eyes.

167
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,490
Indeed. He deserved to die.

168
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
It seems

169
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
this is the best ending for you.

170
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
Unable to live,

171
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,840
unable to die.

172
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,760
I won't kill you,

173
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
because killing a beast like you

174
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
would dirty my hands.

175
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,520
Tang Jing.

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
About what happened before,

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,020
I want to apologize to you.

178
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,810
Actually, it's not that I don't trust you.

179
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
It's just that for so many years,

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,530
I've grown accustomed to being alone.

181
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,960
Having companions

182
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,520
means exposing your vulnerabilities.

183
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Once betrayed,

184
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,370
there's no coming back.

185
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
Sometimes I wonder

186
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,010
if this is heaven's punishment for me.

187
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Why?

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,120
Why would you think that way?

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,680
When my mother was alive,

190
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,200
I lived under her protection.

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,600
She always tried her best

192
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,640
to support me.

193
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,440


194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
I often think

195
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,240
if I had been more attentive,

196
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,480
if I had done better,

197
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,240
would the outcome have been different?

198
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,920
This time...

199
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,840
The outcome will definitely be different.

200
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,400
Trust me.
