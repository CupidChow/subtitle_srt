1
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,080
Ms Huo.

2
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Stop pretending.

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,640
Ms Huo.

4
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,960
I don't understand what you're talking about.

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Ms Huo.

6
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,490
Didn't you just call me sister?

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Really?

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,240
You work for Mei Ying?

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,759
What?

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,520
Are you here today

11
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
to come here today?

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,080
Ms Huo.

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,440
You think too much.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,600
Put this on.

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,960
Okay.

16
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,680
Ms Huo,

17
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,280
Could you please excuse us?

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,020
They are all women.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,260
What are you afraid of?

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,079
A poor fisher girl

21
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,300
Do you know how to wear cheongsam?

22
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
He has a scar on his shoulder.

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,730
I don't know what happened.

24
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Mom.

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,280
Where are we going?

26
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,360
For what?

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
It's about adults.

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
Don't ask too much.

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
But I don't want to leave here.

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
I don't want to leave.

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
Let's sit back.

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
Why didn't mom tell us

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,520
where to take us?

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,960
She has her own reason.

35
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,690
Stop asking.

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
She's my mom.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
I can ask her whatever I want.

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,220
None of your business.

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,040
Since you came to our house,

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
nothing good happened.

41
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
Let me tell you.

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
I already know.

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
I want to send you away.

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,500
and send you back to the garbage pile.

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Mom will send you away soon.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,520
Just wait.

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,560
Go away.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,820
None of your business.

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,880
I'm done.

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,160
What are you doing?

51
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
Good acting.

52
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,440
Same to you.

53
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,400
Sister.

54
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
Do you remember?

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,440
This time,

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,760
I will take back everything that belongs to me.

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,040
Miss Song, have you changed your clothes?

58
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,370
Master wants to see you.

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,800
Coming.

60
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
Thank God

61
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,280
for making me suffer.

62
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,000
so that I can

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,240
in my life.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,200
Here.

65
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,280
Greetings, ancestors.

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Yes.

67
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,600
Jiayu,

68
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,240
Now that you've returned to the Huo family,

69
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
This name...

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
Father.

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,360
Jiayu has been used for a long time.

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm used to it.

73
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Don't bother.

74
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,240
Okay.

75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
Whatever you call her, she's my good daughter.

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,840
Yes.

77
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,240
Bah.

78
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Hey.

79
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
Jiayu,

80
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,080
Bow to your mother again.

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,000
If she can see you like this today,

82
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,880
she would be very happy.

83
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,080
Really?

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Mother.

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,840
Back then,

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,280
if you hadn't abandoned me,

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,280
I wouldn't be like this today.

88
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,000
I really want you to see

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,040
how I got from the daughter you chose.

90
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,560
I took back

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,040
that belongs to me.

92
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Father.

93
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,520
I never thought

94
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
that I could return to my ancestors one day.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,480
I have to thank you for everything.

96
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,680
Jiayu.

97
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
You're really sensible.

98
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,040
Song Jiayu.

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,040
As long as I'm here,

100
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,360
the door of the Huo family won't open for you.

101
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,960
You look so radiant.

102
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Here's to you.

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,400
A toast to you.

104
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,800
Thank you.

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,159
This banquet

106
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,840
to finish the shipping order.

107
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,240
An unknown wild girl

108
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,620
Why is she showing off?

109
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Miss, don't be sad.

110
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,760
I'll teach her a lesson.

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Come back.

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,400
Miss.

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,960
The opponent hasn't shown his trump card yet.

114
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Let's not panic.

115
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
A fisherwoman

116
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
is too relaxed

117
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,040
in such a situation?

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Miss.

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,560
Are you suspecting her identity?

120
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,280
I see.

121
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,880
You're welcome.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm counting on you.

123
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,679
Bah.

124
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,040
Huo Ran is not enough.

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,740
Now there's another one who wants to compete with me for the family property.

126
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,640
I can't beat Huo Ran.

127
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
Can't you beat a fisherwoman?

128
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,800
I'll show you what happens if you block my way.

129
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,920
Miss.

130
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,360
Yes?

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,490
Master asked me to take you somewhere.

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,760
Father.

133
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,480
Yes.

134
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,640
But the banquet is not over yet.

135
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,200
Please.

136
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,460
Where is my dad?

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,100
Where are we going?

138
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,800
Master is waiting for you at the destination.

139
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,530
You'll know when you get there.

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,960
Please stop the car.

141
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,420
I need to use the bathroom.

142
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
Wait here.

143
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,480
Take my bag.

144
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,540
I'll be right back.

145
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,560
Okay.

146
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Stop! Stop!

147
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Stop!

148
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
I didn't expect

149
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Young Master Wen dares to go alone.

150
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,320
Master Hong's invitation.

151
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
I dare not neglect the courtesy.

152
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,680
Our gang has never

153
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
never interfere with each other.

154
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,570
How dare you cross the line and steal my business?

155
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,840
Can you swallow the goods at the west dock?

156
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,600
Don't choke.

157
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,160
Master Hong's goods are a bit slow.

158
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,730
I just changed it to land route for you.

159
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,740
If the Dragon and Tiger Gang wants my territory,

160
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,680
I have to risk my life.

161
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,840
Five bullets.

162
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,960
If you win, you can have the goods.

163
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,360
If you die,

164
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,450
Dragon and Tiger Gang will be mine.

165
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,040
Do you dare?

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,880
Master Hong.

167
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,040
Why don't we play bigger?

168
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,280
Empty.

169
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Do you dare?

170
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,040
You have guts.

171
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,480
Looks like

172
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,320
Guan Yu

173
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
is on my side.

174
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,840
It's your turn.

175
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,200
Mr. Wen.

176
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,840
What a pity.

177
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,090
Although he is an illegitimate child,

178
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,720
he's the only son of Tang Jing.

179
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Otherwise, for his sake,

180
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,160
for his sake,

181
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
I'll spare your life.

182
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,200
You talk too much.

183
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,120
Bad luck.

184
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,440
Oh no.

185
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,400
My necklace!

186
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,080
Boss.

187
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,400
God is helping us.

188
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Not God.

189
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,840
Yes.

190
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,080
Come out.

191
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,760
How dare you!

192
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,560
I'm gambling.

193
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
a powerful gang won't be ungrateful.

194
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,640
In that case,

195
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,320
should I thank you

196
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,560
who saved my life?

197
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,480
No need.

198
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm just looking for something.

199
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
For this?

200
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,330
Are you waiting for me to say thank you?

201
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,200
Thank you.

202
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
You little girl.

203
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,680
Boss.

204
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
Cut the crap.

205
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
I'll do it myself.
