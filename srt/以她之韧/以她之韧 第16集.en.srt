1
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
Just returning a favor.

2
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A favor?

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,960
You're being too polite.

4
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Between us, there are no favors.

5
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,000
It's all business.

6
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,840
I know.

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
You navigate around the Huo family.

8
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,120
Maneuvering between me and Huo Ran.

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,780
You must have your own agenda.

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,009
The person you really want to deal with

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,400
is Tang Jing, isn't it?

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,660
Seems I guessed right.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,530
What do you want to know?

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,340
I don't want to know anything.

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,280
Everyone has their secrets.

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,240
You don't need to explain yourself to anyone.

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
The motive isn't what matters most.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
What matters is the destination.

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,320
It seems

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,180
I should reconsider your proposal from that night.

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,800
To make you

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,160
the sharpest knife in my hand.

23
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,960
So?

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,440
For you,

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,850
what does this mean?

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,800
A new

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
mutually beneficial

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
cooperation.

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,320
Exactly.

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,920
That's right.

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,400
What favor?

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,200
You clearly heard about the Huo family lockdown

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,000
and went to check on the second miss because you were worried.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,920
Enough.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,640
Boss.

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,640
Why don't you tell the second miss

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,520
that you've met her before?

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Why should I tell her?

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,690
Even if you don't mention the past,

40
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,340
just focus on the present,

41
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,170
you should still let her know how good you've been to her.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
No need.

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,440
She's right.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,370
I already have a grudge against Tang Jing.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,570
And I have other motives for coming to the Huo family.

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,250
My intentions were never pure.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,200
In the future,

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,560
don't mention this to me again.

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,839
Yes.

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,160
Miss Huo,

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
a guest

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,130
asked me to give you something.

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,450
She said if you insist on staying here,

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,320
then

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,960
better to die with honor than live in disgrace.

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
She's threatening me with her life.

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,280
Wen Liyan,

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,159
let's talk.

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,360
Alright.

60
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
Why are you helping me?

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
Now I'm back.

62
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,800
She told me

63
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
that there was only cooperation between us,

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
so what favor was there to repay?

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,080
But I want to tell you

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
what I repaid

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
was Song Jiayu's favor from three years ago.

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,080
Later I returned to Yun City.

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,760
Tang Jing, that beast,

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
he used the lives of my Dragon Tiger Gang brothers

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,420
to blackmail me into working for him.

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,520
I had no choice but to obey him.

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,720
So under his control, the Dragon Tiger Gang

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
did many dirty deeds,

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,200
straying far from my master's original intentions.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,240
Between Tang Jing and me,

77
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,640
it's a fight to the death.

78
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,400
One day,

79
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,340
I will take back the Dragon Tiger Gang

80
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,060
and make him pay the price.

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,680
I've made up my mind.

82
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,210
Let's work together again.

83
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
Tang Jing thinks

84
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,980
he can rule Yun City with an iron fist.

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
Then we

86
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,130
will bring down his empire.

87
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
Hmm.

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
Alright.

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,640
Now that we're partners,

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,770
let me tell you a secret.

91
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,320
Three years ago, I said that on purpose.

92
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,040
What do you mean?

93
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
At that time,

94
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,760
you were burning with fever,

95
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,289
lying on the ground talking nonsense.

96
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,200
That's when I knew

97
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
we were the same kind of people.

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,880
No matter how badly wounded,

99
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,920
we would never easily give up.

100
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,560
With just a little provocation,

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
you would stand up again.

102
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,400
As it turns out,

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,520
I was right.

104
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,960
Wen Liyan,

105
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
three years ago,

106
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,560
I already saw your true self.

107
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
This person is

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
Tang Jing.

109
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,880
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
It's okay.

111
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,120
Since I brought you here,

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,100
I don't want to hide anything.

113
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Everyone knows

114
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
Tang Jing is your father.

115
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
But it seems

116
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,380
few people ever mention your mother.

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,880
Back then,

118
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,760
he had a promising future.

119
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
My mother

120
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
was a boat prostitute.

121
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,940
He thought it was just a one-night stand,

122
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,720
but unexpectedly,

123
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,240
she gave birth to me, his bastard child.

124
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
Later, my mother became seriously ill.

125
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,000
She knelt on the ground

126
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
begging Tang Jing to feed me.

127
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,640
If you're awake,

128
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,450
you'd better run for your life.

129
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
You're a coward who's afraid to go home.

130
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,610
What do you know?

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,330
Of course I understand.

132
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Because

133
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
I have a home too.

134
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
I must go back.

135
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,800
Indeed.

136
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Your words hurt me.

137
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,200
But I couldn't argue against it.

138
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
She also told me

139
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,260
that she had a home she must return to as well.

140
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,440
Perhaps it was that sentence

141
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,120
that gave me a bit of courage.

142
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,480
I'll never forget.

143
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,080
That period

144
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,200
was the most miserable time of my life.

145
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,440
I was like a stray dog,

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,400
completely disheveled,

147
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
lost my way.

148
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
But that girl?

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,360
She didn't even glance at me.

150
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
Her mockery was probably right.

151
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,160
I was indeed a coward.

152
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,420
So from that moment on,

153
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,280
in my heart,

154
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,600
I held onto that frustration.

155
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
Therefore,

156
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,930
I only know that half an hour

157
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,520
is enough time to destroy your family's shipment.

158
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Miss Huo,

159
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,920
don't you agree?

160
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,610
You think I care about that?

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,200
If you want it,

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
just take it.

163
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,960
Wen Liyan,

164
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,520
what gives you the right to take her away?

165
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,720
And what gives you the right to take her?

166
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,610
Because I'm her sister.

167
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,000
You're her sister,

168
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,240
yet you drugged her.

169
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm asking you one last time.

170
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,960
Where is she?

171
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,640
If you dare,

172
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,840
then pull the trigger.

173
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,000
But Tang Jing

174
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,180
looked down on my mother's humble status

175
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,560
and drove us out of the house.

176
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Later,

177
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
my mother

178
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,920
died.

179
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,780
I became homeless.

180
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,720
Until I was at death's door,

181
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
a man appeared before me.

182
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
He was the previous leader of the Dragon Tiger Gang,

183
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Jiang Huai.

184
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,160
He took me in.

185
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
He was your master?

186
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,120
My master saved me.

187
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,520
He saved my life.

188
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,960
But what did I do?

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,520
I got him killed.

190
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,680
It's truly ironic.

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,760
Tang Jing...

192
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,000
He had many sons,

193
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,920
but every one of them died.

194
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,560
Just when the Tang family line was about to end,

195
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,040
he finally thought of me.

196
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,780
He forced me to return.

197
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,960
But I refused.

198
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,380
So he killed my master.

199
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
My master,

200
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
before he fell, his last word

201
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,960
was 'run.'

202
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,200
He told me to run.

203
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,880
I ran south,

204
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,800
never looking back.

205
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,220
I kept running.

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
Running and running.

207
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,360
Until my feet were raw and bleeding,

208
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
until I collapsed from exhaustion.

209
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,100
I developed a fever again.

210
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,480
With no other choice,

211
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
I hid in a dilapidated house.

212
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,240
In this rundown place,

213
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
there was a girl.

214
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,200
She said to me,

215
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,800
Hey,

216
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,760
you coward who won't go home.

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,240
That person from three years ago

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
was you.

219
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
People were searching the streets.
