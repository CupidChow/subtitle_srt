1
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,840
What do you mean by that?

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,170
The most urgent task now

3
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,440
is to distance ourselves from Tang Jing

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,039
so everyone can see the Huo family's position.

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,080
Yes.

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,560
You're right.

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,220
Someone come here!

8
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,940
Find all the related items

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and burn them all.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Don't worry, Father.

11
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Wen Liyan, what urgent matter do you have?

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
I should have known it was you.

13
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,520
I'll give you one sentence worth of time.

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,560
Do you hate me?

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,770
If I say I don't hate you,

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
would you believe me?

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,039
Huo Ran,

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
I truly hate you.

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
That's good.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,760
Keep hating me.

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,740
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

22
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,140
Go ahead and shoot.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
As you wish.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,079
What's wrong?

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,840
Surprised?

26
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,040
That day at the casino entrance,

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,220
your gun didn't have bullets either, did it?

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,640
Huo Ran,

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
would you rather die than explain things to me?

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
Am I that untrustworthy?

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Your plan was flawless.

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,690
I just needed to act like a fool and everything would be fine.

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,520
But you never asked me

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,880
if I was willing to do it.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,560
What about you?

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,040
When have you ever considered my feelings?

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,800
Acting recklessly, disregarding life and death.

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,640
You knew it was dangerous

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,240
yet you still put yourself at risk.

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,079
How many lives do you think you have?

41
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Whether others live or die

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,800
means nothing to me.

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
I only want you to live.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
Your life

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,440
is my life.

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
If you die,

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,600
what meaning would all this have for me?

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
Even if I die,

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,040
I'll become a vengeful ghost

50
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
to fight you for the family fortune.

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't worry,

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,240
we'll see each other again then.

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,159
If you die,

54
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,100
I won't spare you a glance.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
I'll grind your bones to dust

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
and throw them in the river to feed the fish.

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,400
I, Huo Ran, always keep my word.

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
So,

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,250
you absolutely cannot die.

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
Let me handle this matter.

61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
Huo Ran.

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,210
The Huo family can't do without you after all.

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
So it's you.

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,240
What?

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,640
I've disappointed you.

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,200
You should enjoy some good food.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,490
You old bastard.

68
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,159
You don't have much time left.

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,810
They say a barking dog never bites.

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
It seems

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
that's indeed true.

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Tang Jing.

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,980
I suggest you see things clearly.

74
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,100
Whether this is a wolf or a dog.

75
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,760
You ungrateful bastard.

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,810
I should never have fed you in the first place.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
You say I'm ungrateful?

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,760
What kindness?

79
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
What loyalty?

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,280
I'm afraid

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,800
the only ungrateful person here

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
is you.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,880
I actually guessed you wouldn't kill me.

84
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,140
Are you mocking me?

85
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
I don't know either.

86
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,100
Perhaps I just want you to forgive me.

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
In this world,

88
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,000
I've only hated two people.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,400
One is my mother.

90
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,560
And you.

91
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,960
Huo Ran.

92
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,640
Do you hate me?

93
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,080
I've hated many people,

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
but never you.

95
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Let's try again.

96
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
It's raining today.

97
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,080
The day won't break.

98
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,880
Then tomorrow.

99
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,440
The day after.

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
Or the day after that.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
The sun will come out someday.

102
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Let's try again.

103
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,770
Live until dawn with me.

104
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
Mm.

105
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,960
That thing you mentioned before,

106
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,560
I'll definitely make it happen.

107
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,520
Boss.

108
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,840
Miss Huo has sent something.

109
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,080
No need to wait anymore.

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Director Tang won't be coming back.

111
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,920
But there's no need to worry.

112
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
As long as you're willing,

113
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
there will always be a place for you in the Long Hu Gang.

114
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Think it over carefully.

115
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,840
I'd like to see who dares.

116
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,370
Making such a big scene,

117
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,020
aren't you afraid of attracting the police?

118
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
Are you referring to them?

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,440
Director Tang,

120
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,920
this is all a misunderstanding,

121
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
a misunderstanding.

122
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,920
Since this is your family business,

123
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
we'll be leaving now.

124
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,600
We won't get involved.

125
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,440
Let's go,

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
hurry.

127
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,900
You can't be naive enough to think

128
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,490
that I would put all my chips

129
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,410
on a single deputy, can you?

130
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,320
Liyan,

131
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,940
I've told you long ago.

132
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,940
No matter how capable you are,

133
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
you still have my blood flowing in your veins.

134
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
This is your last chance.

135
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,240
Admit your mistakes and all will be forgiven.

136
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,640
Otherwise, you'll face the consequences.

137
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,680
Wen Liyan.

138
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,160
As long as this position exists,

139
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,560
Yun City belongs to me, Tang Jing.

140
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,400
Oh, really?

141
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Is that so?

142
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,840
What if you've already been dismissed,

143
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
Director Tang?

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,320
Absurd!

145
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,800
If I'm not the director, then who is?

146
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,200
New telegram from the provincial government.

147
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
Tang Jing, due to misconduct,

148
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,600
accepting bribes, and disregarding the law,

149
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,130
is hereby removed from the position of Director of Yun City Commerce Department,

150
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,760
effective immediately.

151
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
Sir,

152
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,940
as soon as Tang Jingyi went in,

153
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,080
their attitudes completely changed.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,280
All our orders are canceled.

155
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,840
I've wasted so much money on him.

156
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
I've been working like a slave, walking on eggshells.

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,480
Now it's all gone down the drain.

158
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
That damned bastard!

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,580
Father, please calm down.

160
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,100
We can negotiate new business deals.

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
But if we're labeled as troublemakers,

162
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,600
it will be hard to recover from that.

163
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,840
Fine.

164
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
Let's see how this plays out.

165
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,280
We'll see

166
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,960
who wins and who loses in the end.

167
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,640
Young Master Wen,

168
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,560
I was blind

169
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
to be deceived by him for so long.

170
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
I beg you, please save my daughter.

171
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,100
Take this boat ticket.

172
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,440
I've contacted

173
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,760
the best doctors abroad for you.

174
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,960
Take your daughter overseas first thing tomorrow morning.

175
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,400
Thank you, young master.

176
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,680
Thank you so much.

177
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
Lieutenant Li.

178
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,480
He's been through thick and thin with you,

179
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,080
never leaving your side.

180
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,800
He helps you build connections

181
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,040
and greases all the right wheels.

182
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,530
People treat you like a living Buddha.

183
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,080
And why is that?

184
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,240
Because you treat that man's daughter's leg condition

185
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
and never stop providing medicine.

186
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
But little does he know

187
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
that you're the one who had someone cripple his daughter.

188
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,840
So what if I did?

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,800
Training a dog requires a stick.

190
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,200
Aren't you afraid this will be exposed?

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,960
Go ahead.

192
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,840
Let's see.

193
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,970
Who will he believe?

194
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,960
You or me?

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
Besides,

196
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,690
even if he finds out, what can he do?

197
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,650
It's been so many years.

198
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
Can that girl survive without my medicine?

199
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,920
Liyan,

200
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,560
remember this.

201
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
No matter how capable you are,

202
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
you still have my blood running through your veins.

203
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,160
Besides,

204
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
aren't we partners?

205
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,840
Partners should

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
be completely open and honest with each other.

207
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
Hmm.

208
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,170
Then I'd like to ask you for another favor.

209
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,640
Sure.

210
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,380
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

211
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,380
Whatever it is,

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,680
that's my answer.

213
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,720
Okay.

214
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
I want you to help me arrange a meeting with Huo Ran.

215
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,680
If I ask her myself,

216
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,040
she definitely won't want to see me.

217
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Hmm.
