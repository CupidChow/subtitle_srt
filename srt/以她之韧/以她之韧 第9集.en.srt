1
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
Boss.

2
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,920
You clearly have special feelings for the second miss.

3
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,720
You even tolerate her cheating.

4
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,800
I suspect you might have fallen for her.

5
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
I want the goods.

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,040
She wants the person.

7
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
We each get what we want,

8
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,000
why not?

9
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
Come on!

10
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,460
Place your bets! No changes once placed!

11
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
Big!

12
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,920
One, one, two, small.

13
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
I won!

14
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,080
That's not possible.

15
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Impossible!

16
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
Again!

17
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,280
Young Master Huo.

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,920
Why don't you pay back your debts first?

19
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,040
Who are you?

20
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Hey!

21
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,610
You're the young master of the Huo family.

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,880
I'm a merchant from the South Seas.

23
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,600
I've just arrived here,

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,920
Young Master Huo, only you can help me.

25
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
Fine, I'll stay.

26
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Song Jiayu,

27
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
are you always this obedient?

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,240
You catch on quickly.

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,080
Here you go.

30
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,540
What exactly are you trying to do?

31
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,320
I want to sabotage this deal.

32
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,880
Make Huo Zhijie pay for it.

33
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,460
Make him pay the price.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,460
Let's make a bet, shall we?

35
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,680
If I win against you once,

36
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,240
will you help me?

37
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,800
What if you lose?

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,680
I'll do whatever you say.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Why should I bet with you?

40
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,000
You don't dare?

41
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,580
Then it's settled.

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
Song Jiayu.

43
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,440
Do you really think you can beat me this way?

44
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,140
Trying to win over Director Tang.

45
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,800
You've really overestimated yourself.

46
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
If I don't try,

47
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,560
how would I know?

48
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,360
Huo Ran.

49
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,440
What exactly is that thing hanging around your neck?

50
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,120
When you hit the wall

51
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,320
and crash badly,

52
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,400
it'll be too late for regrets.

53
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,260
Isn't that exactly what you want?

54
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,080
That's right.

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm waiting for you to mess up,

56
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,440
so I can personally throw you out of the Huo family.

57
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,640
There are some things

58
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,650
you should never touch.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
Is that so?

60
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,720
You...

61
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,360
Sister.

62
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,240
Why don't you kill me?

63
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,040
I truly regret not making my move earlier.

64
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
Take care of yourself.

65
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
Tell me. Where is the person?

66
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Miss,

67
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,600
there's no such thing as free information in this world.

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Hmm.

69
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,200
Well, these...

70
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,340
Either talk or die.

71
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,610
Miss, I'm sorry!

72
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
Miss, this money...

73
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
I don't want this money anymore.

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,520
I'll give it back to you.

75
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,320
No need. Keep it for your coffin.

76
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,520
Brother-in-law, thanks for letting me win.

77
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,450
This round goes to the Second Miss.

78
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
I lost.

79
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
This round goes to Young Master Wen.

80
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
Young master! Something terrible has happened!

81
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,320
That payment hasn't come through yet.

82
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,840
Why are you panicking?

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,840
Money first, then goods.

84
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,400
If he doesn't pay,

85
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,080
he won't get the goods.

86
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,320
Young master!

87
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
The goods!

88
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,840
What about the goods?

89
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,280
The shipment is gone.

90
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,600
You fool!

91
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,480
Stop hitting him!

92
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
Master!

93
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,440
We lost the goods.

94
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Master.

95
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
And the money is gone too.

96
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,080
Are you trying to ruin the Huo family?

97
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,680
Master!

98
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,520
Guards!

99
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Take this unfilial son and ship him to Southeast Asia.

100
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,320
Without my order,

101
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,800
he is never allowed to return.

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Father, I was wrong!

103
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
Please forgive me, Father!

104
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,220
Have mercy!

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
You can't do this! Please don't!

106
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,840
Zhijie!

107
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,960
Huo Ran!

108
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,330
Where is Huo Ran?

109
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,840
Master, the eldest miss isn't home,

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,240
but the second miss has returned.

111
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,400
Hurry, go!

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,320
Zhijie!

113
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,640
Father.

114
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,040
I can resolve this matter.

115
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,920
However,

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
sister must agree to one condition.

117
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,000
What condition?

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
I'll take full responsibility for this.

119
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Sister cannot interfere.

120
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
Don't even think about it.

121
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,120
You're the one who shouldn't interfere.

122
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,360
Father,

123
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
Iâ€”

124
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
Enough!

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,020
I gave you your chance.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,720
Father, please listen to me.

127
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
This matter will be handled by Jiayu.

128
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
It's a good opportunity for her to gain experience.

129
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
You should get some rest now that you're back.

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Your health comes first.

131
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
Yes, Father.

132
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,880
The last card.

133
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,480
You go first.

134
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,560
Boss, the Huo family's eldest daughter is looking for someone everywhere.

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,160
It seems you only see hatred.

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Or perhaps, this sister of yours.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,530
Don't you only see profit in your eyes too?

138
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,160
You're right.

139
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,880
I only see profit.

140
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,140
Shall we continue?

141
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,520
It's not over yet.

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,330
The winner is still undecided.

143
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,520
I won.

144
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,440
The second miss wins this round.

145
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,840
You cheated.

146
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,640
Rules weren't set. Everything is fair game.

147
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,840
You...

148
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,260
A loss is a loss.

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Your conditions. I accept them.

150
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,480
Thank you, brother-in-law.

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,040
Miss, the shipment has been handled properly.

152
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,720
Everything is ready.

153
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,920
I'll inform the boss about this matter.

154
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,050
The Commerce Department uniform.

155
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,280
So what if I lost money?

156
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,840
I just took a loss.

157
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,840
But I'll make it back right away.

158
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
Mom, you know what?

159
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,640
Hmm?

160
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,770
That clueless guy from Southeast Asia

161
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,900
paid double the price.

162
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
Double!

163
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,720
You truly are my good son.

164
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,920
Your father doesn't know how capable his son is.
