1
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,200
Miss

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
Please don't force yourself.

3
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
Earlier

4
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
my father read my fortune.

5
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
He said

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Director Tang and I are destined for each other.

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
To have such a husband

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
is my good fortune.

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,360
I am willing to marry him.

10
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,240
However,

11
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,920
I have a small request.

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,039
Oh?

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,840
I was wondering

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,050
if we could delay for a few days.

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,080
Until I recover completely.

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,650
Otherwise it would spoil the wedding joy.

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,320
That would be unforgivable.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,800
Of course.

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,210
I will find the best doctor for you.

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,120
The person Director Tang wanted

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,200
has been found.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,240
Sir,

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,200
how did it go?

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,300
The second young lady has been found.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
However,

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,079
Director Tang sent his own people.

27
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,000
What?

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,260
Director Tang says...

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Says what?

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,890
Tell me quickly.

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,140
Director Tang says you're incompetent,

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,820
and the export permits he promised to the Huo family

33
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
are all canceled.

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,890
This is outrageous!

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Sir,

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
please calm down.

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,890
Director Tang is the governor's favorite right now.

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
In a few days,

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,080
the governor will come to Yun City for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Offending him at this time

41
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,320
would have unimaginable consequences.

42
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,450
After the ceremony,

43
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,839
your second daughter's wedding day will be approaching.

44
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,370
By then, you and Director Tang will be family,

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,720
and there might still be a chance for things to turn around.

46
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,050
That bastard Tang Jing.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
The Second Miss seems to be having quite a good time.

48
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
You young people are really something.

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
I must say,

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,480
this cat and mouse game

51
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,490
is quite entertaining.

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
If the Second Miss enjoys it so much,

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,159
and wants to play for a few more years,

54
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,120
I wonder how many lives others have to spare.

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Let me count,

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
dozens of people in the Huo family,

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,360
plus the Dragon Tiger Gang.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Director Tang,

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,420
I, Jiayu, was being willful earlier.

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
Please be understanding, Director Tang.

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,240
I'm afraid someone might tamper with your medicine.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll get it myself.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,460
The Dragon Tiger Gang brothers are all here.

64
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,080
I'll be back soon.

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,640
Miss,

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
I finally found you.

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,120
The doctor says your test results are ready.

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,440
Come with me.

69
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,840
Come.

70
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Where's the doctor?

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,920
Where is everyone?

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,680
Where did they go?

73
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
What are you standing there for?

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Search!

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,840
Yes.

76
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,760
Boss.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
This...

78
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,120
But judging by your complexion,

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,680
it doesn't seem like an ordinary cold.

80
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,560
What's wrong?

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,280
Did someone hurt you at the Huo family?

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,120
Jiayu.

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't be afraid. Tell me.

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll definitely get revenge for you.

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Let me guess.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Could it be

87
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Huo Ran?

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,760
It's not her.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
You're overthinking.

90
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,400
Is that so?

91
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,600
That's good if nothing happened.

92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
Then you should get some rest.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,080
On your wedding day,

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,140
I'll make sure you become the most beautiful bride in Yun City.

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Boss.

96
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,280
Taking the second miss to the hospital tomorrow

97
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,610
has been arranged properly. Don't worry.

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,280
Boss.

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,760
Since the second miss has remembered everything,

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
why don't you take this chance to express your feelings to her?

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,560
Duan Ming.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Is there really nothing

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,480
but romance in your head?

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,260
But if a man and woman want to protect each other,

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,880
what else can they be

106
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,840
besides becoming partners?

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,880
Companions.

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,280
Companions.

109
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
Being companions

110
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,820
might last longer.

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Yes.

112
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,000
Most importantly,

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
she has

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
seen through me all along.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,760
Miss, I've found out

116
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,680
Tang Jing has been staying indoors these days,

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,810
seemingly on guard.

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,159
But the governor will attend the Yuncheng railway opening ceremony.

119
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,400
Tang Jing is in charge of this event,

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,060
so he will definitely show up.

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,640
How many days until then?

122
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Three days.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,320
Good.

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,240
Three days from now

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,320
will be the day he dies.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Do you need us to prepare anything?

127
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
No need.

128
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,760
I'll go alone.

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Miss,

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,960
you mustn't put yourself in danger

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,320
and risk your life.

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,880
This is my personal vendetta.

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,610
Others shouldn't be involved.

134
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
If anything happens to me,

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,040
divide these among yourselves.

136
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,400
These things

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
will be enough for you to secure your positions in the Huo family.

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
Miss!

139
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Say no more.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
My mind is made up.

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
Miss,

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
if you don't take me with you,

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,320
you might as well kill me now.

144
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Ayue!

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
Miss!

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,299
We're willing to follow you to death.

147
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,240
Didn't the plan succeed?

148
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,280
What happened to your face?

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,680
Go. Hurry up.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
So this was planned between you and Song Jiayu.

151
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,760
She deliberately let Tang Jing capture her

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
just to infiltrate the Tang mansion

153
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
and plant evidence to frame him.

154
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,120
Yes.

155
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Wen Liyan,

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,610
how dare you put her in such danger!

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,480
You know perfectly well what a den of wolves the Tang mansion is,

158
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280
yet you still let her go.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,060
Why do you have so little faith in her?

160
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,000
That's not the point.

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,250
No, it is exactly the point.

162
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
Huo Ran,

163
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,560
you know better than anyone

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,860
that she's an eagle in the sky,

165
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
not a bird in your hand.

166
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Besides,

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,720
from the moment you entered the Huo family and exchanged identities with her,

168
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,880
it was destined

169
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,960
that she would forever live in the storm.

170
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
That's just how it is.

171
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,840
She actually decided to give up everything

172
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,520
and risk it all to assassinate Tang Jing.

173
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,960
Thank you.

174
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,960
Why are you telling me all this?

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,960
Mind your own business.

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,960
That's not like you.

177
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,880
I just don't want you to have any regrets.

178
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,160
Let's go.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,760
Go.

180
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,210
That's impossible.

181
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,920
Doctor,

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
please be honest with me.

183
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,280
How serious is the poison in my body?

184
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,340
How can it be cured?

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,640
Strange, miss.

186
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,520
Your pulse is strong.

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
You haven't been poisoned at all.

188
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,520
What?

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,850
That's impossible.

190
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,080
I was clearly vomiting blood before.

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,280
My whole body was in severe pain.

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
How could this be?

193
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,520
That's impossible.

194
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,440
But...

195
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,480
Miss,

196
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,280
have you suffered from an eye condition before?

197
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,400
It must have been sudden,

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,690
caused by an impact.

199
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
The symptoms were severe,

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,280
even causing darkness in vision and difficulty seeing.

201
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,440
That's it then.

202
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,370
Your eye condition,

203
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
though seemingly cured,

204
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,120
has actually left underlying issues.

205
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,480
The cold energy in your body hasn't dispersed, blocking your blood flow.

206
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,400
If this continues, it will certainly cause permanent damage.

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Miss,

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,730
what seemed like poison

209
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,280
was actually medicine.

210
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,000
It contains Ligusticum, Notoginseng, and Safflower,

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,760
all of which help expel the stagnant blood from your body

212
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,400
and eliminate the cold dampness inside you.

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
These symptoms will disappear within three to five days.

214
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,080
You needn't worry.

215
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,160
The person who gave you this medicine

216
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,400
wasn't trying to harm you,

217
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
but to save you.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Congratulations.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
Later,

220
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,980
the governor will take time out of his busy schedule

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,840
to attend our Yuncheng railway opening ceremony.

222
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Everyone,

223
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
please be on your best behavior.

224
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,160
Yes, of course.

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,240
Wen Liyan.

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,720
You really are Tang Jing's loyal dog.

227
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,600
I want him dead

228
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
more than anyone else in this world.

229
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Why should I believe you?

230
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
Because I made a promise to Song Jiayu.

231
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,600
I never break my word.

232
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,480
Huo Ran.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
We're on the same side.

234
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,560
Then you shouldn't stop me.

235
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,640
If we let that beast Tang Jing

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,520
die just like that,

237
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,780
wouldn't that be too easy for him?

238
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,320
Talk.

239
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,160
Was it your Huo family?

240
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,770
I don't know.

241
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,400
That old fox Huo Tingshan

242
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,460
ruined the ribbon-cutting ceremony

243
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,240
and made me lose face in front of the governor.

244
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,840
Father.

245
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
How could he possibly...

246
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,680
He showed no mercy, so don't blame me for being ruthless.

247
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,740
You'll be my bride in the underworld.

248
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,360
A ghost marriage is still a marriage, isn't it?

249
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,480
If you must blame someone,

250
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,320
blame your father who couldn't recognize an opportunity.

251
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,980
Trouble! The police are here!

252
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
What?

253
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,760
Tang Jing.

254
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,280
You're suspected of attempting to assassinate the governor.

255
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,400
Come with me.

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,440
Nonsense!

257
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,400
What evidence do you have?

258
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,040
This gun model

259
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,880
is identical to the one used in the assassination attempt.

260
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
No!

261
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
Impossible!

262
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,770
If you have anything to say,

263
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,360
you can tell us at the police station.
