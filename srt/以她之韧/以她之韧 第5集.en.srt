1
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm truly impressed.

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
Reporter Deng,

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
I don't deserve such praise.

4
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,400
In this world,

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,080
no one wants to share what they love.

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,520
I, Huo Ran, am no exception.

7
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
You're lying!

8
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
You're lying!

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
With such poor judgment, how did you become a reporter?

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,160
Miss Huo,

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,960
could the person in the photo be you?

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,039
Everyone,

13
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,759
the answer you're looking for is right here.

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,820
Miss Huo, will you forgive Wen Liyan?

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,920
Does Mr. Huo know about this?

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
Will the marriage alliance between the Huo and Wen families be canceled?

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Miss Huo!

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,160
Miss Huo! Miss Huo!

19
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,400
Open the door, Miss Huo!

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,160
Miss Huo, please give us a response!

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,280
Miss Huo! Miss Huo!

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Say something!

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,640
Miss Huo, will you forgive Wen Liyan?

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,160
That's right!

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,600
Will the marriage alliance between the Huo and Wen families be canceled?

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,479
Miss Huo, open the door!

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,960
Miss Huo!

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,440
I must disappoint you all.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
Our engagement ceremony

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,960
will proceed as scheduled.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,600
As scheduled?

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Miss Huo certainly knows how to swallow her pride.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,160
In my opinion, the Huo family caravan flags

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
from now on

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,840
should be painted green.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,560
What do you all think?

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,200
Good!

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Miss Huo, seeing is believing.

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,890
Your tolerance is truly beyond what ordinary people could manage.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,260
Are you satisfied with this show?

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
Sister.

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,980
I have no idea what you're talking about.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
Sister.

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
Lying isn't a good habit.

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,680
You're crazy.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Of course I'm satisfied.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
Sister has such impressive skills.

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
I V

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,440
I

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,640
can't compare to you.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's wait and see.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
Miss, what an impressive performance.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,090
If you knew how to behave properly,

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,560
you could avoid a lot of trouble.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,840
Three percent interest.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,370
This price is out of respect for your boss Wen.

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,820
It's a fair deal, isn't it?

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,770
We'll settle accounts, of course.

60
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,560
But the one who should be offering discounts isn't me.

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
It should be you,

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,360
Miss Huo.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,480
This one is wrong.

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,360
That one doesn't look right either.

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,680
What should we do?

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,079
Does Mr. Huo know about this?

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,620
Will the marriage alliance between the Huo and Wen families be canceled?

68
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
It's too late.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Miss.

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
Businessmen never make deals that lose money.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
You have to be willing to use bait

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
to catch the big fish.

73
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,290
Who's really the crazy one?

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
Sister.

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
We are sisters.

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:25,880
We should have the same blood flowing in our veins.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,480
I will investigate this matter thoroughly.

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
No matter who that person is,

79
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,000
I will make her pay the price.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Reporter Deng.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
Expect a letter from my lawyer.

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,480
Since ancient times,

83
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,560
when men are promiscuous, it's called romance,

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,159
worthy of poetry and praise,

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,460
remembered for generations.

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,280
But if it's a woman,

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,700
she's considered unforgivable,

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,960
her name forever disgraced.

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
But with me, Huo Ran,

90
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,370
such rules don't exist.

91
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,480
Good.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,640
It's really her.

93
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,560
So it's Miss Huo.

94
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,500
It's a misunderstanding.

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,440
Come.

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
A private bedroom matter

97
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,360
is a personal affair.

98
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
We have everyone here.

99
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,440
I've disturbed you all

100
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,290
and offer this small token of apology.

101
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,800
All reporters are here.

102
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
You're too kind.

103
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,080
It's all

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,080
just a misunderstanding.

105
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,090
Such an indecent thing.

106
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,660
What are you doing?

107
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
Sir.

108
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm begging you.

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,680
Wanrou.

110
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,940
This is your own daughter.

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,680
Wanrou.

112
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,240
She is our daughter.

113
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't want to part with her either.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,880
But what can we do when she was born with such good fortune?

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,280
Trust me.

116
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,360
Just this once.

117
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
That man said

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,060
if we help change his luck,

119
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,640
his business will succeed.

120
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
From now on,

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
our Huo family will have a powerful backer.

122
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Then you can give birth to another daughter for me.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,880
No, wait.

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,540
Have a son instead,

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
to continue our Huo family line.

126
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,880
Even tigers don't eat their cubs.

127
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Huo Tingshan,

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,840
you are utterly shameless.

129
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,800
Favoring boys over girls,

130
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,480
selling your daughter for your own gain!

131
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,760
Women's foolish thinking.

132
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,680
You don't have the authority to make decisions for the Huo family.

133
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,540
Hey, come here.

134
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,640
Come here.

135
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,280
Try one.

136
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
It's fine.

137
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Madam.

138
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,160
This child was born on the same day as our young lady.

139
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,690
She also has the rare Vermilion Bird destiny.

140
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,440
I've made inquiries.

141
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,120
She has no parents.

142
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,050
She's an orphan.

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,320
If we want to switch the children,

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,960
she would be the perfect candidate.

145
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
No matter what,

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,240
I don't have the heart

147
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,920
to sacrifice that child as a scapegoat.

148
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,760
I just don't know

149
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
if escaping from that cruel household

150
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,400
was the right decision.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,420
Why don't you ask your dear sister

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
what she did to me?

153
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
Please.

154
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,480
Song Jiayu.

155
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,560
This time I'll make sure you remember me.

156
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,960
Five percent interest. Deal.

157
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,280
I'm surprised.

158
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,760
Miss Huo, you really are a good sister.

159
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,440
But you must know how the Dragon Tiger Gang operates.

160
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,840
I thought you'd thank me.

161
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,360
For eliminating your biggest problem.

162
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
My affairs with her

163
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,680
are none of an outsider's business.

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,640
Don't forget.

165
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,760
We're just business partners.

166
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,240
Each taking what we need.

167
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,080
Seven percent interest.

168
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,400
I'll think about it.

169
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,800
Mom will send you away soon.

170
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
Just wait.

171
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,560
Get out.

172
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Leave me alone.

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
Mom! Mom!

174
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,560
Mom, save me!

175
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,520
Mom!

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,120
Jiayu!

177
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,560
Mom, help me!

178
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,280
Jiayu!

179
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
Mom!

180
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
Mom, save me!

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Jiayu!

182
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
Huo Ran!

183
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Mom, help me!

184
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,400
Jiayu! Jiayu!

185
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,440
Miss.

186
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,680
Master wants to see you in his study.

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Coming.

188
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,840
Father.

189
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Do you know what you did wrong?

190
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
Playing dumb?

191
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Father, please speak your mind.

192
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,960
In this matter,

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,840
you cut your losses.

194
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,040
You preserved our relationship with the Dragon Tiger Gang. That deserves praise.

195
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,900
But this situation should never have happened in the first place.

196
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,410
As a daughter of the Huo family,

197
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,220
you can't even control your own husband.

198
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,680
Disgraceful!

199
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,840
This is your punishment.

200
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,200
Remember,

201
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
it's because of me

202
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,570
that you became part of the Huo family.

203
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,360
Always obey your father.
