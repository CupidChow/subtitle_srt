1
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,720
This necklace was left by your mother.

2
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,650
It's perfect as your wedding gift.

3
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
We rise together, we fall together.

4
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,000
This

5
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,760
is what being a family means.

6
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
Huo Ran.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,770
Don't you agree?

8
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,720
Yes,

9
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,960
I understand, Father.

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
That's right.

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,640
Come,

12
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,800
let me put it on for you.

13
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,720
Where is Huo Ran?

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,580
The young mistress is in the ancestral hall.

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,039
So...

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,320
You went to all this trouble

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,280
just to frame my sister?

18
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,320
Ghost!

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,520
You think Huo Tingshan doesn't understand?

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
In this family, there's no distinction between good and evil,

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,540
only one type of person gets eliminated:

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,440
the useless ones.

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,480
Ghost!

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,920
You!

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,520
And you!

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,480
You're all ghosts!

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
No wonder I can't win against you.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,079
I should have known.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,930
You're all daughters of evil spirits.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,240
Hurry up!

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Be more efficient.

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,880
Yes.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Why are you so slow?

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Speed up. Honestly.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,960
You're being so sluggish.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,960
You.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,520
Auntie, it's been a while.

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
You're so angry the moment you step out.

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
You country bumpkin.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,970
Your smugness won't last long.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,890
My son Zhijie will be back soon.

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,020
He's the only male heir of the Huo family.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,180
If you cross me,

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
you'll see what happens.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
Once Huo Ran is married off,

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
let's see who in this family will stand up for you.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
Sister.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
What should I do?

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm so scared.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
A married daughter is like spilled water.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,450
What are you looking at?

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,600
You won't have any say in the Huo family affairs in the future.

53
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,200
Fool.

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,520
The sun must be rising from the west today.

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,920
You're willing to come out.

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,280
Oh, Master.

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
Listen to what you're saying.

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,640
Our family has a joyous occasion.

59
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,600
As a concubine, I should certainly do my part.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,640
Help with the preparations.

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,880
Master, you see.

62
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
With the young miss getting married,

63
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,360
her brother should come back.

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
To give a gift, that's only right.

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,200
After all, the young miss has taken good care of Zhijie.

66
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,680
Zhijie should return the favor.

67
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
Besides, you've just taken office.

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Having the whole family together

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,560
will surely give the people of Yun City

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,960
a good impression.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,360
There's some truth to what you say.

72
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,080
So perhaps we should...

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,860
There's no need for him to return.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,680
I appreciate my brother's sentiment.

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,200
But his future is more important right now.

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Affairs in Nanyang are busy.

77
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,200
Why waste time and effort making a special trip?

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,240
Father,

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,970
don't you agree?

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,659
You're always so thoughtful.

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,200
Master,

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,920
Master, you...

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
We'll discuss his return later.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,960
I have work to do. I'll go first.

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,720
Master.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,860
No one can predict the future,

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,880
but for now, you have no right to meddle in the Huo family affairs.

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,960
You.

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Jiayu.

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,560
It's all just coincidence

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,130
and circumstances making heroes.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
Without your sister's help,

93
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
this position of mine

94
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
would probably be unstable.

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
Father, you're too modest.

96
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,240
Before,

97
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,560
things were chaotic and in turmoil.

98
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,680
Now things have finally settled down.

99
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
When Liyan returns,

100
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,920
your marriage will need to be scheduled.

101
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,880
The Huo family has two daughters.

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,960
One just escaped from hell,

103
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,520
and the other can't wait to jump in.

104
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,560
Father,

105
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,000
you have such grand schemes.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
A father knows his daughter best.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
Huo Ran,

108
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,920
I understand

109
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
your temperament very well.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,760
How could I possibly let you suffer?

111
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,080
Once you become the gang leader's wife,

112
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
if one day there's no leader,

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,820
won't the Dragon Tiger Gang be yours for the taking?

114
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,880
What you earn through your own abilities

115
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
will always be yours.

116
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,560
He actually wants to use Huo Ran

117
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,690
to eliminate Wen Liyan.

118
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
Father is truly generous.

119
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,920
This is nothing.

120
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,480
In the future,

121
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,520
won't the Huo family belong to all of you?

122
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Zhijie is such a disappointment.

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,760
Fortunately, you sisters are united,

124
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
giving the Huo family some hope.

125
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,440
With the wedding date approaching,

126
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,300
you must take care of your health.

127
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't forget to take your medicine.

128
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Thank you, Father.

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,360
Just as I expected.

130
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Tell me,

131
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,140
why does Huo Tingshan want to go after Wen Liyan?

132
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,460
Tang Jing was able to control Yun City

133
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,880
because he had influence in both legal and criminal circles.

134
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,010
The Dragon Tiger Gang was previously under his control.

135
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
After Tang Jing's downfall,

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Wen Liyan acted quickly.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,660
In just a few days, he took over all his subordinates

138
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,680
and brought them into the Dragon Tiger Gang.

139
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,360
So that means

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,240
the Dragon Tiger Gang is now the dominant force in Yun City.

141
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,360
That's right.

142
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,760
Huo Tingshan went to great lengths to bribe officials,

143
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,690
secured government connections,

144
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,520
and obtained a ministerial position.

145
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
But

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,920
government officials can't control the underworld.

147
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,380
If the Dragon Tiger Gang can't be used by him,

148
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
they'll become a serious threat.

149
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,340
And he knows Wen Liyan will never submit.

150
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,480
That's why he wants me to get married quickly.

151
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,080
As long as Wen Liyan dies,

152
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
the Dragon Tiger Gang will belong to the Huo family.

153
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,970
Unfortunately, that day will never come.

154
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,640
Let's be patient for now.

155
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Don't act rashly.

156
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,680
Mm-hmm.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,640
Does it still hurt?

158
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,000
The one who's really in pain

159
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,920
is clearly you.

160
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,720
Alright.

161
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,320
It's getting late.

162
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,780
We can discuss important matters tomorrow.

163
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
You should rest now.

164
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,160
You've had a long day.

165
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720
You should have rested earlier.

166
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
You know, we were born on the same day of the same month.

167
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,730
It might not be bad if I were the older sister instead.

168
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
So disrespectful.

169
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
Go to sleep.

170
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
Huo Ran.

171
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,940
I was careless and bumped into you, Second Miss.

172
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
Please be magnanimous and forgive my offense.

173
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,560
Please don't hold it against me.

174
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
I made this white fungus soup myself.

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,730
Please accept it as my apology.

176
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
I cannot accept such a generous gift from you.

177
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,780
Second Miss, I beg you.

178
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
Please put in a good word for me with the First Miss.

179
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
I'm begging you.

180
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,170
If you won't forgive me,

181
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,000
I won't leave.

182
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,090
I'll stay right here

183
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
and kowtow to you for a day and night.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,920
Enough.

185
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,800
I can't help you.

186
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,520
Please leave now.

187
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,160
Second Miss, please take pity on me.

188
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
Please have mercy on me.

189
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,200
Second Miss.

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Second Miss.

191
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,340
Please take pity on me.

192
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,040
Second Miss.

193
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,280
Second Miss.

194
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,000
Second Miss.

195
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
Second Miss.

196
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,840
Hmph.

197
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Yes.

198
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
That's right.

199
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,160
Jiang Wanrou.

200
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,720
You're dead but you're still trying to destroy me.

201
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
You'll get what you deserve.

202
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,640
Your daughter is just like you.

203
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,560
She'll meet a terrible end too.

204
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,370
What do you mean by that?

205
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,360
Why don't you ask your fiancé?

206
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,240
Guess if the Dragon Tiger Gang killed her.

207
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,980
For Jiang Wanrou's death,

208
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,120
I bear responsibility.
