1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,320
You know better than I do.

2
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,720
She's not like us.

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
Let's end it here.

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
Jiayu.

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,560
About last time,

6
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,200
I haven't had the chance to thank you properly.

7
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,560
Director Tang, you're too kind.

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,220
Director Tang, in the future,

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
we should keep in touch more often.

10
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,440
Yes, of course.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,160
We'll need your support for many business matters in the future.

12
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,400
Hmm.

13
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,400
There will be many more opportunities ahead.

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,520
Jiayu.

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,500
Guards! Catch him!

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Are you okay?

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,479
Murder! Murder!

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,320
Help!

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
Catch him!

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,720
Let's go!

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,079
I'll handle this.

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,760
What's going on?

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
How could he accidentally hurt the Second Miss?

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
Song Jiayu did it on purpose.

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,920
Why?

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Sister.

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,680
You've been tricked.

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,530
So it was you all along, Sister.

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,640
I don't understand what you're talking about.

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,579
You're still pretending.

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,060
I almost believed you.

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,800
Song Jiayu.

33
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,620
You're quite capable.

34
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,810
Even willing to risk your own life.

35
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,840
Who told you to be so clever?

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Sister.

37
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
Why did you hide it from me?

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,930
Something terrible has happened!

39
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,560
Director Tang.

40
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,180
Director Tang says

41
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
he wants to marry the Second Miss.

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,640
What?

43
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
Hey!

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
Isn't that the second Miss Huo?

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,400
Why is she dancing with her sister's fiancé?

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,120
Shh.

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
Are you tired of living?

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,520
Haven't you seen the look on the eldest Miss's face?

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,480
Wen Liyan.

50
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,040
Stay away from Song Jiayu.

51
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
She couldn't have done it alone.

52
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,640
It's impossible that she stole Huo Zhijie's goods

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,440
and got away clean after dealing with Tang Jing.

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
You've been helping her

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,450
all this time, haven't you?

56
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,480
Miss Huo.

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,060
In what capacity are you questioning me?

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,920
The eldest daughter of the Huo family?

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
My fiancée?

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,080
Or perhaps

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,600
the caring big sister worried about her sibling?

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
Giving up?

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
Never.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,330
Mr. Huo, you've raised your daughter so well.

65
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,530
You flatter me, Director Tang.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,130
Especially this Jiayu.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,640
Though she was lost for many years,

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,080
she has grown into such a graceful young lady.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,520
Truly more beautiful than the flowers.

70
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,680
No matter how beautiful the flower,

71
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
if no one picks it,

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,360
wouldn't that be a shame?

73
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Don't you agree, Director Tang?

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,520
No matter what dance steps,

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,050
as long as you take the lead,

76
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,980
you can dance till the end.

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
You forgot,

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
waltz is a dance for two.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,260
At least in this dance,

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
we're not enemies but partners.

81
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm leaving now.

82
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,760
Practice your dancing well.

83
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,820
What about outside of this dance?

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

85
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
at today's party,

86
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Director Tang has prepared a special surprise for everyone.

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,840
We're going to try something Western:

88
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
a masquerade ball.

89
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,260
Please find your dance partners.

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,010
You have three minutes.

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,450
Yes, it sounds quite interesting.

92
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,500
I've never been to one before.

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,840
Jiayu.

94
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,800
Alright, time's up.

95
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
What a coincidence, Director Tang.

96
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,780
You deliberately chose me to dance with.

97
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
What's your purpose?

98
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,880
Dancing with the leader of the Dragon Tiger Gang

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,610
isn't that every woman's wish?

100
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Then tell me,

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
why have you been staring

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,050
at your sister this whole time?

103
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
I understand now.

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,600
You want my fiancée

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,090
to be humiliated in public,

106
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,920
don't you?

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,960
So will you

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
help me?

109
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Is that Jiayu

110
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,280
next to Liyan?

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
Your wedding with Liyan

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
will be held soon.

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,720
There must be no mishaps.

114
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Father,

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,880
my sister is still young.

116
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,520
Having a little fun occasionally

117
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,400
is no big deal.

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,880
However,

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
you seem particularly concerned today.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,760
Could it be

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,380
that you have other plans for her?

122
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,940
You'll find out later.

123
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,360
You're late.

124
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,580
Father instructed you to practice dancing with me.

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
Is this your attitude?

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,840
Second Miss, I've been asking around.

127
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,520
Everyone in the Huo family knows

128
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,280
that the First Miss never touches Go

129
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,400
and absolutely detests it.

130
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,120
She's been punished for it.

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,090
But even after being beaten severely,

132
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
she still couldn't play.

133
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,010
Perhaps she truly has no talent for it.

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

135
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
What?

136
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,720
Do you want me to comfort you?

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
Song Jiayu.

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
You don't actually think that just because you called me sister a few times,

139
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
I've become your real sister, do you?

140
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,420
Kneel down.

141
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,800
Boss.

142
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,040
This man infiltrated

143
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,170
the craftsmen preparing for Director Tang's birthday banquet

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,330
with malicious intent.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,920
Let me go!

146
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,940
Back in the day,

147
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,920
the Dragon Tiger Gang was full of loyal men.

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,160
I never thought

149
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,760
you'd find yourself a new father

150
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,290
and become Tang Jing's lapdog.

151
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
So it was you

152
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,410
who wanted to assassinate Director Tang during the birthday banquet.

153
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
Tang Jing is a beast.

154
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,320
My daughter was so young.

155
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
He forcibly took her away

156
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,740
locked her in a room

157
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,320
and tortured her to death.

158
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
Wen Liyan.

159
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,880
Even if you kill me,

160
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll still take that beast down with me.

161
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
Even as a ghost,

162
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,210
I won't let any of you go.

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
Who said I want to kill you?

164
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm just

165
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
giving you a better opportunity

166
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,040
to kill him.
