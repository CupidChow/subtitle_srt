1
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,800
Mother.

2
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
Mother.

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Remember to escape when you get the chance.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
No, Mother.

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,580
I want to stay here with you

6
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,490
and help you find my sister.

7
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,120
If you find her...

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Don't.

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,440
Don't let her come back.

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,400
Don't let her return to the Huo family.

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,640
Do you understand?

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,800
Yes, Mother.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Guards!

14
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,640
Take her and sell her to the Paramount Club.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
Don't even think about it.

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,930
I'll send her away as soon as possible.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,039
You!

18
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't hit Aunt Jiang!

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,600
How dare you defy me!

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you trying to do?

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
Let go!

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
Let go!

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
I'll think about it.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,640
But

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,130
you're injured.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240
Don't let it get infected.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's treat it first.

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,380
No need to lie to me.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,930
This isn't for treating wounds, is it?

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Fine.

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,760
From today on,

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,400
you are the eldest daughter of my Huo family, Huo Ran.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,040
Zhijie.

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,200
The son of Anhua Bank's president

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,240
is your friend.

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
What is it, Dad?

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,720
Go and express my condolences on my behalf.

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
I'll go.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
The crime scene is near our home.

40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,040
It couldn't be someone from our family, could it?

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,360
Shut up.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,840
That's bad luck.

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,320
I'll go offer condolences right away.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,120
Sir.

45
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Sir.

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,900
The witness to last night's murder has identified the killer.

47
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,840
The killer...

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
Stop beating around the bush.

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
What about the killer?

50
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,600
She identified the second young lady as the murderer.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,720
The police station wants the second young lady to come in for questioning.

52
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
Jiang Wanrou.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
I never thought you'd be so bold.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,840
You made me miss the perfect opportunity.

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,400
Now even if we gave her away for free,

56
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,520
nobody would want her.

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,760
Master.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,720
Our child might be dead already.

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,320
At a time like this,

60
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,970
how can you still think about such things?

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,520
Yes,

62
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,920
she's dead.

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
My fortune died with her.

64
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,159
You ruined everything.

65
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,490
You're such an eyesore.

66
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,100
Bring her down.

67
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
Yes.

68
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,050
Song Jiayu, you've committed murder.

69
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
Jiayu.

70
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,040
Did you do this?

71
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
No.

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,290
I don't know who this person is,

73
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
or where this place is.

74
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
You're still denying it?

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,000
The killer has already identified you.

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
Mrs. Jiang.

77
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Mrs. Jiang.

78
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Take her away.

79
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,960
Keep me here.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
I can be useful to you.

81
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,960
What did you say?

82
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,159
You've seen it yourself.

83
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,290
I'm not afraid of anything.

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
As long as you stop bullying Mrs. Jiang.

85
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,360
I can definitely give you what you want.

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,600
I promise you.

87
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,600
Mother.

88
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
I've found my sister.

89
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,530
Don't worry.

90
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I'll definitely protect her.

91
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
I'll get her away from the hell of the Huo family.

92
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
Stay back!

93
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Run!

94
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,560
Don't come any closer!

95
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
Don't be afraid.

96
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
I need your help with something.

97
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
No!

98
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,600
Doctor, how is she?

99
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,090
The patient suffered a severe head injury

100
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,640
which may cause temporary blindness.

101
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,360
How long will it take to recover?

102
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,520
It could be two or three days,

103
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
or maybe a month,

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
or it depends on the patient herself.

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,640
Miss,

106
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,760
the master is asking about the second young lady.

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Go tell him

108
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
that Jiayu is still missing

109
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,520
and I'm doing my best to find her.

110
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,920
Yes.

111
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,160
Thankfully you were concerned

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,320
and went after the second young lady.

113
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,560
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

114
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
So please don't blame yourself.

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm fine.

116
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
For the next few days,

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
I'll stay here to take care of her.

118
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,460
When she recovers,

119
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,360
I'll personally escort her out.

120
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Dad.

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,680
If that's the case,

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,520
we must send Song Jiayu away.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
If we don't,

124
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,250
won't we all be implicated?

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,720
Our Huo family has always been responsible to others.

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,360
If we abandon our own daughter,

127
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
and word gets out,

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
who would work with us in the future?

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Huo Ran.

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,020
What you mean is...

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
There must be another culprit behind this.

132
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
During this period,

133
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,450
my sister shouldn't stay here.

134
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
I suggest we send her away to lie low for a while.

135
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
When the truth comes to light,

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,040
we can bring her back.

137
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
Good.

138
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,320
Let's do that.

139
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
Jiayu,

140
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

141
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,240
Yes,

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,460
I'll do as you say, Father.

143
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,720
Sister,

144
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
you've won this round beautifully.

145
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,800
I don't understand what you're talking about.

146
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,640
Don't worry,

147
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
I will come back.

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,120
Hmm.

149
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,760
Huo Ran.

150
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,600
This time you've delivered it right into my hands.

151
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,360
Once Song Jiayu is dead,

152
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,400
I'd like to see how you'll turn things around.

153
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,240
Sister.

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,720
You set this all up, didn't you?

155
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,320
But I won't go down so easily.

156
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,440
Liu Ma.

157
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,760
Yes?

158
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,160
Give me the ticket.

159
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
You can see me off here.

160
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,440
Miss.

161
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
The elder miss said

162
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,770
I must personally see you onto the train before I can return.

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,840
Kill!

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,700
Miss, run quickly!

165
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,840
Are you going to convict an innocent person

166
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,170
based solely on a stranger's accusation?

167
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,440
I think she did it.

168
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,160
Zhijie,

169
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,960
did you wake up with your brain not fully functioning?

170
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
Can't you see this is clearly a false accusation?

171
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Ran, you...

172
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Father.

173
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,480
This wound was fatal with a single strike.

174
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
Obviously the killer is a trained fighter.

175
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,640
I suspect

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,640
this person is specifically targeting our Huo family.

177
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,040
And they're using Jiayu.

178
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,840
Boss,

179
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,960
you asked me to keep an eye on the Huo family,

180
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,920
something's happened to the second Miss Huo.

181
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
Boss,

182
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,640
she's completely dead.

183
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,000
Looks like we're one step too late.

184
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,160
The second Miss has already been taken away.

185
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,320
Clean it up.

186
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,370
Don't leave anyone behind.

187
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Yes, sir.
