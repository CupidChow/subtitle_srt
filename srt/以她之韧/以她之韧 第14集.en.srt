1
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,720
I can tell you the reason.

2
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,920
Your mother helped me.

3
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,520
And you are her only concern.

4
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,479
Actually,

5
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,180
she never gave up looking for you.

6
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,160
Before she died, I promised her

7
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
to protect you.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,560
Is that all?

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
That's all.

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,080
I don't lie in front of my mother.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Burn the incense.

12
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,900
I just want to fulfill my promise.

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,440
Don't think too much.

14
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
You and I

15
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,490
are destined to be enemies.

16
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,079
Nothing has changed.

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
Jiayu.

18
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Jiayu.

19
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,400
We are enemies.

20
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,780
Didn't you say you lost it?

21
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,000
You have to go.

22
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
Don't let her down.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
Let's go.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Where can I go?

25
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,730
There will always be

26
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,240
There will always be.

27
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,880
Huo Ran.

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,960
I can't leave.

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,880
You too.

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,200
The only way

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
is to turn into flame.

32
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,079
But one day,

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,090
the fire will go out.

34
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,360
I will let you live.

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
I believe

36
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,000
I won't lie

37
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,940
I don't lie either.

38
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you know why they are there?

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,360
Mr. Tang

40
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
of course you have your own consideration.

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,160
Because they are playing tricks under my nose.

42
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,880
Mr. Huo,

43
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Don't you have anything to say to me?

44
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,320
You must be joking.

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
How could I?

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
The drug guide that escaped

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
was Young Lady Yu Zhu, right?

48
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,440
Huo Ting Shan, how dare you!

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,320
Mr. Tang.

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
I was wrong.

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,720
Enough.

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Stop acting.

53
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,680
One month.

54
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,920
I'll make sure she gets married.

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,160
One month.

56
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,440
That girl

57
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
to buy time.

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,360
One month.

59
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,560
just an excuse.

60
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,400
to lower her guard.

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,130
A gentleman keeps his word.

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,880
Unfortunately, I'm never a gentleman.

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
Do you understand?

64
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,210
Father-in-law.

65
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll deliver them to you.

66
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,700
Have you checked everything?

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Watch the door today.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Don't let anyone out.

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Okay.

70
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,000
Count everything.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Okay.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,360
What is this?

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
My lady,

74
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,240
These are Lady Ruan's dowries.

75
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,140
How dare you bring shame on this kind of girl?

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
Forget it.

77
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,080
For the sake of the Huo family,

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280
I'll pick one for her.

79
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,600
You don't have to do this.

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Move.

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,880
Miss Leng.

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Master specifically ordered that

83
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
marriage is a big deal.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,760
Before Lady Ruan leaves,

85
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
no one is allowed to walk around.

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,760
Please forgive me.

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
Where is Steward Zhong?

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,200
Tell him to tell me.

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
Steward Zhong went home for his funeral.

90
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
He's not at home.

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,560
Please forgive me.

92
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Goodbye, Young Lady.

93
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,240
I got it.

94
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,200
That day, Master went out in the morning

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
he went to Tang Jing's house.

96
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
Steward Zhong didn't leave the city.

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,680
He bought a kind of medicine in the dark market these days.

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
called

99
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,090
Unconsciously.

100
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
It's a hallucinogenic incense.

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,660
Tsukki!

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,720
I'll find a way to solve this.

103
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,240
You hide it from Lady Ruan.

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,320
By then...

105
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Sister.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,610
What are you trying to hide from me?

107
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,000
Tell me.

108
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
A few days ago,

109
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,690
Mount Huo went to Tang Jing's hunting ground.

110
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,220
He sealed the mansion after he came back.

111
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,100
Steward Zhong is a trusted aide of Mount Huo.

112
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,200
But now, he lied about going back to his hometown for his funeral.

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
But he bought some drugs.

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,650
I suspect...

115
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,159
You suspect

116
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
they want to do it in advance?

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,760
What do you want to do?

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
Let's play along.

119
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,920
I'll take you away halfway.

120
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,020
If you can't hand him over,

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,400
Tang Jing won't let Huo Ting Shan off.

122
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay.

123
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,210
I'll wait for you to save me.

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
So obedient.

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,960
It hurts.

126
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,680
Just kidding.

127
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Huo Ran.

128
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,539
This is the last time I lied to you.

129
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,840
Our lives are tied together.

130
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,400
I don't want to waste more time to doubt and hide.

131
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Huo Ran.

132
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,400
From now on,

133
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
you can't lie to me.

134
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,960
Okay?

135
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,480
Okay.

136
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,360
This way.

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,720
Okay.

138
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,400
Hurry up.

139
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh no.

140
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,160
It's all thanks to you.

141
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
That's right.

142
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,170
If you hadn't been suspicious,

143
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,650
how could it be so smooth

144
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
How did it go so smoothly?

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Humph.

146
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,440
Almost.

147
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
It's done after this intersection.

148
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,640
Miss.

149
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
Who are you?

150
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,440
Looks like I underestimated Mount Huo.

151
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,600
I didn't expect that besides the Huo family,

152
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
he has a backup plan.

153
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,200
Jiayu.

154
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,200
Huo Ran.

155
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,680
Huo Ran.

156
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,280
What are you doing?

157
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,880
I didn't expect

158
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,640
your relationship

159
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,640
is so deep.

160
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
Why did you save her?

161
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,520
In your eyes,

162
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,920
your daughter is a living Buddha?

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
You know better than I do.

164
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
How can a kind person

165
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,080
can't stand in Yuncheng.

166
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm just not convinced.

167
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
Why?

168
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,620
Song Jiayu will be promoted by a noble lady and make a comeback?

169
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
I've been working hard for more than ten years.

170
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I can't compare to a country girl.

171
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
In this world,

172
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
in this world is me.

173
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,400
I was just pretending.

174
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,640
and said something nice.

175
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,930
she takes it seriously.

176
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Shallow.

177
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
The Huo family is equally equal.

178
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
You don't even understand such a simple thing.

179
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,420
Go back and reflect on your mistakes.

180
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,080
Tonight,

181
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,520
I'll send her out myself.

182
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,040
We'll share weal and woe.

183
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,920
Father.

184
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
Are you sure?

185
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,520
Mr. Tang values her so much.

186
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
One day,

187
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,920
if she climbs up the ladder,

188
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,780
how can she not forget her origin?

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,320
You did give her a life,

190
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,720
but you didn't raise her.

191
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,640
In her heart,

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,000
the Huo family is nothing.

193
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,520
Father.

194
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,160
Don't make wedding clothes for others.

195
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,800
Tell me, what should we do?

196
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
In the Huo family,

197
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,520
even a dog

198
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,520
even if it's a dog.

199
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,520
Well said.

200
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,720
In that case,

201
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
I'll leave this to you.

202
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
If you fail,

203
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,520
we must send her out tonight.
