1
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,580
A chance to test me.

2
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,120
What are you waiting for?

3
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,640
Throw it in the river.

4
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
Get it out of my sight.

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,180
Miss Tai, everything's fine now.

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
How is she?

7
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
All is well.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,260
Don't worry, Miss.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,240
Our people at the casino

10
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,000
have all been withdrawn.

11
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,180
No one noticed.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,329
It seems I've underestimated her.

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,920
Perhaps

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,880
she's stronger than I thought.

15
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Miss,

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,079
what should we do next?

17
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,920
Song Jiayu's show is over.

18
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,200
Now it's my turn.

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
Why are you panicking?

20
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,840
Just go.

21
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
It tastes good.

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,560
Oh.

23
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,360
The young lady asked me to buy it.

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Sister, just wait and see.

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,040
Director Tang,

26
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,800
sorry to keep you waiting.

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,370
Huo Tingshan has really lost his mind.

28
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,200
Who do you think you are?

29
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
You're not qualified to negotiate with me.

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Director Tang,

31
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,360
I stand here today with only one identity:

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,820
a member of the Huo family.

33
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,580
The Huo family rises and falls as one.

34
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,200
No matter who they send,

35
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,220
this principle remains the same.

36
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,080
You're quite sharp-tongued for a little girl.

37
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,480
So tell me,

38
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,240
what kind of explanation is the Huo family prepared to give me?

39
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,600
If we can't reach an agreement,

40
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,200
that shipment is lost.

41
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,200
The Huo family can't compensate for it.

42
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,480
However,

43
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,400
we've prepared another generous gift for you.

44
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
As the saying goes,

45
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,880
a blessing in disguise.

46
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,800
Mrs. Wang,

47
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,840
please do me a favor

48
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,900
and don't let anyone know about this.

49
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
Mm-hmm.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,560
What's going on with that Huo kid?

51
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
Nothing much.

52
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,420
He's probably just young and impulsive,

53
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
overestimating himself.

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
I heard that Southeast Asian merchant was seen at your place.

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,660
Have you heard anything about it?

56
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,040
No.

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,600
In that case,

58
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll have to demand an explanation from the Huo family.

59
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,600
I want to see what other tricks Huo Tingshan has up his sleeve.

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Boss,

61
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
Tang Jing already suspects you.

62
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,920
With his temperament, he won't let this go.

63
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,400
What should we do?

64
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,320
The mole we planted

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,520
should be pulled out now.

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
That makes sense.

67
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,600
You placed a spy near him

68
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,720
to investigate the accounts.

69
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,380
Now that we have the evidence,

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
it's the perfect time to make a clean exit.

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
We just need the right opportunity.

72
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,640
By the way, Boss,

73
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,680
someone just delivered something.

74
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
An opportunity

75
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,530
might have just come knocking.

76
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,680
It's quite a good deal.

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,400
However,

78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,810
are you willing to part with it?

79
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,400
You...

80
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,600
Second Miss, don't worry.

81
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,980
The Dragon Tiger Gang has been around for years,

82
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,560
we always have a few tricks up our sleeves.

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,200
As long as I'm the one who fires that day,

84
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
it will be foolproof.

85
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,520
How do you know Tang Jing will let you do it?

86
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,200
Because he's paranoid,

87
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,250
he won't miss any opportunity.

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
Hmm.

89
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,880
Why did you arrest me?

90
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,420
Sister, someone asked me to give this to you.

92
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,680
We meet again.

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
How dare you.

94
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
With this in my possession, I have the courage.

95
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,960
After all,

96
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,880
this is your biggest secret.

97
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,760
This Western medicine causes muscle weakness.

98
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,360
As long as it's taken regularly at the right dose,

99
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,620
it can create the illusion of paralysis.

100
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
As expected of the Dragon Tiger Gang's leader.

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Ruthless to others,

102
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
even more ruthless to yourself.

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,840
Nonsense.

104
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,760
You've got a bag of fake medicine

105
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,280
and made up a bunch of ridiculous lies.

106
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
Trading a shipment to expose a mole.

107
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,970
Would you say this deal is worth it?

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,960
This generous gift shows the Huo family's sincerity.

109
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Wait.

110
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,080
Liyan.

111
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,360
You do it.

112
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,760
Alright.

113
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
That's our Dragon Tiger Gang brother Ning Zheng.

114
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,280
He's been undercover with Tang Jing for years.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
Without raising any suspicion.

116
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,520
But after Huo Zhijie's shipment went missing,

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,800
Tang Jing became suspicious of him.

118
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
The thief crying 'catch the thief.'

119
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
Sacrificing one brother to gain Tang Jing's trust.

120
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,440
The process doesn't matter.

121
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,880
What matters is the result.

122
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Pleasure doing business with you.

123
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Orange cake.

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,480
Miss, something terrible has happened!

125
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,200
This is a message from Director Tang.

126
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,000
He demands the Huo family send someone tonight

127
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,360
to give him an explanation.

128
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Otherwise,

129
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,730
otherwise he'll...

130
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,610
You're threatening me.

131
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,540
As long as I say something,

132
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,200
people will believe it.

133
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
Whether it's true or false

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,460
is the least important thing.

135
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't you agree?

136
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,280
Song Jiayu.

137
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,800
This is how you repay kindness with betrayal.

138
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,360
What kindness?

139
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,610
Everything before was just business.

140
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,540
You got a whole shipment for free.

141
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Don't act smart after getting such a good deal.

142
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,050
Aren't you the same?

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
You caused a huge disaster,

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,160
made such a big mess,

145
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,300
destroyed Huo Zhijie in one move,

146
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,780
and got a chance to show off in front of Huo Tingshan.

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Looks like killing two birds with one stone.

148
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,160
But your real target is Huo Ran.

149
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,560
You want to calm Tang Jing's mind

150
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
by outranking her in the Huo family.

151
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,720
But you know that by yourself,

152
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,600
you can't fight this battle alone,

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
so you plan to drag me into it.

154
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,320
Second Miss,

155
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
you really are quite the schemer.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,930
Unfortunately,

157
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
I might not have such capabilities.

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
No,

159
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
you do.

160
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,010
If I'm not mistaken,

161
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,760
you've placed a mole by Tang Jing's side, haven't you?

162
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,800
I'll inform the boss about this matter.

163
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,680
What are you trying to do?

164
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,300
Work together from inside and outside to put on a good show.

165
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
Consider yourself lucky.

166
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,220
If I didn't already have the same intention,

167
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,320
did you really think I would yield to your threats?

168
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,400
Right?

169
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,440
Sister, what are you doing?
