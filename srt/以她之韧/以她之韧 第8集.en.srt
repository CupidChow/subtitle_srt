1
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,320
These days

2
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,140
I've been looking for you.

3
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,759
Why?

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,210
I don't recall us being that close.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Why?

6
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
You tell me.

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,090
You have a debt to pay

8
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,940
that I haven't collected yet.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
What debt?

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
That day

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,240
you drugged me on my neck.

12
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,889
I'm right, aren't I?

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
Do you have any proof?

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,920
Brother-in-law,

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm not going to pay for your affairs.

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,600
If there's nothing else,

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll be going now.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
Song Jiayu.

19
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,610
You're not going anywhere.

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
From now on,

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,560
if you take one step outside this place,

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,440
Huo Ran

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
will immediately get the news.

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,079
So,

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
whether you stay or go,

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,120
it's your choice.

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
You...

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,680
Fine.

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
I'll stay.

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,600
From now on,

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,610
you will do exactly as I say.

32
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,200
As you wish.

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Sister.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,400
Are you feeling unwell?

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,079
Hmm.

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,600
Come.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,680
Take it slow.

38
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,040
Good.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,810
Open your mouth.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Is it sweet?

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Sister,

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,079
your medicine works quite well.

43
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm not in pain anymore.

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,260
Good that it works.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,610
However,

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,480
this medicine has quite a unique smell.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,399
I've heard

48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
that wealthy families used to hire famous doctors to make medicine,

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
and the medicines they created had unique flavors

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,980
that couldn't be replicated.

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,120
For example,

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
the Huo family.

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,570
Have you heard about that, Sister?

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,080
They were probably deceived by those medical shops.

55
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,340
There are thousands of medicinal herbs,

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,720
and many have similar properties.

57
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,760
For instance, astragalus and sophora tonkinensis

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,720
both have a bean-like odor.

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
The claim of unique scents is probably just a marketing trick.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Is that so?

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
If you're interested,

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,480
I'll take you to a medical shop someday.

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Mm-hmm.

64
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
I've heard

65
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
there's a Zhao's pastry shop next to the medical shop.

66
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,880
Their orange cakes are especially delicious.

67
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,010
If we get the chance,

68
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,290
let's go try them together.

69
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
I'll go make some preparations.

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,570
We'll have dinner soon.

71
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,620
Since you're Mrs. Wang's friend,

72
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
I'll definitely help you with this.

73
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,560
From what I know,

74
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,960
the young master of the Huo family is short on cash lately.

75
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,560
Short on cash?

76
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,280
Yes.

77
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,680
His older sister,

78
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,620
Huo Ran, is quite formidable.

79
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,780
Somehow she convinced Mr. Huo

80
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,880
to cut the young master's allowance by half.

81
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
Now he's really strapped for cash.

82
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,730
No wonder he frequents the casino.

83
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,780
So he's lost money.

84
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,680
Boss.

85
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,060
Someone saw the second young lady at our casino.

86
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,480
Yes.

87
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,960
I've heard

88
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
the young master Huo has stockpiled some goods

89
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,120
waiting to turn his luck around.

90
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
However,

91
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,600
that's beyond what I can find out.

92
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,760
Perhaps

93
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
in the VIP room,

94
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,360
someone who serves me might know.

95
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,840
Yes, you.

96
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,400
Young Master Huo, you're here.

97
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,880
This way, please.

98
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
Wait.

99
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,480
There was someone else here just now.

100
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Young Master Huo, you must be mistaken.

101
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
It's only me here.

102
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Move aside.

103
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,080
I want to see

104
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,160
which ignorant servant

105
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,160
dares to put on airs in front of me.

106
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,640
Get out here now!

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
Zhijie.

108
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,680
Brother-in-law.

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
Don't be so angry.

110
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,400
In the Dragon Tiger Gang's territory,

111
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,560
who exactly are you ordering around?

112
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,960
No, no, brother-in-law.

113
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,880
I have something to do. I'll leave first.

114
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,040
Stop right there.

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,640
Miss,

116
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
why are you leaving without saying goodbye

117
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,700
just like that?

118
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,920
Aren't you going

119
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
to thank me?

120
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,960
Did you find her?

121
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,340
We've contacted an informant

122
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,880
who claims to know Miss's whereabouts.

123
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Miss,

124
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,880
what if it's a trap?

125
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,400
Even if there's only a one in 10,000 chance,

126
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,680
I still have to go.

127
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
Some foolish traitor tipped off the master.

128
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,970
Fortunately, our people have caught him.

129
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,140
We're just waiting for you to deal with him personally.

130
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
I understand.

131
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,040
Sister.

132
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,160
Jiayu.

133
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Jiayu.

134
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
Jiayu.

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,520
Jiayu.

136
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Mrs. Wang, thank you for your help last time.

137
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,760
Jiayu, don't worry.

138
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,160
I've infiltrated the Huo family as a worker.

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,120
From now on,

140
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
you'll have someone to help you.

141
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,120
Thank you.

142
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,780
I've found out who harmed you.

143
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,960
Huo Ran.

144
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
It's not her.

145
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
Hmm.

146
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
Oh, right.

147
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,220
This person might be able to help you.

148
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,480
Okay.

149
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,360
Hmm.

150
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
Sister.

151
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,560
Sister.

152
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,400
Sister.

153
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,290
I haven't had time to get the medicine yet.

154
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,960
Sister.

155
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,200
Sister.

156
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,120
Sister.

157
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll go get medicine for you.

158
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,960
And water.

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
And a doctor.

160
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
Jiayu.

161
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't be afraid.

162
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,120
Go back to your room and rest.

163
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm fine.

164
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,400
I'll be better soon.

165
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,380
I'll stay with you.

166
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,540
Don't fear the small boat.

167
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,340
Don't fear the high waves.

168
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,600
Row harder.

169
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,280
Rock, rock, rock.

170
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,010
Rowing past the front village.

171
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,210
Crossing the stone bridge.

172
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,200
Miss.

173
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,200
The opium you deliberately destroyed before.
