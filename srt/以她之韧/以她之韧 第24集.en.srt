1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,260
Don't come any closer.

2
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,960
Huo Tingshan.

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
I'll make you pay back

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,920
everything you owe me.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,520
Don't worry,

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,039
I won't kill you.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,320
Death would be a release.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
And you

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,040
are destined to live in hell.

10
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,820
What are you afraid of?

11
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Isn't this exactly what you did to me back then?

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
No.

13
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
You don't have a choice.

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,760
The Dragon Tiger Gang was originally founded for righteousness.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,360
My master's wish was to help and save the world.

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,920
Although the Dragon Tiger Gang now controls Yun City,

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,920
we can't establish ourselves just through violence.

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,820
Nor can we fulfill my master's wish that way.

19
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,780
So I plan to go to the West to study.

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,900
When I return someday,

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
I intend to establish businesses in Yun City

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,120
to accomplish more.

23
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
I believe

24
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
you can definitely do it.

25
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
Song Jiayu.

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,560
Why don't I give you the Dragon Tiger Gang's casino?

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
I heard you're establishing a women's college.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,480
How's it going?

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I can't accept such a generous gift.

30
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,900
I'd be too indebted to you.

31
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,079
What about Huo Ran?

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Aren't you afraid

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
of owing her too much?

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
She owes me too.

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,120
This messy debt will probably take a lifetime to settle.

36
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
Song Jiayu at nineteen.

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,680
The favor she did me,

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
I repaid at twenty-five.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Life is vast.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
You and I

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,330
must both take care.

42
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Thank you

43
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,720
What for?

44
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
For everything.

45
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm not used to you

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
not threatening me anymore.

47
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,860
No need for thanks between us.

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,800
Once in a lifetime,

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,480
meeting you

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
has been my fortune.

51
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,720
You're leaving Yun City.

52
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,640
It's over.

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,080
Mom.

54
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,880
It's dawn.

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,560
Miss.

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,380
The illegal drugs that Huo Tingshan sold

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,240
have all been destroyed.

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
Yes.

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
Don't touch those trade routes for now.

60
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,080
I've already contacted the provincial authorities.

61
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,140
We'll round them all up once we gather enough evidence.

62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,640
Remember,

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,060
don't alert the enemy.

64
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,920
Mrs. Wang, how are things on your end?

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,400
Don't worry, Miss.

66
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,080
The Jiang family's foundation is still intact.

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Look,

68
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
these are the orders from our hospital partnership.

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,340
The prices of these herbs,

70
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
as you instructed,

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
are set just to break even, not for profit.

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
On the 1st and 15th of each month,

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,620
the elderly, weak, and disabled can get free medicine.

74
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Very good.

75
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
As merchants,

76
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,410
business is what matters most.

77
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Making money isn't urgent.

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,880
We have plenty of time ahead.

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,560
Miss,

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,930
my boss would like to meet with you.

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Father.

82
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
Did you sleep well?

83
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
Huo Ran.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,600
So you're really not dead.

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,240
Perhaps you're the one who's dead.

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,800
Stop playing these mind games.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,760
This mundane world isn't worth clinging to anyway.

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,960
The Huo family is finished regardless.

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
What did you say?

90
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,880
Thanks to you.

91
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
I discovered the Huo family was hiding another shipment.

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,530
When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter.

93
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,440
Without a leader,

94
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,320
only underlings remain,

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,680
who can't withstand torture.

96
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,600
Guess

97
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,600
where that shipment is now.

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
You ungrateful child!

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,530
Wretched creature!

100
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,159
Damn you!

101
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,640
I'll just start over if I have to.

102
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,570
I, Huo Tingshan,

103
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,360
rose from nothing

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
to the top of Yun City.

105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,080
I will rise again someday.

106
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,280
You think you can bring me down?

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,080
Too bad.

108
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,480
There's no time left.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,060
An old acquaintance has arrived.

110
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,400
She

111
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
has been waiting for you for a long time.

112
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,280
See you again.

113
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,440
See you again.

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
Being naughty again.

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,280
Sister, you're amazing.

116
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
You've really loved plants and flowers since you were little.

117
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
If I hadn't come to the Huo family,

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
I might have become a gardener.

119
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,919
Sister.

120
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,480
About the business matters,

121
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,520
are you really not going to handle them anymore?

122
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
What?

123
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,159
Didn't you say you wanted to become me?

124
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,620
Now you have all the power,

125
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,540
and you're not happy about it?

126
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,840
Sister.

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,640
Jiayu.

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,800
Yes?

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm truly exhausted after all these years.

130
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
I'll be counting on you from now on.

131
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
That may be so,

132
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,680
but I have a new job for you

133
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,740
that you can't refuse.

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
What's this?

135
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,900
Get ready to take office, Principal.

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,400
Kill me.

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,880
Father, you're joking.

138
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,960
As your child,

139
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,880
how could I commit such a terrible act?

140
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
Mother has lived here half her life,

141
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
yet you can't bear it after just a few days.

142
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,320
Huo Ran.

143
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,540
Do you think Song Jiayu

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,760
will truly tolerate you?

145
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
One day,

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
she will take everything from you.

147
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Power,

148
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
wealth,

149
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,880
status.

150
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
These things

151
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,080
cannot be shared with others.

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,410
No need to wait for that day.

153
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,880
If she wants them,

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,960
I will gladly hand them over.

155
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,800
It's time.

156
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,520
Let me help you take your medicine, Father.

157
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,520
Miss and Second Miss, hurry!

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,920
It's the auspicious time.

159
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
Alright.

160
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,880
Miss, the new batch of medicine has arrived.

161
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,520
Good. Wait over there.

162
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Okay.

163
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
This shipment must be dealt with within this week.

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
It hurts.

165
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
Women, just like men,

166
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,160
need a strong body to achieve great things.

167
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,120
Continue.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sister.

169
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,460
It's time to end class.

170
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Class dismissed.

171
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,140
Wen Liyan is departing today.

172
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,040
He might be on that ship.

173
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
I truly hope that the children of Yun City

174
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
will one day board ships for distant journeys too.

175
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,320
With us here,

176
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
that day will surely come.

177
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Teacher.

178
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,120
Play with us.

179
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,160
Let's play together, Teacher.

180
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,340
It's the sound of a steamship.

181
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,240
Where will they go?

182
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
Yes, where will they go?

183
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,280
To a bigger world.

184
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
Will that world be better?

185
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
It will be.

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
As long as you all are there.
