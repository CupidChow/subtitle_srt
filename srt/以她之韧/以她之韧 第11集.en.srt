1
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,400
Director Tang is about to host a birthday party.

2
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,330
This event is of great importance.

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,800
Our Huo family absolutely cannot lose face.

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,480
Jiayu, do you understand?

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,520
I understand, Father.

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,600
It's just...

7
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,440
Do you have any concerns?

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,479
Feel free to speak up.

9
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,960
I've never attended a party before.

10
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,420
I don't know how to choose the right clothes.

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
However,

12
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,600
if my sister is willing to help me,

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,759
I shouldn't make a fool of myself.

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,039
Father.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,039
That's not difficult at all.

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,800
Father.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,759
Good.

18
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,880
Well done, Jiayu.

19
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,240
You've accomplished something great.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
You flatter me, Father.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,360
Truly worthy of being my daughter.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
The Huo family will be counting on you from now on.

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
Father.

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,900
Here are last month's account books.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,460
Give them to Jiayu.

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
By the way.

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,440
Jiayu's courtyard is a bit small.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
Give yours to her.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
Sister.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Things that don't belong to you,

31
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,680
no matter how tightly you hold them,

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,970
will eventually slip away.

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,280
I told you before,

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
I will take back everything,

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
one by one.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,079
The Huo family indeed has a child who excels at Go.

37
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,010
Who once showed great talent in major competitions.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
Unfortunately, photos are missing.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Or hidden within the Huo household.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
Miss, what's wrong?

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,079
Nothing.

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,290
Just a stray cat.

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,520
Let's go see Father.

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
Yes.

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
Father.

46
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,640
Speak. What is it?

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,930
Father is right.

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
Director Tang's banquet is a matter of great importance.

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
There will inevitably be Western dancing to liven up the event.

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
Why don't I

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,490
guide Jiayu in some practice beforehand,

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,640
to avoid any mistakes when the time comes.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
You're always so thoughtful.

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Let's do that.

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,200
Miss.

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
When that woman was investigating the villa,

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,400
you had already noticed.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,840
Why did you deliberately leave clues

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,560
to lure the Second Miss in?

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Rather than hiding everything,

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,360
it's better to expose the truth myself.

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,280
After all, hearing something a thousand times

64
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,409
isn't as convincing as seeing it once with your own eyes.

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,640
People will always trust their own judgment.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,240
Especially the clever ones.

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,680
Now

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,280
she should have given up.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
How could this be?

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,800
The Go expert in the Huo family

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,440
is actually Huo Zhijie.

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,400
Miss.

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,640
Why would you rather be beaten

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,810
than reveal you know how to play Go?

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,280
No, Ayue.

76
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
I can't compete with Huo Zhijie for anything right now.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
Mother has just passed away,

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,160
there are undercurrents in the Huo family.

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
Only by hiding my abilities can I stay safe.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
Whether I can play Go doesn't matter at all.

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,060
Huo Tingshan only wants to test my attitude.

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,880
He wants me to willingly be a dog,

83
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
paving the way for the Huo family.

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,200
If Madam knew about this,

85
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,340
she would be heartbroken.

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,970
Mother taught me to play Go.

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,080
Only because

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
the person she truly wanted to play with

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
was no longer by her side.

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Sister,

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,080
what are you doing?

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,480
Didn't you keep asking me

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,060
why I haven't made a move against you?

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
Now I'll grant your wish.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
Quite lively here.

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,880
Director Tang.

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Huo Ran,

98
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
it's been a while.

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,880
Why has your temper gotten worse?

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,080
Director Tang, please excuse me.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,130
This person doesn't know her place

102
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
and dared to show off in front of you.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,860
She has disgraced the Huo family.

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm just following family rules

105
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,060
to give you a proper explanation.

106
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Who said that?

107
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,880
I think the Second Miss is quite impressive,

108
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,480
brave and resourceful, surviving against all odds.

109
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,880
As for you, Huo Ran,

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
you should control your temper.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Yes.

112
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560
Second Miss,

113
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,000
until we meet again.

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,020
Miss, your qipao has arrived.

115
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,160
Please come try it on.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Sister.

117
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,500
Since you're wearing a qipao,

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,570
why not add a fan to match it?

119
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,340
But this pattern isn't very good.

120
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,880
Let's change it to orioles and butterflies.

121
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,480
What do you think?

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
Could it really be you?

123
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
This medicine has quite a unique smell.

124
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,240
Where is your pendant?

125
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,280
That worthless thing? I threw it away long ago.

126
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
Orange cake.

127
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,760
It tastes good.

128
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,280
The young miss asked me to buy it.

129
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's change it to orioles and butterflies.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,960
Jiayu.

131
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
I have results for the matter you entrusted to me last time.

132
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,200
Mrs. Wang, do you have any news?

133
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,260
Jiayu, are you sure it was that villa?

134
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,680
I'm certain.

135
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,410
After that person saved me,

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,280
they placed me in that villa.

137
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,410
Later I had to return to the Huo family,

138
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,680
and I couldn't find her again.

139
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,560
I just want to thank her in person.

140
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,880
This person is meticulous and cautious.

141
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,480
I've made many inquiries and finally got a lead.

142
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
But...

143
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Tell me.

144
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,800
That villa

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
is under Huo Ran's name.

146
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,600
Mrs. Wang,

147
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,080
could you help me investigate one more thing?

148
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
Sure.

149
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
Huo Ran is all yours now.

150
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
Any problem?

151
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,800
Thank you, sister.

152
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
No good. Next one.

153
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,400
Huo Ran, will you ever be satisfied?

154
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,280
Weren't you the one who asked me to come?

155
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,840
What's wrong?

156
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,560
Having regrets now?

157
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,680
Looking like this,

158
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,560
you want to attend the event?

159
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,370
You're nowhere near ready.

160
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,300
Where's your pendant?

161
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,120
That worthless thing?

162
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,680
I threw it away long ago.
