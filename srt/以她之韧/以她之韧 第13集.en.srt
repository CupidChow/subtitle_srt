1
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,080
As you can see,

2
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,880
I survived

3
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
I survived.

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,480
Good.

5
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,420
take this opportunity

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,130
to announce this good news.

7
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
I've made a deal with the Huo family

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,240
to marry Song Jiayu.

9
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,480
What?

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
It's more important to deal with Mr. Tang.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,880
We'll talk about it later.

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,479
What?

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
Are you afraid I'll run away?

14
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Keep an eye on her.

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,720
Yes, Young Lady Zhen Zhu.

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
Speaking of which,

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,440
Lady Ruan and I are fated to meet.

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,080
Last time,

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
thanks to you,

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
I found out the spy around me.

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
This time,

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,570
he took another stab for me.

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
In that case,

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,680
this marriage is not too sudden.

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,720
Okay.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Not only that,

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,960
This is a perfect match.

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
Yes.

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,860
A match made in heaven.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,200
Mr. Tang and Miss Ruan are a perfect match.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,960
Yes.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,560
Salute.

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
What do you think?

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,800
Boss.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't be impulsive.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,730
Think about Master and the Dragon and Tiger Gang.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
In that case,

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,800
Mr. Huo,

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
How about

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,880
let's set a date today.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,560
Okay.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,320
Then...

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
I disagree.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,960
I disagree.

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,680
Mr. Tang.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,840
Song Jiayu is just a country girl.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
She doesn't deserve you.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
There are many girls

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
in Yun City.

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
As long as you tell me,

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
I'll find it for you.

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,600
Why let that immature thing

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
dirty your eyes?

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120
But I fell in love with her.

55
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,720
What?

56
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,520
Are you going to stop me?

57
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Of course.

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
As her elder sister,

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,040
I know her best.

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,900
She has always been crazy.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,200
She's unruly and unruly.

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,840
If I offend you in the future,

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,280
Could it be...

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
the whole Huo family

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,120
will die with you?

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,760
Mr. Huo.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,280
Your lady is really capable.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,720
You're here to teach me how to do things.

69
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
This rebellious woman.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,080
Father.

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,840
Why are you so angry?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,400
It's bad for your health.

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
Lady Ruoxi.

74
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,380
You came at the right time.

75
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,480
How about

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
tell me.

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,320
Marry...

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,080
or not?

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,800
It's a blessing

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,800
to have Mr. Tang's eyes.

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,680
Of course

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,200
Of course.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,080
Mr. Tang.

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
However,

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
I have a favor to ask.

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,360
Yes?

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,640
What is it?

88
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
Jiayu was born in the Huo family,

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
she has been away for many years.

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,600
Fortunately,

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
I was able to survive

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
to survive.

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,080
To me,

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
she's no different from my birth mother.

95
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,050
Unfortunately,

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,080
My aunt had a severe illness

97
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
and just passed away.

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
If I hold a wedding now,

99
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
So,

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
Jiayu would like to ask you

102
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
to mourn for her for a few days

103
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
to show my sincerity.

104
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,080
Humph.

105
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,560
You really don't know the rules.

106
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
How can a village woman like her

107
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,640
to be mourned for her?

108
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,560
You...

109
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Father.

110
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Don't forget.

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,050
a detective from the provincial hasn't left yet.

112
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Now

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,320
it's a good time for you to get promoted.

114
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
If she makes a scene,

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,640
and something goes wrong,

116
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
why don't we take a break?

117
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,260
and think about it?

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,440
Since you are so filial,

119
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
it's really rare.

120
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,640
I'll give you more time.

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
How about

122
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
just one month?

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,320
Let go of me!

124
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,200
Song Jiayu.

125
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,409
Is there only hatred in your heart?

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,480
You even hurt yourself.

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,320
Of course.

128
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,640
Since I was abandoned when I was six,

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,200
until I came back to the Huo family,

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
I only have one purpose.

131
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,380
You knew it all along, didn't you?

132
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
Why do you keep asking?

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,480
You're angry

134
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,400
because I interfered

135
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,000
and ruined your plan to assassinate Tang Jing.

136
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,570
Is that what you think of me?

137
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,040
What else?

138
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,420
Then why are you angry?

139
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,700
It doesn't matter.

140
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,440
I helped you.

141
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
You helped me too.

142
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,760
I don't owe you anything.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,560
Song Jiayu.

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,730
Since you want revenge,

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,640
is that all you want?

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,080
Use me.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
What?

148
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,600
Let me be the sharpest blade in your hand.

149
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,480
I remember what you said.

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,080
I hope

151
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
will never come true.

152
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,860
Tsukki, get the car ready.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
You're leaving tonight.

155
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,160
You don't have to bring your clothes with you.

156
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,490
Someone will prepare it when we get there.

157
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,800
This is enough.

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,760
What will you do if I leave?

159
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,500
None of your business.

160
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,720
It's none of your business.

161
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,320
Who are you to worry about me?

162
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Huo Ran.

163
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm the unlucky one.

164
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
What's the rush?

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
What do you want?

166
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,040
The answer.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,040
You haven't told me

168
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Is it you, sister?

169
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,480
My lady.

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Master is looking for Lady Ruan.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,730
and asked her to go to the study.

172
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Tell me.

173
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,400
If I tell my father now,

174
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,650
I'm really willing to marry Tang Jing.

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Will he be happy?

176
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Song Jiayu.

177
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,290
That's the only way you can control me.

178
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,040
Maybe when I get into the bridal chamber,

179
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,840
when I enter the bridal chamber.

180
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,960
It's me.

181
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,600
I saved you.

182
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,480
Don't worry.

183
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
I know what to do.

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,520
Father.

185
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,520
Jiayu.

186
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Get up.

187
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,560
You...

188
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
What's wrong?

189
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,040
If you kneel badly,

190
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,880
if you kneel down?

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
Father.

192
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,720
Just now at the banquet,

193
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,400
it was just my measure.

194
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,560
I don't want to marry him.

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,800
I know you feel wronged.

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
Mr. Tang

197
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
is not easy to serve.

198
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,760
But

199
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,340
since everything is settled,

200
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,600
there is no other way.

201
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,120
Jiayu,

202
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
The future of the Huo family depends on you.

203
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm begging you.

204
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,080
Please listen to me.

205
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,760
and give me a way out, okay?

206
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,120
I don't want to.

207
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,080
I don't want to marry him.

208
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
You have to marry him.

209
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,040
No matter what.

210
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,920
The daughter of the Huo family has no choice.

211
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,560
Song Jiayu.

212
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,840
I advise you not to play tricks.

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,960
Humph.

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Mother.

215
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
No matter what,

216
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
I will protect my sister.

217
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,840
You must protect her too.

218
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,040
Master.

219
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,320
Mr. Tang sent a message

220
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,600
to have a talk at home tomorrow morning.

221
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,960
This...

222
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
My lady.

223
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,840
Why do you have to go through this?

224
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,240
I'm fine.

225
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,240
It's just a test.

226
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,600
We don't have any costumes in Mount Huo Ting anymore.

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,480
I knew it.

228
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,280
You're good at selling girls for glory.

229
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,840
All these years,

230
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,400
Huo Ran also lived like this?

231
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,280
What are you going to do next?

232
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
To find someone.

233
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
Where?

234
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,970
I've been looking for her everywhere.

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,420
Suddenly looking back

236
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
[But he's in the middle of the lights.]
