1
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
Catch her!

2
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,640
Drive now!

3
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Hurry up!

4
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Wen Liyan!

5
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,820
What are you doing?

6
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm warning you!

7
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,520
Come here!

8
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,520
Come here!

9
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,579
We can't stay here.

10
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's go.

11
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,920
Wen Liyan.

12
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,760
This favor

14
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
I won't forget it.

15
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Your life ends here!

16
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,320
The young lady is still alive.

17
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,560
In my opinion,

18
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
her death could be our turning point.

19
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,520
Go on.

20
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
We can hold a funeral for her,

21
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,080
make a grand gesture,

22
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
and restore our reputation.

23
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,240
Good.

24
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,140
We'll do as you suggested.

25
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,370
You'll be in charge of the funeral.

26
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Don't disappoint me.

27
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Some say

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,360
a handful of soil

29
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,890
and a bouquet of flowers

30
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
is how we say goodbye.

31
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,680
The Huo family has treated her quite well.

32
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,159
Father.

33
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
She was an orphan.

34
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,120
She came alone and left alone.

35
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
But on her journey to the afterlife,

36
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
she has you as company,

37
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,740
so she won't be lonely.

38
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,740
Just a petty trick.

39
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,200
A petty trick.

40
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,650
What about this?

41
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
Song Jiayu.

42
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Have you gone mad?

43
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
I've been mad for a long time.

44
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Not just here.

45
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
I've planted explosives in every corner

46
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
of this house.

47
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
Do you think

48
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,240
you'll make it out alive?

49
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
Alive?

50
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,820
My sister is already dead.

51
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,240
Why should I live?

52
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
The Huo family killed my sister,

53
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,920
so I'll make the entire Huo family join her in death.

54
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
It's only fair.

55
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,560
Isn't it?

56
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
Jiayu,

57
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,960
truly my good daughter.

58
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,440
Even back then,

59
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,900
I might not have had your courage.

60
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,560
Unfortunately,

61
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
you've forgotten what I taught you.

62
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Being too eager to win

63
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,690
makes it easy to show your hand.

64
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,000
Did you think

65
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,640
I would actually believe you?

66
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,720
Your every move

67
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,640
has been under my watch.

68
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Don't believe me?

69
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,040
Try it.

70
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
Boss.

71
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
Something terrible has happened!

72
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's go.

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
Come.

74
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,920
Come down and help quickly!

75
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Second Miss.

76
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,620
The master requests your presence in his study.

77
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,760
I lost.

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,330
One careless move and everything is lost.

79
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
Jiayu.

80
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,770
You're still too young.

81
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,440
Sometimes when you're too eager to win,

82
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,159
you end up exposing your weaknesses.

83
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,919
Father's lesson is right.

84
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,480
I was too reckless.

85
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
Actually, that day,

86
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,320
you were just one step away

87
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,040
from making me lose everything.

88
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,130
Please tell me, Father,

89
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,090
where did I go wrong?

90
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,800
A cunning rabbit has three burrows,

91
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,880
let alone a person.

92
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,290
The Huo family still has hidden goods.

93
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,840
You catch on quickly.

94
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,960
But unfortunately,

95
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
as long as I'm still around,

96
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
you'll never know where those goods are hidden.

97
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,280
However, that fire you set was quite effective.

98
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,360
Ruthless enough.

99
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Now that's my daughter.

100
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,560
Since the Huo family will be yours sooner or later,

101
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,840
why don't you

102
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,890
help me solve a problem?

103
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Bring her in.

104
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
May all you Huo family members die a terrible death!

105
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
I spit on you!

106
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
Such a loyal servant,

107
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
trying to poison our food

108
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
to avenge Huo Ran.

109
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Jiayu,

110
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,480
what do you think?

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,800
How should we handle this?

112
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
Song Jiayu!

113
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,880
You ungrateful wretch!

114
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,240
The First Miss was so good to you!

115
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
If it weren't for her,

116
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,580
how would I have ended up suffering outside?

117
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Good to me?

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
What a joke!

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,760
I'll kill you!

120
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
Father,

121
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,280
in my opinion,

122
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,080
we can just expel her from the house.

123
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,160
You're actually

124
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,960
quite sentimental about old relationships.

125
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,840
Father, is your reputation not bad enough already?

126
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
Huo Ran just died,

127
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,970
and you're already mistreating her maid.

128
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,850
If the people of Yun City found out about this,

129
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,300
what would they think?

130
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,880
Miss,

131
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
is Huo Tingshan a live-in son-in-law

132
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,440
who stole your mother's property?

133
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,330
Are you involved in the eldest daughter's death?

134
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Miss,

135
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,570
was the Huo family really surnamed Jiang before?

136
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,680
My presence here representing the Huo family

137
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,880
is the best answer.

138
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,210
My sister has just passed away.

139
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,520
I hope everyone

140
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,560
can show some respect.

141
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
Tomorrow our family will hold the funeral.

142
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,800
But we wish to bid her farewell quietly,

143
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
so we won't be inviting you all.

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
However,

145
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,530
justice is in people's hearts.

146
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
Right and wrong,

147
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,580
time will reveal everything.

148
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Sister.

149
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
He's very suspicious.

150
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,120
Only this way

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,560
will he trust you.

152
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Jiayu,

153
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,960
survive.

154
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,320
This

155
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,160
is my choice.

156
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,640
That stab

157
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,620
showed no mercy at all.

158
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,480
I once thought

159
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,240
we could be normal sisters.

160
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,560
But sadly,

161
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,130
fate wouldn't allow it.

162
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,880
Aren't you afraid she'll become a vengeful ghost

163
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,360
and come for your life?

164
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
Then let her come.

165
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,880
Today,

166
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,480
I owe her.

167
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,600
But for the past decade,

168
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,360
she owed me.

169
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,000
Our fates were always meant to be this way.

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,880
One lives,

171
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,160
one dies.

172
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,720
And I

173
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,800
must survive.

174
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Good.

175
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,360
Now that's my daughter.

176
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
From today,

177
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
I will personally

178
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,050
teach you to be a true member of the Huo family.

179
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,560
You two were sisters after all,

180
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,400
that's a special bond.

181
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,280
Why don't

182
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,890
we let you handle

183
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Huo Ran's body?

184
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
No need.

185
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,120
A dog

186
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,960
should be returned to its true master.
