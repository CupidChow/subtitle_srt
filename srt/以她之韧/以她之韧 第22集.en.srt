1
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,400
Duan Ming.

2
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
This is evidence of Hou Tingshan seizing the Jiang family's assets.

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
Go to the press immediately and expose this.

4
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,720
Miss Hou, you-

5
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,600
Don't worry about me. Just go!

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Yes.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,440
Hou Ran!

8
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
Catch her!

9
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,920
Don't run!

10
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:38,960
Hou Ran!

11
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,560
Watch out!

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,000
Go!

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Being the father-in-law of the Dragon Tiger Gang

14
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,880
has really paid off.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Look,

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,960
business from Southeast Asia is coming to us on its own.

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,720
Huo Ran,

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,320
this is all thanks to you.

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,840
Father, you're too kind.

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
Once this deal is closed,

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,240
our family's position in Yun City's business world

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
will be secured.

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,880
If that's the case,

24
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
why don't we host a banquet at home?

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
It will show our sincerity

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,540
and let people in the provincial city

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
know what our family is capable of.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,600
What do you think?

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,060
Let's do as you suggested.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,280
Yes.

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
Huo,

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,520
you dare to mess with me?

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,600
Mr. Zhou,

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
what do you mean by that?

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,280
Stop pretending.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
Where's your merchandise?

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
It's all burned up.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,880
The contract is already signed.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Just get ready to pay compensation.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Let's go.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,240
It's you.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
Why say such hurtful things?

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Your dear cousin

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,420
is about to die for you.

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,240
How could I bear to kill you?

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,440
As long as you're alive,

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
Huo Ran will obey

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,320
like the perfect dog.

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200
In the end,

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
I never saw Wanrou again,

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,240
only her suicide note.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,000
Mother stayed because of me.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
Do you know

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,800
who killed my mother?

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
Huo Tingshan.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
Father.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,290
Mr. Zhou is looking for you.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Oh.

59
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,960
Is that so?

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,400
Since the contract is fine,

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
let's take it.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,880
The signing ceremony is about to begin.

63
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
Isn't the ceremony at nine?

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Many things

65
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,690
are better done sooner than later,

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,980
to avoid unexpected complications.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
Let's go.

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
Thank you for your hard work.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Mr. Zhou,

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
it's truly an honor

71
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,160
for our Huo family to work with you.

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Not at all.

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,890
I'll be counting on your guidance in the future, Mr. Huo.

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,650
I'll take the contract during the commotion,

75
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,440
so Huo Tingshan can't sign it.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,280
No.

77
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
What we want is for him to sign the contract.

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
Closing this deal

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,930
is our key to accessing the warehouse.

80
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,040
Better to remove the firewood than try to cool the boiling water.

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,800
Mother.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Mother.

83
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,560
Into the coffin.

84
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,640
Into the coffin.

85
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,520
You both know what happened after that.

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Huo Tingshan and Tang Jing conspired together

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,860
to murder the old gang leader.

88
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,700
Once the gang leader died,

89
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,080
these secrets were buried with him.

90
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,520
It's all my fault.

91
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,850
Everything is my fault.

92
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
If it weren't for me,

93
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,240
mother wouldn't have...

94
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,420
If that's the case,

95
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,760
we are both accomplices.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,640
If it weren't for me,

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,320
mother

98
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,760
wouldn't have had to endure this from the beginning.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Mother gave us freedom

100
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,080
and everything that was hers.

101
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,760
We must take it all back.

102
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,080
Huo Tingshan must pay for his crimes in blood.

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Indeed.

104
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,360
I understand now.

105
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,840
So Jiang Huai came to save her.

106
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Jiang Wanrou's family was wealthy,

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,160
practicing medicine for generations.

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,240
She was an only child

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
and deeply cherished.

110
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,160
Unfortunately, her parents died young,

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
and the Jiang family had few relatives.

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,400
She was forced to become an orphan,

113
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
guarding immense wealth

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,080
yet filled with sorrow.

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,640
At this time,

116
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,920
Huo Tingshan took advantage

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,200
and married into the Jiang family.

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,530
Years later, I finally learned the truth.

119
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,180
Even before their child was born,

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,580
Huo Tingshan had already ruined Wanrou.

121
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,840
All the Jiang family assets changed hands.

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,760
This beast

123
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,700
actually threatened their daughter's life

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,040
to force Wanrou into silence.

125
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
From then on,

126
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,960
there was no more Jiang family in Yun City,

127
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,090
only the Huo family.

128
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
So mother wasn't just an ordinary sheltered woman.

129
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Everything he has came from her.

130
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,650
Even the Huo mansion

131
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,060
was mother's ancestral home.

132
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,840
But...

133
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,400
Why did mother never mention any of this?

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
When I returned to Yun City,

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,040
Wanrou had just suffered the pain of her daughter's disappearance

136
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,800
and was still enduring Huo Tingshan's torment.

137
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
I wanted to take her away.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,240
But she said

139
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
she still had another child.

140
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
She must go to protect her.

141
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Bitch!

142
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,560
The Jiang family isn't completely dead yet.

143
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,720
Let me tell you,

144
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
no one can take what belongs to the Huo family.

145
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,480
Huo Tingshan.

146
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,210
Everything you have

147
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,680
belongs to our Jiang family.

148
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Shut up!

149
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,440
If you've got the guts, kill me!

150
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
Wanrou...

151
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,960
We've been husband and wife.

152
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,880
Duan Ming,

153
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,740
what exactly is going on here?

154
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Ladies,

155
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,120
our boss found this among the late gang leader's belongings.

156
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,520
He's tied up at the moment,

157
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,640
so he mailed it to you.

158
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,680
He instructed me to deliver it to you personally.

159
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,340
Before my mother passed away,

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,700
she met with the former leader of the Dragon Tiger Gang.

161
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
Why would my mother...

162
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Wait.

163
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,160
Jiang?

164
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,020
Mother once mentioned

165
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,440
she had a cousin who left home when he was young.

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,260
Could it be Jiang Huai?

167
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,160
The Huo family master, in order to seize all the property,

168
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
actually drove his daughter-in-law to death.

169
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,320
No wonder the Huo family is suffering divine punishment.

170
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Yesterday's fire burned all night,

171
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,480
completely destroying everything in the warehouse.

172
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,440
I heard that

173
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,640
those weren't legitimate goods anyway.

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,600
Huo Tingshan should have been removed from power long ago,

175
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,160
before he ruins our Yun City.

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,960
Exactly.

177
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,120
Is there any problem with this medicine?

178
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
Don't worry, I've checked it carefully.

179
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,860
It's not poisoned.

180
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,280
Thank you.

181
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Sister,

182
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,200
drink the antidote quickly.

183
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,680
You'll feel better soon.

184
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,220
You shouldn't risk yourself for me anymore.

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
I don't know my own limits

186
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,760
or what danger really means.

187
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,360
Unless you stay by my side forever,

188
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,220
watching over me closely.

189
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,620
If you're going to watch me, it has to be for life.

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,760
Huo Ran.

191
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,580
You can't go back on your word.

192
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,880
Alright.

193
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,440
Sister!

194
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Sister!

195
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,880
Sister!

196
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
It's you.

197
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
If you hadn't been so clever,

198
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,520
she might have lived a few more years.

199
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,920
No.

200
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,240
It was you

201
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,440
who killed her.

202
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,560
The medicine itself wasn't poisonous,

203
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
but when medicines interact badly,

204
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,300
they can be just as deadly.

205
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,360
Did you think

206
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,660
you could play your little tricks

207
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,000
and fool everyone

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,620
to destroy the Huo family?

209
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,840
From beginning to end,

210
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,690
she was nothing but a dog of the Huo family.

211
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,200
And this

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,530
is the fate of those who betray their masters.

213
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,840
As for you,

214
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,000
you've reduced yourself to this state

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
for the sake of this dog.

216
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,400
How ridiculous.

217
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
But what can I do?

218
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,720
You are my own daughter after all.

219
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
I'll give you one more chance.

220
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,760
Think carefully.

221
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,760
What

222
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,840
will you choose?
