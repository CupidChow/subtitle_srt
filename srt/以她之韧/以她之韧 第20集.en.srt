1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Looking at it this way,

2
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
we really do look like real sisters.

3
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,920
We've been sisters

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,039
for a very long time already.

5
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,560
Everything the Second Miss likes,

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,520
charge her at 50% discount,

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,240
and put the difference on my account.

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Remember, don't ever let this slip.

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Yes.

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
But Miss, if that's the case,

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:35,080
why not just give the Second Miss everything for free?

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
You.

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,860
You don't understand.

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,800
My sister saved money to buy this gift.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,860
How could I possibly disappoint her?

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Where are we going next?

17
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,880
You'll see soon.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Boss, we're here.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Hello.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
Let's fix our clothes a bit.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,600
You two sisters are really close.

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Of course.

23
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Ready?

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
Let's begin then.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,600
Here we go.

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
A little more to the left.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,700
Yes, a bit more to the left.

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
A little more to the left.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,800
More to the left.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,760
Sister.

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,300
Some fisherwoman you are.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,340
You're such a little liar.

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,220
Sister, you lied to me too.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Hmm?

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,420
That clothing store owner...

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,260
knows you, doesn't he?

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Or should I say...

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
you're the owner?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Ahem.

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
I knew it.

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,520
How could it be so cheap?

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320
So you grew up here?

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,520
Yes.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
Well...

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,320
not exactly.

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,740
After we separated that year,

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,300
I wandered around,

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,160
mixing with all sorts of people.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,660
I picked up some skills

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,450
to make a living.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,440
But later,

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,340
I met some friends in the underworld.

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,640
From then on,

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
life got much better.

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
I've been here

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,920
for a long time.

57
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,320
But for me,

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,040
this has always been just a temporary stop.

59
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,180
The Huo family too.

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,120
I don't have a home anymore.

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,960
Song Jiayu.

62
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,840
As long as I'm here, you won't succeed.

63
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,480
Money and wealth are so boring.

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,680
Power is the greatest glory for a woman.

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,980
Isn't that what you want too, sister?

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
Huo Ran.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,800
I want to become you.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,560
You look so good

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
in these clothes.

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
What about me?

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
You look good too.

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,640
You forgot.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,400
You have

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,650
From the beginning,

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,880
this was prepared for you.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,360
Sister.

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,520
Sister.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
I just had one

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
yesterday.

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,140
Just give me one more shot.

81
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,159
Sister.

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
You're already addicted.

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
You can't rely on it anymore.

84
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,880
Don't let it control you anymore.

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Don't cry.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
I promise you.

87
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,280
As long as I'm here,

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
no one can hurt you,

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,940
not even yourself.

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
I will find the antidote for you.

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,040
And all the evidence he provided is confidential.

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,440
That's exactly why

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,330
he could hit Tang Jing's weak spot.

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,880
Seems this person has a close relationship with Tang Jing.

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,740
And this person is very cautious,

96
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,720
leaving no handles for others to grab.

97
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
Lei Yusheng.

98
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
Ting.

99
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
Huo Tingshan.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
That makes sense now.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,560
The evidence Miss Huo brought last time

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,320
was probably deliberately provided by Huo Tingshan.

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,280
Quickly pass this information to them.

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Yes.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,740
Boss, we've got a lead.

106
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,690
The operation in the provincial capital was so swift

107
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
partly because

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,490
you and the young lady had solid evidence.

109
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,400
On the other hand,

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,960
tell me.

111
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,080
Tang Jing had been followed for some time.

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,010
All these years,

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
a mysterious man named Lei Yusheng has been

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,460
collecting evidence of Tang Jing's crimes.

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,880
Are you sure it's this store?

116
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Of course.

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,700
This place isn't cheap at all.

118
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,160
For my sister, it has to be the best in Yun City.

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,800
Don't worry, I have money.

120
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,080
Shh.

121
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Second Miss,

122
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,890
these are all our new arrivals.

123
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,880
Please take your time.

124
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,050
I won't disturb you.

125
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
Thank you.

126
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,730
Are these for me?

127
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Yes.

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,060
Sister, what am I going to do with you?

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,280
You're so young,

130
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
but always wearing such dull colors.

131
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,880
It makes you look 10 years older.

132
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,920
If I don't appear mature, how will people respect me?

133
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
That's the eldest Miss of the Huo family.

134
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,040
Today,

135
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,360
you're just my sister.

136
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,960
Go try them on.

137
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
Please.

138
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,240
There's a surprise coming later.

139
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
Jiayu.

140
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,400
Jiayu.

141
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,200
Jiayu, you...

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,850
Please take me with you on your trip south.

143
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,880
Bringing back Master's ashes

144
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
to the Dragon Tiger Gang for his final rest

145
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
is of utmost importance.

146
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Tang Jing's words seem strange.

147
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,290
You stay in Yun City.

148
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,920
By the way,

149
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
have you found any information?

150
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,800
Not yet.

151
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
Let me know immediately when you have news.

152
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,520
Won't you personally say goodbye to the second miss before you leave?

153
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,720
No need. I'll be back.

154
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,660
You did a great job.

155
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
You flatter me, sir.

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Second Miss, where are you going?

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,860
The Huo family.

158
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Huo Ran's attacks are happening more and more frequently.

159
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,320
I must go to the Huo family

160
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,450
to get the antidote.

161
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
Second Miss, you can't go there.

162
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,880
Why not?

163
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,420
How did you get in here?

164
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,020
Something serious has happened.

165
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
Before the boss left,

166
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,400
he asked me to thoroughly investigate who's behind Tang Jing.

167
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,480
Huo Tingshan has likely been planning this all along.

168
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
All these years, he's been using the alias Lei Yusheng

169
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
to secretly report on Tang Jing.

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
I never expected

171
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,650
he would secure this position so quickly.

172
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,000
It's getting late.

173
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,080
Let's get going.

174
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm glad you're back.

175
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,170
There's been unrest in Cloud City lately.

176
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,170
It's not safe anywhere.

177
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,970
With you all away from home,

178
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
I've been on edge the whole time.

179
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,240
I couldn't sleep soundly at all.

180
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Really?

181
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I thought with us not being home,

182
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,920
you would sleep more peacefully.

183
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,160
Jiayu.

184
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
Before,

185
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,370
I failed you as a father.

186
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,240
Tang Jing repeatedly

187
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,440
threatened the lives of our family

188
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,560
to force you into marriage.

189
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
I had no choice

190
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,240
but to let you marry him first,

191
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,900
to buy some time

192
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,690
while figuring out a solution.

193
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,740
I was determined to bring you back to our family.

194
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,210
No matter what I say,

195
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
I've let you down.

196
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,600
I wasn't capable enough

197
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,240
and made you suffer.

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,280
You're being too modest.

199
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,240
How could you possibly lack ability?

200
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
If you weren't capable,

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,520
how could you become Cloud City's new director so quickly?

202
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,850
Oh, what a coincidence!

203
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,490
Both the eldest and second young ladies are here.

204
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,660
I've been sent by the master to escort both young ladies

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
back home.

206
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
It's getting late.

207
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,200
Perhaps another day.

208
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,160
As you say, miss.

209
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,000
However,

210
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,840
if I fail to bring both young ladies home safely,

211
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,280
these old bones of mine

212
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
won't be able to answer to the master.
