17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,190
Miss,

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
you have been busy all day.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,880
Have some tea and take a break.

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,960
Miss.

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,470
Crown Prince and Second Prince

22
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,910
are going at it in the front yard again.

23
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,800
General and Madam said that

24
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,750
you must deal with the trouble of

25
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,990
your love life by yourself.

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,040
I don't want to move,

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,110
listen to it

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,270
nor care about it.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm really sick!

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sick.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
You must be tired, Princess Hua.

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,120
Let me pour you a cup of hot water.

33
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,120
Then,

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
I will place it right here.

35
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,040
Don't forget to drink it.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
Your Highness,

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
forgive me for not greeting you.

38
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm not feeling so well.

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,910
You should drink more hot water

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,560
if you aren't feeling well.

41
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,790
These two cups of water
have become cold.

42
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,910
Let me pour you
another cup of hot water.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,510
Your Highness,

44
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,120
there's no point

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,600
drinking hot water.

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,350
Why don't you

47
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,350
go to my parents' room?

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,070
My medication

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,510
is in their room.

50
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,720
(She's trying to get rid of me,)

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,910
(but this is such a rare opportunity)

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,720
(to enter)

53
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,560
(her parents' room.)

54
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,190
Never mind.

55
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,560
How can I bother

56
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,630
Your Highness

57
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,040
to do such a thing?

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,070
Yuan Wei.

59
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,950
No need for that.

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,000
It is a pleasure for me

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,000
to serve you, Princess Hua.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,560
I will go.

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,950
I will go.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,040
Song and Yuan Wei, please escort him.

65
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,990
Your Highness.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,310
Your Highness.

67
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,670
Your Highness.

68
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,960
Why won't you look at me?

69
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,720
Don't be mad.

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,870
You know that He Yuanting

71
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,160
is cunning

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,430
and persistent.

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
Also,

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,870
I suspect that

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,080
he wants to steal my family's

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,990
defence map.

77
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,110
I know.

78
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,760
I was just going to

79
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,990
discuss this issue with you.

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,670
Master.

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
We have already found

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,430
the defence map's location.

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,870
We can send someone to tell

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,990
His Highness tonight.

85
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,470
Okay.

86
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
You can settle this matter

87
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,400
by yourself.

88
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes.

89
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,760
Do we have any mission these days

90
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,400
for Yun Han?

91
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,430
We should wait for a while.

92
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,230
Let me find out about the health

93
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,840
of Changlong Emperor

94
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,960
before we decide.

95
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,310
This is not the best time

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
for him to take action.

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,870
The capital is still a mess.

98
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,640
If we were to take action,

99
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,840
it must be a killing blow.

100
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,960
Find an opportunity

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,230
to remind him that he is

102
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,280
the son of a guilty official.

103
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,110
He mustn't forget his hatred

104
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,550
just because the crown prince
treats him well.

105
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,040
Yes.

106
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,040
Shi Qing.

107
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,200
Please

108
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,960
tell my father to let us out.

109
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Miss,

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
you should stay in the room.

111
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,760
It is really

112
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,720
not safe outside right now.

113
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
We will be obedient.

114
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,110
Miss,

115
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,640
it has nothing to do with

116
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,470
being obedient or not.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,760
Prince Consort has big plans.

118
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm afraid that you two will

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,790
be abandoned if you

120
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,430
become his weakness.

121
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,910
It is safer to just

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,790
stay inside.

123
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,960
Am I right?

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Shi Qing!

125
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,200
Open the door!

126
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,110
Princess Royal and Miss,

127
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,840
please remember to eat.

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,310
(He wants to steal the map.)

129
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
(What are you going to do about it?)

130
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,990
If you want the fish to take the bait,

131
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,350
you must first throw the bait.

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,790
So we must be heavily guarded

133
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,990
on the surface,

134
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,910
but secretly

135
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,110
show him some flaws.

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,110
Most importantly,

137
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,080
he has to think that the map

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
he's stealing is the real one.

139
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,990
You have tricked He Yuanting before.

140
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,790
He is bound to be suspicious.

141
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,040
I have an idea.

142
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
We should lure him in

143
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,350
and pretend to cover it up.

144
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,400
Your parents must

145
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,280
also be tricked.

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,550
Your Highness.

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,840
It should be very easy for

148
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,230
that tiger to figure out where the map

149
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,600
is with his ability.

150
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,350
However, He Yuanting still has to

151
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,430
be the one to take action.

152
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,960
So, all we have to do

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,430
is to keep an eye on He Yuanting

154
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,670
and wait for him to take the bait.

155
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,720
I will give you some men
of Blackmail Troop.

156
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,160
You must figure out a way

157
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,640
to find that person

158
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,350
in this battle.

159
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Also,

160
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,640
the hidden hand will

161
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,550
definitely figure out a way to

162
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,240
send a message to He Yuanting.

163
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,710
Stay at Hua Mansion

164
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,310
and replace the real message

165
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,550
with this fake one.

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,640
He Yuanting cares about the defence map.

167
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,280
Pei.

168
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,950
This person is skeptical.

169
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,950
We should do something

170
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,160
out of the ordinary.

171
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,640
The more ridiculous the bait seems,

172
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,430
the more likely he will take it.

173
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,160
(No way, Your Highness.)

174
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,700
(The map is on Hua Yingting's pants.)

175
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,950
There's something wrong with
the people of the State of Jin.

176
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,910
(I need to report to General A'Wa.)

177
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,710
(The three days that Hua Changkong)

178
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,280
(is sitting for the imperial exam
are the perfect chance.)

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,550
Yen Yuan asked about
perfect virtue. Confucius said,

180
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,590
"To subdue one's self and
return to propriety is perfect virtue.

181
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,430
If man can master that, then

182
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,040
perfect virtue will prevail the world."

183
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,670
You almost scared me to death!

184
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,070
You scared me!

185
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
Father, what are you doing here?

186
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,550
What are you doing here?

187
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,240
I came to hang the dumpling.

188
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,000
Why are you hanging it?

189
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,590
I read in a book that

190
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,910
the examinees in the capital

191
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,670
hang dumplings on a beam.

192
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,710
It symbolises that they will do well.

193
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,240
That's my girl.

194
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,430
Look here.

195
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,310
Have you decided where to hang it?

196
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,550
I'm thinking of hanging it on a lantern.

197
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,070
It'll be so high up.

198
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,670

199
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,190

Father, you can't be

202
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,980
thinking of stepping on me

203
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,550
to hang the dumplings.

204
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,160
You are my precious daughter.

205
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Why would I step on you?

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,040
Hold this.

207
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I will think of something.

208
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,430
Here. I'll hang it.

209
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,790

Why are you shushing?

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,160

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,640
Thank you, father.

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,590

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,790
Princess Hua hasn't even been

385
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,720
to Ceremonial Hall for
the past three days.

386
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,000
I have prepared a memorial

387
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,440
to be presented to the Emperor

388
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,240
after the imperial examination

389
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,870
to reprimand them for their actions.

390
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,310
Linzhou,

391
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,070
what do you think?

392
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,480
In my opinion, the matters of

393
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,680
Qinghan Steppe has been an issue

394
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,440
between the two states for a long time.

395
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,390
It's a difficult problem to solve.

396
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,720
Princess Hua and Crown Prince

397
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,870
are still young

398
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,550
and have little experience.

399
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
They have done

400
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
a decent job so far.

401
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,520
If they accepted

402
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,480
the marriage proposal

403
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
by the Second Prince
of Jinpo, I'm afraid

404
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,720
it would have long been resolved.

405
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,830
I have grown old.

406
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,580
(Virtues Are like Lingering Scent)

407
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,870
Pants.

408
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,960
Hua Yingting's pants.

409
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,310
One pair, two pairs,

410
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,440
so many pairs of pants.

411
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,110
Which pair has the map?

412
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,440
Take all of the pants!

413
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,790
Changkong

414
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,150
has finally finished the exam.

415
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,680
It's about time to

416
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
change back to my pants.

417
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,590
Who stole

418
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,040
all of my pants?

419
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,870
There're so many of you guys

420
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,070
yet you can't even keep my pants!

421
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,830
A bunch of useless people!

422
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
Don't worry, General Hua.

423
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,790
It may have been

424
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,550
the thieves in the capital.

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
Even if they only

426
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,870
stole a few pair of pants,

427
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,040
they must be severely punished!

428
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,920
How dare they steal

429
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,110
from the Hua family.

430
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,350
All I did was shout a little

431
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,350
in my courtyard.

432
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,830
How did Supreme Court

433
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,590
find out about what happened?

434
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,110
I'm so humiliated.

435
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,110
Why did they only

436
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,390
steal my pants?

437
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,350
(I see.)

438
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,520
What is so special

439
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,070
about father's pants?

440
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,720
I...

441
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,110
I also want to know.

442
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,390
Crown Prince has arrived.

443
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,590
Your Highness.

444
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,350
Your Highness.

445
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,960
I only lost some pants,

446
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,680
yet you came all the way here.

447
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,830
General Hua.

448
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,550
His Highness is

449
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,960
also in charge of the capital.

450
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,790
He needs to manage this situation.

451
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,000
My name has been tainted

452
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,440
all because of the pants!

453
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,680
Go on and talk!

454
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,590
I'm leaving!

455
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,350
Father.

456
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,200
Mother.

457
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,110
Song Guang.

458
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,760
You are a veteran.

459
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,790
Why are you so negligent,

460
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,720
lacking the basic vigilance?

461
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,150
You're so easily drugged.

462
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,680
Doesn't Hua Mansion have

463
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,720
a lot of traps and devices?

464
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,390
How were the thieves able to get in?

465
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,480
(Hua Mansion)

466
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,110
There's one thing I don't understand.

467
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,390
We should send the defence map

468
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,630
out of the capital

469
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,870
immediately since we

470
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,790
already have it.

471
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,480
We should wait for a while.

472
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,520
What if it's a fake one?

473
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,150
This...

474
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,680
Look.

475
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,040
Song Guang is captured.

476
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,000
It's proof that it is real.

477
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
How can it possibly be fake,

478
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,040
seriously?

479
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,720
What does it say?

480
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,110
The crown prince has sent an urgent

481
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,590
message to change the border defence.

482
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,100
(The defence map is stolen.
Change it immediately.)

483
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,070
The messenger has been secretly stopped

484
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,350
by Xie Linzhou's people.

485
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,960
Send the defence map back to

486
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,680
Jinpo before the crown prince finds out.

487
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,310
Yes.

488
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,000
Wait.

489
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,240
How many days will this take?

490
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,920
If they keep going day and night,

491
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
it will take five days.

492
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,590
His Highness will return in a while.

493
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,390
Please wait for a while, Princess Hua.

494
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,760
Do your work.

495
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,240
(I hope we can win this negotiation)

496
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,830
(and that those people from Jinpo)

497
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,000
(will return home disappointed.)

498
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,150
(I also wish that my brother will get)

499
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,790
(good grades in
the imperial examination.)

500
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,110
(I hope that the crown prince)

501
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,310
(and my family will be blessed.)

502
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,350
(I'll make a few more wishes.)

503
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,480
Come down!

504
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,960
Did I stand in the wrong place?

505
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,070
I was making wishes upon the rainbow

506
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,350
and you blocked it all.

507
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,280
Rainbow?

508
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,550
You're making wishes?

509
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,440
Hold on a second.

510
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,520
Everyone else makes wishes

511
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,790
upon stars at night.

512
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,920
What are you doing making wishes

513
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,070
upon a rainbow in broad daylight?

514
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,830
Mind your own business.

515
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,310
I'll mind my own business.

516
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,630
I'll mind my own business.

517
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,870
Apologise.

518
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,040
It's my problem.

519
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,040
No,

520
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,960
it's all my fault.

521
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,070
Don't apologise to me.

522
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,240
Apologise to that.

523
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,310
Rainbow,

524
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,680
it's my problem.

525
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,520
No, it's all my fault.

526
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,720
I was wrong.

527
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,070
Are you satisfied?

528
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,440
This is the crown prince.

529
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,310
He always looks so fierce

530
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,040
and kind of dumb.

531
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,870
Don't take his words too seriously.

532
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,920
She's right!

533
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,590
Rainbow!

534
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,390
Don't take me too seriously.

535
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,760
Don't take my words seriously.

536
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,440
Fafa likes you

537
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,790
even more now.

538
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,310
Of course,

539
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,280
its owner likes me so much.

540
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,200
Without a doubt, it'd like me even more.

541
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
By the way,

542
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,900
I heard that He Yuanting

543
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,480
already sent the fake map

544
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
to Jinpo.

545
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,760
Yes,

546
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,390
the fish has taken the bait,

547
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
but

548
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,150
my father suffered the most

549
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,280
this time.

550
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,390
I made my father

551
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,550
lose all his pants.

552
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,310
As his daughter,

553
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,520
I feel quite bad.

554
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,310
I will compensate General Hua.

555
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,280
Song has suffered though.

556
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

557
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,280
No need to be so polite with me.

558
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,590
It's my responsibility.

559
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,000
Liuli.

560
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,680
You did really well this time.

561
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,200
It's called hitting it off.

562
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,720
I will hold your hand through it all.

563
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,820
(Ceremonial Hall)

564
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,440
Officer Hua.

565
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,920
What do you have to say about

566
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,550
the Jinpo officials not arriving yet?

567
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,920
The Second Prince of Jinpo has arrived.

568
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,390
Finally.

569
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,790
The Second Prince of Jinpo,

570
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,200
you're on a high horse,

571
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,830
arriving so late

572
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,760
on the negotiation day.

573
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,760
Are we negotiating today?

574
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,870
I did not receive the notice.

575
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,310
I've sent someone to notify you.

576
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,350
Where are the other envoys?

577
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,150
Aren't they here?

578
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,960
Look.

579
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,520
I told you

580
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,070
we weren't notified.

581
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,310
Obviously, you guys...

582
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,280
Officer Zhang,

583
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,140
now that the main negotiator

584
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,420
for Jinpo has arrived,

585
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,920
we should get started

586
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,040
on the main topic right away.

587
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,920
Your Highness,

588
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,960
please.

589
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,000
No need to be in a hurry, Officer Hua.

590
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,440
The envoys of Jinpo haven't arrived.

591
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,960
Why are you so impatient?

592
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,680
I've sent people to

593
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,590
notify them already,

594
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,590
Your Highness.

595
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,440
Officer Hua.

596
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,870
The envoys of Jinpo aren't here.

597
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,280
They said they're free.

598
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,480
So they went to visit the nearby areas

599
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,200
to check out the local customs.

600
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,040
Also,

601
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,720
it will take them days to come back.

602
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,520
Well, that is quite unfortunate.

603
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,070
In the future, if you would like to

604
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,920
negotiate, please notify us beforehand,

605
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
Officer Hua.

606
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,870
Since we can't get anything done

607
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,280
today, you are all

608
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,280
dismissed.

609
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,550
We shall negotiate another day.

610
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,790
He Yuanting!

611
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,820
(Ceremonial Hall)

612
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,150
Please be

613
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,830
magnanimous today,

614
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,110
Princess Hua.

615
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,550
You should also come to terms

616
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,110
with reality, Your Highness.

617
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,280
Stop trying to stall for time

618
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,790
or there would be no tomorrow

619
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,590
after today.

620
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,920
Princess Hua, you are right.

621
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,040
According to what I see,

622
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,310
it may be hard to have

623
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,630
tomorrow after today.

624
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,150
There will be no tomorrow

625
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,150
for the State of Jin.

626
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,390
Why is the State of Jinpo so arrogant?

627
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,590
Princess Hua,

628
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,440
I have come today to personally

629
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,350
see you off as you go
on to fight for the state.

630
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,720
Thank you so much, Great Preceptor.

631
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,150
As the State of Jin's

632
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,520
great talent, you need
to assist Officer Hua.

633
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,680
Don't let other states

634
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,550
look down on us.

635
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,040
We will keep Great Preceptor's
words in mind.

636
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,070
The late Emperor once said,

637
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,720
"Use this Emperor's Whip to

638
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,000
whip those who act improperly.

639
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
You can hit incompetent rulers

640
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,110
and treacherous officials."

641
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,550
After he passed away,

642
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,830
the Emperor's Whip

643
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,830
was placed in my home.

644
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,110
This may not be a battlefield,

645
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,000
but it is another battlefield.

646
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,550
I am giving this to you.

647
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,630
May you have a triumphant return.

648
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,110
I shall not let you down.

649
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,760
Your Highness,

650
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,000
are...

651
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,310
are you not heading over?

652
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,680
Great Preceptor is boosting

653
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,040
Liuli's morale in front of everyone.

654
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,590
I do not need to be there

655
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,240
at this moment.

656
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,760
(Ceremonial Officer)
We talked about who should claim

657
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,680
the Qinghan steppe the last time

658
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,630
we postponed the negotiations.

659
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,830
Can Your Highness

660
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,480
sign the treaty now?

661
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,830
Jinpo

662
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,350
cannot agree to such a condition.

663
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,000
We would rather restart the war

664
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,040
than signing the treaty.

665
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,920
You have already lost.

666
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,110
What makes you think you can

667
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,480
restart the war?

668
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,350
The State of Jinpo has had great

669
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,040
achievements for hundreds of years.

670
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,350
This loss has affected us,

671
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,230
but I believe that

672
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,440
we still have it in us to fight.

673
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,960
Who cares about the hardship of war?

674
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,880
We will do our best to fight

675
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,520
to repay our state.

676
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,000
Your Highness,

677
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,150
there is nothing to negotiate

678
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,960
if you choose to go about your way

679
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,520
disregarding the people's needs.

680
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,630
(She must be extremely)

681
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,440
(anxious right now.)

682
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,320
(The defence map has been stolen and)

683
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,800
(the border situation is uncertain.)

684
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,270
(She should be wanting to end)

685
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,550
(this negotiation as soon as possible)

686
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,360
(I won't let her off that easily.)

687
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,070
(Hua Liuli.)

688
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,190
(You never thought that you)

689
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,040
(would lose this time, did you?)

690
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,710
Officer Hua,

691
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,070
you fooled me once

692
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,880
and I trick you once.

693
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,670
We're even.

694
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,710
The State of Jin owes nothing

695
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,070
to the State of Jinpo.

696
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,070
I owe you something.

697
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm sorry to you.

698
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
It's just like how I finally understood

699
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,110
why you treated me like that then.

700
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,840
I hope that you will

701
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,110
understand me this time around.

702
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
(We should be able)

703
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,440
(to end this)

704
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,750
(prolonged torment today.)

705
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,740
(Pursue Virtue and Righteousness)

706
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,840
Battle report from the frontier is here.

707
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,040
Officer Hua, the frontier report.

708
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,840
Officer Hua, who do you think

709
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,920
won?

710
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,550
Of course it'd be the State of Jin.

711
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,710
We won.

712
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,550
Battle report.

713
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,070
Jinpo led 3,000 soldiers

714
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,590
on a night attack in Qinghai Prefecture.

715
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,630
Hua Jingyi, the eldest
son of the Hua family,

716
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,440
led a troop that wiped out half

717
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,150
of the enemy, leaving a small group

718
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,270
who escaped back to Jinpo.

719
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,710
The State of Jin won.

720
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,630
We won!

721
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,230
That is so great!

722
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,710
We won!

723
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,590
Look, we won.

724
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,920
Your Highness.

725
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,920
Even though the State of Jin promotes

726
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,590
peace between the two states,

727
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,150
it does not mean that

728
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,590
we are afraid of fighting wars.

729
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,670
Don't you forget

730
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,150
why you came here.

731
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,000
The State of Jin seized

732
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,670
total victory in the war at year end.

733
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,440
The State of Jin would still have won

734
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,360
regardless of what happened between us.

735
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,800
This battle report

736
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,400
is the best proof of that.

737
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,800
Take a look.

738
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,820
(Battle Report)

739
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,440
Your Highness.

740
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,880
Will you sign

741
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,320
the treaty or not?

742
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,400
I'm sure you are able to come

743
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,000
to a decision, Your Highness.

744
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,580
(Peace Treaty)

745
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,900
(Ceremonial Hall)

746
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:07,860
(Pursue Virtues and Righteousness)

747
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,190
Very good.

748
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,750
Yes.

749
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,880
Master.

750
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,520
Master.

751
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,000
Master.

752
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
How did it go?

753
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,190
Master,

754
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,920
we have succeeded!

755
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,960
We've succeeded.

756
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
That's great.

757
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,800
All I wanted my entire life

758
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,920
was for the world

759
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,590
to be at peace!

760
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,000
- Master!
- Master!

761
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,800
Master!

762
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,070
Get an imperial physician!

763
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,230
(Ceremonial Hall)
Get an imperial physician!

764
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,940
Master!

765
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,630
Get an imperial physician!

766
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,630
Hua Liuli!

767
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,320
I want to ask you.

768
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,150
Where did I

769
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,440
go wrong

770
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,440
this time?

771
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,840
What do you think?

772
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,960
Hua Liuli.

773
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,190
Why do you fool me again and again?

774
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,000
Why?

775
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,400
Who wanted the marriage alliance?

776
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,630
Who wanted to live in my home?

777
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,670
Who was it

778
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
that schemed to steal

779
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,880
the defence map from my parents?

780
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,320
We finally were able to stop

781
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,630
the battle on the borders,

782
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,150
but you still wouldn't give up.

783
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,520
He Yuanting,

784
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,630
the defence map that you stole

785
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,520
was a fake one.

786
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,400
We'd already sent a message to

787
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Qinghan Prefecture to warn my brother.

788
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,630
Of course you would lose, attacking

789
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,590
us using the fake defence map.

790
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,880
This war

791
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,400
was avoidable, but you

792
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,480
still wouldn't turn back.

793
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,960
That's why it ended like this.

794
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,260
(Pretentious Hour)

795
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,230
Why haven't the crown prince

796
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,840
and Miss come out yet?

797
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,520
It's too cold,

798
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,960
isn't it, Junior Secretary Pei?

799
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,070
Yuan Wei.

800
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,070
Thank you so much

801
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,840
for reminding me,

802
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
I almost forgot.

803
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,230
Help me to hold the umbrella.

804
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,400
Okay.

805
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,590
You don't have to do that.

806
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,590
Excuse me.

807
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,110
This persimmon tree is

808
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,840
precious to His Highness.

809
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,230
We can't let it freeze.

810
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,520
Pei Jihuai!

811
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,270
Hmph!

812
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,920
