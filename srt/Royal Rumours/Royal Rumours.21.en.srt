17
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,820
(Ceremonial Hall)

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,960
Today,

19
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,000
you've been through a lot.

20
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,550
It's been a tough day for you.

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,600
We had expected the outcome,

22
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,800
but somehow,

23
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,390
it was still tough.

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Indeed.

25
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,040
The Hua family is really outstanding

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,270
for defending the State of Jin

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,760
in battles.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,830
Right now,

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,240
in this battle of wits,

30
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,710
it is still the Hua family that

31
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,990
contributed the most.

32
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,520
By the way,

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,430
Grand Preceptor Du presented

34
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,040
Emperor's Whip to me.

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,040
It is said to have been bestowed

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,590
by the late Emperor.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,080
I've heard that since
the late Emperor's times,

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,590
Grand Preceptor Du has been

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,920
bringing Emperor's Whip
to the imperial court.

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,320
He would teach

41
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,640
corrupted officials

42
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,480
a tough lesson.

43
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,360
Now that

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,390
he has presented it to you,

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,710
it means that he backs you up

46
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,960
and has confidence in you.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,430
I know.

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,390
I'm sure he wants the best
for the State of Jin.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,320
We've finally won.

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,270
The imperial examination
results are released!

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,990
The imperial examination
results are released!

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,550
I can't see anything.

53
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,200
Go!

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,990
I'm not going.

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,040
It's so crowded.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,960
Why is it so crowded?

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
What shall we do?

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,960
(Noticeboard)
How shall we get there?

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,870
I can't see it.

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,870
Brother.

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,830
(Examination Hall)
Changkong.

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,320
Changkong.

63
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,110
Man up!

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,390
Go and check it!

65
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,270
No!

66
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,760
Liuli,

67
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,920
let's figure out a way.

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,640
Goodness me!

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,760
It seems we have to go to extremes.

70
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,270
The crown prince is here!

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,990
The crown prince is here!

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
That was smart of you!

73
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,830
That was really smart of you!

74
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,200
Hurry up!

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,710
Let's go! Hurry up!

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,430
Let's check it!

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,040
(Noticeboard)
Father.

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,320
Come here.

79
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,550
Come and check it!

80
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,710
Where is your name?

81
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,020
(The First Place)

82
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,500
(Hua Changkong)

83
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,240
There!

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,710
There!

85
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,150
Changkong has got the first place!

86
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,800
Where is it?

87
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,360
The best scholar.

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,320
The first place!

89
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,870
You've got the first place, Changkong!

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,550
You're the best scholar!

91
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,320
My lad!

92
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,390
You've got the first place!

93
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:09,870
I've got the first place.

94
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,110
You've made it!

95
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,670
I've made it!

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,270
Excellent, brother!

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,110
I've made it!

98
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,320
I've made it!

99
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,760
(Examination Hall)
You're the Hua family's pride and joy!

100
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,440
(Examination Hall)
I've made it, mother!

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,680
(Examination Hall)
Mother, I've made it!

102
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,760
Xiuying, you should go.

103
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,390
You should go.

104
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,390
Finish the medicine

105
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,680
and I shall go.

106
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,960
Go now.

107
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,030
I'll take care of myself.

108
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,910
Go. Hurry up.

109
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,270
What's the feast about?

110
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,470
You've splurged so much on it.

111
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,590
We're obviously celebrating

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,080
the successful negotiations

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,830
and the achievement of
the Hua family's second son.

114
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,710
Well,

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,760
isn't this Hua Liuli's personal matter?

116
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,960
Why are you and Prince Ying

117
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,120
organising the feast?

118
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,760
Aren't the matters worth celebrating?

119
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,000
Yao Wenyin,

120
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,440
don't be narrow-minded, okay?

121
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,440
Okay.

122
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,880
Bottoms up!

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
(Stupid guy.)

124
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,830
(The only thing he cares about)

125
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,910
(is drinking.)

126
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,830
What's wrong?

127
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,710
Why are you suddenly upset?

128
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,760
Congratulations!

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Congratulations, Changkong,
on being the best scholar!

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,960
Thank you!

131
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,680
Guys, this way, please.

132
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,830
What's wrong?

133
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,710
Your Highness,

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,560
why didn't you accompany Princess Hua?

135
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
The honour is hers.

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,350
She deserves the people's

137
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,470
respect and admiration.

138
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,960
If I'm there,

139
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,880
they won't dare to show their respect.

140
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,270
Your Highness, you've become

141
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,910
considerate towards

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
other people.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,350
I'm only considerate towards her.

144
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,790
I can smell jealousy.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Didn't you say

146
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,350
jealousy could prove one's feelings

147
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,910
for another person?

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,680
That's right.

149
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,960
Drink more and be more jealous.

150
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,910
I...

151
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,320
I think you've been increasingly

152
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,030
nosy when it comes to Hua Liuli.

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Nonsense.

154
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,000
Eat.

155
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,710
(Where is Xiuying?)

156
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,120
I...

157
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,790
Xiuying.

158
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,680
Liuli,

159
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,270
why did you leave the feast?

160
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,680
It was too boring.

161
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,880
I needed some fresh air.

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,680
Xiuying, look.

163
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,640
The stars are beautiful.

164
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,590
Really?

165
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,590
Where

166
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,120
are the stars?

167
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,560
Liuli,

168
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,440
are we looking

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,760
at the same sky?

170
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,470
Xiuying,

171
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,230
do you want

172
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,680
to view the sky more clearly?

173
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,710
What do you mean?

174
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,390
Follow me.

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,270
Look, Xiuying.

176
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,760
Admiring the view on the rooftop

177
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,960
can cheer one up.

178
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,910
Let's go.

179
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,440
This is improper for the well-mannered.

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Besides,

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,030
it's really high.

182
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,320
It's really improper.

183
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,320
Don't worry.

184
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,560
There's no one else here.

185
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,350
Besides,

186
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,760
I'll hold the ladder in place.

187
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll ensure your safety.

188
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,350
Once you're up there,

189
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,760
I'll climb up.

190
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,000
Liuli,

191
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,030
you're still weak.

192
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,710
Don't exert yourself.

193
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,830
Don't worry.

194
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,470
Let me help you.

195
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,590
The rooftop offers

196
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,630
a panoramic view.

197
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,230
Give it a try.

198
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,680
Let's go.

199
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,870
Hold it tightly.

200
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
Step up on your right foot.

201
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,470
Stand firmly.

202
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,040
That's right.

203
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,110
You can do it.

204
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,680
Here.

205
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Watch out.

206
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,630
Don't be afraid, Xiuying.

207
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,160
Look.

208
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,750
Those are the stars, right?

209
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,400
If you think they are,

210
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,470
they are.

211
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
Liuli,

212
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,960
sometimes,

213
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,320
I envy you.

214
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,510
I was weak when I was little.

215
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,560
My brothers would secretly carry me

216
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,920
to the rooftop

217
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,590
just to see the world
beyond the courtyard.

218
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,160
Then,

219
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,470
I learnt to climb the wall.

220
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,470
Whenever my family

221
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,830
fought in a battle,

222
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,830
I would sit on the rooftop

223
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,800
or stand on the city wall
to wait for them.

224
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,160
Watch out.

225
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,470
Miss.

226
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,990
Miss, come down.

227
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
Watch out, Miss.

228
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,870
(Qinghan Prefecture)

229
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,800
(Qinghan Prefecture)
Watch out.

230
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,750
(Qinghan Prefecture)
Come down, please.

231
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,230
Watch out.

232
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,470
When I heard the horses,

233
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,680
I knew

234
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,280
they returned in triumph.

235
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,750
Everyone behaves the same way

236
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,590
towards his or her family.

237
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,320
We miss our families and
feel reluctant to leave them.

238
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,870
This is human nature.

239
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,830
Liuli,

240
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,590
thanks for comforting me.

241
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,230
Xiuying,

242
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,960
you're welcome.

243
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,680
I just hope that you'll cry

244
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,960
and laugh

245
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
whenever you want.

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,510
Strong people express themselves well.

247
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,230
Weak people wear their
hearts on their sleeves.

248
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,200
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve.

249
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,830
I understand.

250
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,560
Great-grandfather,

251
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,990
I want to accompany you forever.

252
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,560
I know that

253
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,830
you're filial.

254
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,200
For hundreds of years,

255
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,350
the State of Jin experienced
lots of misery.

256
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,830
People were oppressed and robbed.

257
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,990
After all the hardship,

258
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,990
we've achieved prosperity.

259
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,510
You

260
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,710
should not be confined here.

261
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,920
Explore the world outside.

262
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,350
Explore it on my behalf.

263
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,350
From now on,

264
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,750
I'll be my great-grandfather's explorer.

265
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,630
I want to observe more

266
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,040
for him

267
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,200
and tell him

268
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,200
how well the State of Jin is

269
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,710
and how well the princes
are getting along.

270
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,990
My great-grandfather will
be very happy to hear that.

271
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,710
Your Highness.

272
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,870
Qi and Ba.

273
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,710
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

274
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,630
Send two imperial physicians

275
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,110
to Grand Preceptor Mansion tomorrow.

276
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,510
Provide him

277
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,560
with any kind of effective medicine.

278
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,750
Yes, Your Highness.

279
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,400
If there is no suitable medicine

280
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,280
in Imperial Academy of Medicine,

281
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,920
they should come to see me.

282
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,590
Yes, Your Highness.

283
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,630
Liuli,

284
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,510
I'm sorry for being overwhelmed.

285
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
Why are you apologising?

286
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,750
We are flesh and blood.

287
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Like I said, cry when you want to.

288
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,080
Smile when you want to.

289
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,230
Then you will be happy.

290
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,160
It's a shame that

291
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
as time goes by,

292
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,470
sometimes, we

293
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
can't live the life we want.

294
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,230
Liuli,

295
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,160
you're more insightful than me.

296
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,040
No, I'm not.

297
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,750
We're good

298
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,870
at perceiving things that

299
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,280
happen to other people,

300
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,350
but if we were in their situation,

301
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
we might face a dilemma.

302
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,800
No one

303
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,320
can always live without doubt.

304
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,440
Wait a minute.

305
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,680
I think I heard

306
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,870
Hua Liuli's voice.

307
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,590
Are you sure?

308
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,750
Yes.

309
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,040
Hey.

310
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,990
Why did she climb

311
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
up the roof?

312
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,710
Could she be having

313
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,200
a secret rendezvous with someone?

314
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
However, the crown prince

315
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,680
was in the room just now.

316
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,470
I want to tip him off.

317
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,590
Then I shall do whatever I want,

318
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,510
like what you said, Liuli.

319
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,680
Otherwise,

320
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,110
I may regret it.

321
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,280
The person she's
rendezvousing with is

322
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,800
- Xiuying?
- Xiuying?

323
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,560
I'll go up to find out.

324
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,590
Watch out.

325
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,590
I'm fine.

326
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,920
However, you can't tell Jiamin

327
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,590
that I'm so timid.

328
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,630
Otherwise,

329
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
she will laugh at me.

330
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,560
Hua Liuli,

331
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,750
why did you bring

332
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
my cousin here?

333
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,470
- Watch out.
- Jiamin?

334
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,710
Come here.

335
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,830
Watch out.

336
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,230
Help me.

337
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,920
Be careful.

338
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,990
Mind your step.

339
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,590
Wenyin, you're here, too.

340
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:10,710
Be careful.

341
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,560
Yes.

342
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,230
Xiuying,

343
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,440
why did you come up here

344
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,440
with Hua Liuli?

345
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,200
I did it of my own accord.

346
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,400
Also, Jiamin,

347
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,350
it's late now.

348
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,080
Lower your voice.

349
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,830
Don't end up scaring Princess Fushou.

350
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,350
Also,

351
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,680
you're a lady.

352
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,870
You should talk calmly.

353
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,960
There you go.

354
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,160
We've got another brainwashed person.

355
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Since we're all here,

356
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,230
let's watch the stars together.

357
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,740
(Qunying Eatery)

358
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,560
Yuanhao,

359
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,110
what brought you here?

360
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,680
I'm looking for Princess Jiamin.

361
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Princess Jiamin?

362
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,750
Prince Ying,

363
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,870
Princess Jiamin and Ms. Yao

364
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,440
are chatting on the rooftop.

365
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,270
What are they doing on the rooftop?

366
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,440
I'll find out.

367
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,400
Yuanhao,

368
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,470
maybe they are having

369
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,840
a heart-to-heart talk.

370
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,840
Let's not

371
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,160
disturb them.

372
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,030
You're right.

373
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,880
Since they are still chatting

374
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,360
on the rooftop,

375
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,990
I'll return first.

376
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,710
Okay.

377
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,360
Good night.

378
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,030
Oh right,

379
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,400
here.

380
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,990
Jiamin,

381
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,510
you copied me.

382
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,960
Do you want it?
Return it if you don't.

383
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,310
I do!

384
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,510
However,

385
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,070
don't you want to keep one

386
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,960
for Prince Ying?

387
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,310
No, you say...

388
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
Calm down.

389
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,510
You have no idea.

390
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,600
Prince Ying only cared about drinking

391
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,120
and ended up neglecting her.

392
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,160
Why are you saying this?

393
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,030
So you were ignored.

394
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,920
You're lonely.

395
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,400
What are you saying?

396
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,360
Am I wrong?

397
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't you

398
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,750
and Prince Ying

399
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,840
love each other

400
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,990
and want to get married?

401
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,030
Is it that obvious?

402
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,510
- It is obvious!
- It is obvious!

403
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,880
Stop it!

404
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,600
What about you?

405
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,600
You've been flirting

406
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,510
with the crown prince.

407
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,640
You always give each other the eye.

408
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
Jiamin!

409
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,230
Stop that.

410
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,310
Have you been dating the crown prince?

411
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
Xiuying, are you serious?

412
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,750
Didn't you know?

413
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,510
What about you, Xiuying?

414
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,070
Is there anyone that

415
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,710
you like?

416
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,710
Look at her expression!

417
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,640
Who is he?

418
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,840
Who is he?

419
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,310
Tell us!

420
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,680
Wenyin,

421
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,680
Wenyin,

422
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,600
what about you?

423
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,160
Who is it?

424
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,990
Right.

425
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,750
All of you are in love

426
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
except me.

427
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,230
You've never found me a match.

428
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,440
Let me think.

429
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,640
Qi, Ba,

430
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,360
Jingua or Yingua?

431
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,160
Feel free to choose one.

432
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,270
No!

433
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,440
I want someone who is

434
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,840
like a character in a novella.

435
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,880
He must be talented

436
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,070
and handsome.

437
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,550
He must be like
a character in a novella?

438
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,600
Look! It's a shooting star!

439
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,160
Make a wish!

440
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,200
Make a wish!

441
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,600
Are you okay, Xiuying?

442
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,400
I'm okay.

443
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,790
Crown Prince.

444
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,440
Go and talk to him.

445
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,440
We'll return first.

446
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,310
Go.

447
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,230
Let's go.

448
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,140
(Qunying Eatery)

449
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,880
Here I am.

450
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,510
Are you tired?

451
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,310
Yes.

452
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,600
I think

453
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
you're not so tired today.

454
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,160
You had time

455
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,510
comforting other girls.

456
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,550
I didn't.

457
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,160
I noticed how sad

458
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,270
Xiuying was.

459
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,360
Then,

460
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,310
Jiamin

461
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,790
and Wenyin joined us.

462
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,600
So I cheered them up, too.

463
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,790
However, you didn't really

464
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,440
talk to me tonight.

465
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,640
Let me talk to you now.

466
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,960
I have a lot to tell you.

467
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,880
Look.

468
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,470
You're so good at cheering people up.

469
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,550
By the way,

470
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,160
I'll take you somewhere tomorrow.

471
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,680
You're taking me

472
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,030
to Du Mansion.

473
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,710
Will it be appropriate?

474
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,120
Grand Preceptor Du has
been through two dynasties.

475
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,230
Despite his

476
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,920
fussy attitude towards me

477
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,070
and stubbornness,

478
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,470
he has always been

479
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,600
loyal to the State of Jin.

480
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
He's badly ill.

481
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,360
He must be thinking

482
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,310
when I will get married.

483
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,990
Why is he so concerned

484
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,160
about your marriage?

485
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,710
Maybe it's because

486
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,310
I'm next in line to the throne.

487
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,440
If he knows I'm chosen

488
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,400
by the future emperor,

489
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,440
will he be angry?

490
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,600
Hasn't he presented

491
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Emperor's Whip to you?

492
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,200
That's different.

493
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,030
He gave me Emperor's Whip

494
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,600
to support me in serving the state.

495
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,230
However,

496
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,750
if he knows that

497
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,120
I've won the heir's heart,

498
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,990
won't he scold us?

499
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,310
Liuli,

500
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm not hiding this anymore.

501
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,990
I don't want him to depart
this life without knowing about us.

502
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,580
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

503
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,310
Miss.

504
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,510
The crown prince and Princess Fushou

505
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,710
have come to visit Grand Preceptor.

506
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,200
Grand Preceptor.

507
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,230
Greetings, Your Highness.

508
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,510
I've heard that

509
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,880
it's quite foggy today.

510
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Was the journey

511
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,510
okay?

512
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,200
It was good.

513
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,960
Your Highness,

514
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,120
ruling the state is like
walking through the fog.

515
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,470
If you know what you want,

516
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,160
you'll know how to
overcome the obstacles.

517
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,790
If you're doubtful,

518
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,840
you'll hit a snag.

519
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,920
My days

520
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,070
are numbered.

521
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,680
I won't be able

522
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,230
to marvel at

523
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,750
the beautiful State of Jin.

524
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,880
I hope you'll protect
the interests of the civilians

525
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,750
and rule the state virtuously.

526
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,230
Grand Preceptor,

527
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,270
please take good care of yourself.

528
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,790
I know that

529
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,600
you've been concerned
about the State of Jin.

530
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,030
If I've done anything wrong,

531
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,310
please point it out.

532
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,680
Grand Preceptor,

533
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,360
I know that

534
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,120
you don't like me.

535
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,550
Princess Hua,

536
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,920
I used to be fussy

537
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,550
by challenging you.

538
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,030
In fact,

539
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,310
you've done very well

540
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,120
like His Highness.

541
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,710
I feel happy

542
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,120
that His Highness

543
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,790
is assisted

544
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,600
by you.

545
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,400
In the future,

546
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,120
the State of Jin will be
your huge responsibility.

547
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,070
Grand Preceptor,

548
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,230
emissaries from
different states are here.

549
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,640
The capital is very busy.

550
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,640
You can't visit it

551
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,840
because of your illness.

552
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,960
So, I had someone draw

553
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,160
the prosperous scene.

554
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,510
The State of Jin is thriving.

555
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,960
There are interstate meetings.

556
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
Emissaries and merchants

557
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,070
have been visiting us.

558
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,990
Jinque Street

559
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,360
is very busy.

Greetings, Master Du.

568
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,680
Your Majesty.

569
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,880
Emperor's Whip was given
to me by the late Emperor.

570
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,750
You can use it to

571
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,470
punish any corrupted official

572
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,990
and incapable emperor.

573
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,840
Your Majesty,

574
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,640
by the power of Emperor's Whip,

575
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,440
may I ask you

576
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,230
what the state means to you?

577
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,200
It refers to all the civilians

578
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,550
of every young

579
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
and old generation

580
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,710
living in every beautiful corner

581
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,920
of the State of Jin.

582
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,740
♪With all the passion♪

583
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,470
Great!

584
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,120
Great!

585
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,510
I was wrong.

586
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Your Highness,

587
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,710
you are a capable crown prince.

588
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,750
My only hope

589
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,990
is that

590
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,960
the State of Jin

591
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,680
will always be a prosperous

592
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,640
and developed state.

593
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,880
Would you

594
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,990
promise me?

595
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,310
Woud you, Your Highness?

596
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,960
Of course.

597
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,790
Your Highness.

598
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,840
General A'Wa,

599
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,200
when you led the soldiers

600
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,840
to ambush Huzhou,

601
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,990
how many civilians
and craftsmen

602
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,840
did you kidnap?

603
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,230
I think there were

604
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,120
over 10,000 of them.

605
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,160
The State of Jin has fertile lands.

606
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,600
The civilians living there

607
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
are determined.

608
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,960
They are forgiving

609
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,070
and vindictive at the same time.

610
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,750
50 years ago, a drought
struck the State of Jin.

611
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,960
Gaochang state contributed food.

612
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,400
Political chaos happened
in Gaochang 20 years ago.

613
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,360
The State of Jin helped
to stabilise Gaochang

614
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,120
and supplied farming equipment,

615
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,120
craftsmen and artisans.

616
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,230
In recent years,

617
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,400
have you ever heard that

618
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,990
the State of Jin has wronged Gaochang?

619
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,470
The people of Jin

620
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,840
are vindictive,

621
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,360
but are generous, too.

622
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,750
Your Highness,

623
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,600
why are you talking

624
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,200
about the people of Jin?

625
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm only expressing

626
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,440
my feelings about the State of Jin.

627
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,550
Your Highness,

628
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,360
are you okay?

629
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,840
Yes.

630
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,440
Why were we

631
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,960
born into different states?

632
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,270
Father,

633
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,790
I went to see Grand Preceptor Du

634
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,360
with the crown prince today.

635
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,750
I'm afraid that his days are numbered.

636
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,160
I've heard so.

637
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,400
I was thinking of

638
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,070
visiting him as soon as possible.

639
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,160
Father,

640
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,920
why do people say

641
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,920
that you always clash
with Grand Preceptor Du?

642
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,880
You got the wrong idea.

643
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,710
It happened for the sake

644
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,990
of the State of Jin.

645
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,470
Do you remember the time

646
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,360
when we first met

647
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,880
Grand Preceptor Du?

648
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,510
Now that you've mentioned it,

649
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,680
I've started to recall it.

650
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,600
When he and I first met,

651
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,030
we didn't get along

652
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,990
because of different political views.

653
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,120
We had many arguments

654
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,360
in the imperial court meetings.

655
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,920
I think

656
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,880
that was during
the late Emperor's reign.

657
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,230
However, Grand Preceptor Du

658
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,880
has done a lot for the civilians.

659
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,640
I respect him

660
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,470
a lot.

661
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,400
What happened?

662
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,310
You look unhappy.

663
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,790
Would you even keep anything from me?

664
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,550
Miss, actually

665
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,120
I've indeed been keeping

666
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,160
something from you for a long time.

667
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,840
The problem with General Hua's pants

668
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,990
was caused by Junior Secretary Pei.

669
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,990
I really don't understand.

670
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,160
He said we're friends,

671
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,160
but he cheated me.

672
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,360
In fact,

673
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,680
I had guessed correctly

674
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,680
that Pei Jihuai

675
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,880
had changed my father's pants.

676
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,230
Really?

677
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,470
It was an easy job

678
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,510
to change my father's pants.

679
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,230
Even I could do that.

680
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,600
Why did the crown prince

681
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,030
ask Junior Secretary Pei to do that?

682
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,310
That's because

683
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,470
even the crown prince knew

684
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,920
you liked Junior Secretary Pei.

685
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,470
However, I'm just

686
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,270
a servant.

687
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,030
He's an important aide
to the crown prince.

688
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,880
He's Junior Secretary of Supreme Court.

689
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,750
What are you talking about?

690
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,270
You're my little sister.

691
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,960
You're a female general

692
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,310
with the title of a captain.

693
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,120
In Qinghan Prefecture,

694
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
you fought in a battle.

695
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,510
You deserve respect.

696
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,600
Really?

697
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,160
Whether the feelings are mutual,

698
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,880
it's easy to find out.

699
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,840
Just ask him.

700
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,400
If he likes you,

701
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,680
you must take action

702
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,960
to be with him.

703
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,440
If he doesn't like you,

704
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,400
you should also stop

705
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
feeling unhappy.

706
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,990
You're right, Miss.

707
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,120
If I see him next time,

708
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,990
I'll ask him.

709
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Good.

710
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,270
Okay. Let's go.

711
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,440
Is my second brother still studying

712
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,640
after getting the first place?

713
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,880
We should drag him out.

714
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,510
Let's go.

715
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,710
The weather is hot and dry.

716
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,230
Watch out for a fire.

717
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,030
The weather is hot and dry.

718
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,160
Watch out for a fire.

719
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,030
(The crown prince even asked me)

720
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,310
(to sneak some medicine to you.)

721
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,750
(Yun Han,)

722
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,990
(don't)

723
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,070
(disappoint us.)

724
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,620
(Hua Mansion)

725
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,470
Princess Hua,

726
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,200
may I

727
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,270
have a word with you?

728
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,120
Princess Hua,

729
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
I've never wanted any battle.

730
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,310
Since I was a child, I don't care

731
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,310
which party

732
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,880
initiated the battle.

733
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,070
Both states have long been fighting.

734
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,400
So, there must be a winner.

735
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,790
If Jinpo wins,

736
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,230
what will happen to the State of Jin?

737
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,400
There will be political
chaos and instability.

738
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,200
You seem to understand
your state's strategy

739
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,510
very well.

740
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,840
What do you think

741
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,270
about the terms now?

742
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,230
Are they still unacceptable?

743
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,200
Yes, they are.

744
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,680
It seems what I told you

745
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,920
that day did not work at all.

746
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,840
Princess Hua,

747
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,200
I remember

748
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,230
when I first saw you,

749
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,680
you appeared amidst the sandy place.

750
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,200
You looked attractive...

751
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,840
Yes.

752
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,960
He Yuanting,

753
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,030
why are you talking

754
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,070
about the past?

755
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,280
After Jinpo's loss,

756
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,320
I was confined in seclusion.

757
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,880
I felt outraged.

758
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,630
I kept thinking about

759
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,990
what you had told me.

760
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,990
I was also thinking whether

761
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,030
a battle must happen

762
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,510
between the two states

763
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,510
to solve the issues.

764
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,280
The civilians want

765
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,400
a peaceful life.

766
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,960
In a vast state,

767
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,630
is it about the lands

768
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,990
or the civilians?

769
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,960
Some just want

770
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,280
to use their power

771
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,920
to achieve their ambition.

772
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,760
You're right.

773
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,150
I'm here

774
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,670
not to advocate

775
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,920
any battle.

776
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,920
Instead, I'm here to fight

777
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,920
for Jinpo.

778
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,760
However, you have not succeeded.

779
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,880
I just want to ask you a question.

780
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,580
(Hua Hao Yue Yuan)
[*Love blossoms.]

781
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,960
After I return to Jinpo,

782
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,360
will you be willing to help me?

783
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,280
I promise you that

784
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,320
both states will be on
friendly terms forever.

785
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,590
There will never be another battle.

786
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,470
You're

787
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,720
so cunning that

788
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,240
I can no longer trust you.

789
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
If you agree to it,

790
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,320
I'll tell you a secret

791
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,070
that has been hidden

792
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,960
in the State of Jin for years.

793
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,720
Okay.

794
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,670
I promise you.

795
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,400
You should remember

796
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,880
the Battle of Yuncang Ridge
that happened ten years ago.

797
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,880
Both states saw losses and disasters.

798
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,920
Your parents almost died there.

799
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,190
A'Wa's father

800
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,110
died in the battle.

801
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,070
Someone in the State of Jin
is overly ambitious.

802
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,550
He wants to benefit from our fights.

803
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,720
Did you find out the details?

804
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,470
By the time I met you

805
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,470
in the woods that day,

806
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,590
I had long been in the capital

807
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,510
to secretly investigate it.

808
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,880
The official responsible for

809
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,400
combat rations at the time, Lian Yue,

810
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,470
has become

811
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,920
Censorate Zhu

812
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,360
of the State of Jin.

813
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,590
(It's him!)

814
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,510
(However, I can't fully
trust He Yuanting.)

815
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,590
(I still need to)

816
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,720
(verify it.)

817
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,240
Thank you.

818
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,800
Your Highness,

819
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,880
why did you reveal so much?

820
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,360
It's because no one is

821
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,630
Jinpo's ally.

822
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,920
If they harm each other,

823
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,800
we'll have a chance to strike.

824
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,070
She's too smart.

825
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,990
So instead of lying to her,

826
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
why don't we tell her some truth?

827
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,240
Princess Hua.

828
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,070
Where is His Highness?

829
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,920
I've just heard that

830
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,360
His Majesty isn't feeling well.

831
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,320
So His Highness

832
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,670
quickly returned to the palace.

833
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,240
Before he left, he instructed me

834
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,110
to tell you

835
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,360
he's in Eastern Palace,

836
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,800
in case of an emergency.

837
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,670
It's all right.

838
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,240
I shall wait for him here.

839
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,760
Your Highness,

840
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,070
don't cry.

841
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,800
His Majesty will be fine.

842
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,360
Stop crying.

843
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm fine.

844
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,150
If you leave me alone,

845
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,110
I may have a few more days to live.

846
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,110
You may return.

847
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,670
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

848
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,190
Hold on.

849
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,760
Don't tell anyone

850
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,510
what happened today.

851
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,630
Is that understood?

852
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

853
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,070
Father.

854
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,360
Your Highness.

855
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,360
Father,

856
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,190
are you okay?

857
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,470
Yes.

858
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
Consort Xian just

859
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,550
fell while walking.

860
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,150
You lunged forward

861
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,280
to hold her.

862
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,920
She's still young.

863
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,400
However, you've been unwell.

864
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,720
How could you impulsively do that?

865
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,760
I was worried that she'd get hurt.

866
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,880
Besides, Consort Xian is worried
that Grand Preceptor Du

867
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,800
will depart this life soon.

868
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,320
She's worried that

869
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,550
I'll lose all the support I have.

870
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,760
So,

871
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,510
she's been anxious lately.

872
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,800
She's your wife,

873
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,960
yet

874
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,760
she doesn't understand you at all.

875
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,990
Father,

876
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,470
I have a question that

877
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,760
I've always wanted to ask you.

878
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,070
Go ahead.

879
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,920
As I observe,

880
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,030
Consort Xian is the one that

881
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,400
you truly care about.

882
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,760
You protect her. You pamper her.

883
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,840
You dote on her

884
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,110
despite all her

885
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,510
obvious mistakes.

886
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,280
I never understood why.

887
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,240
Since Liuli came into my life,

888
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,280
I've started to realise that

889
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,840
without love,

890
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,630
you wouldn't have done

891
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,920
so much for her.

892
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,070
However,

893
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,800
what about my mother?

894
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,800
Ten years ago,

895
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,320
my Empress conspired with
her relatives to commit treason.

896
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,190
Your mother died of an illness

897
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,280
suddenly at the time.

898
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,440
I was always sceptical of why she died.

899
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,240
However, I couldn't find any proof.

900
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,670
Although the chaos was finally quashed,

901
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,440
I've always felt guilty

902
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,880
towards her.

903
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,190
You've answered my question.

904
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,590
Father,

905
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,990
rest well.

906
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,360
Yuansu,

907
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,030
here.

908
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,630
I've brought you

909
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,030
something nice.

910
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,630
Su'er.

911
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,920
Father.

912
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
Study hard.

913
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,240
I love you most dearly.

914
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,720
Do you like it?

915
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,150
Yes.

916
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,590
Good boy.

917
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,760
Let me read with you.

918
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,360
Your Highness,

919
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,990
you've always

920
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,670
had a place

921
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,760
in His Majesty's heart.

922
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,990
Besides,

923
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,990
His Majesty has always felt

924
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
guilty towards you.

925
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,800
Father.

926
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,260
(Ankang Garden)

927
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,880
Have some ginseng soup.

928
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,510
Do you want us

929
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,960
to send for His Highness?

930
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,320
That's not necessary.

931
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,590
His Majesty is ill.

932
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,470
Visiting His Majesty is

933
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,400
more important.

934
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,070
I don't have any urgent matter.

935
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,030
I shall return now.

936
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,540
(Ambitious)

937
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,470
You've been waiting for three days.

938
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,510
Go back and rest.

939
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,550
Song,

940
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,990
will my parents and eldest brother

941
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,110
come back?

942
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,320
I heard that

943
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,990
there was a problem on the way

944
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,440
with the combat rations.

945
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,880
The rations could not be sent in time.

946
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,150
Song,

947
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,590
has this

948
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,840
happened before?

949
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,670
(Hua Liuli,)

950
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,470
(what's holding you back?)

951
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,030
(For years, you've been thinking)

952
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,670
(about solving the mystery,)

953
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,800
(haven't you?)

954
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,860
(Pretentious Hour)

955
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,800
Changkong,

956
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,320
congratulations

957
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,760
on achieving

958
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,280
the first place.

959
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

960
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,840
Cheers.

961
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,470
Liuli has always loved

962
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,190
fun-filled events

963
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,760
since she was little.

964
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,590
When we were in Qinghan Prefecture,

965
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,720
she liked writing letters

966
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,630
to other royal members and officials.

967
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,630
Hold on.

968
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,840
So, I wasn't the only

969
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,630
recipient of her letters?

970
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,550
Only you?

971
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,110
How could that be?

972
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,590
Let me tell you.

973
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,960
I remember that

974
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,030
she wrote Prince Ying

975
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,840
and the Third Prince

976
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,960
some letters, too.

977
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,840
The third prince was still

978
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,590
a baby then.

979
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,240
She insisted on
wishing him well in a letter.

980
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,280
She wanted him

981
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,360
to read it when he grew up.

982
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,470
She was so cute!

983
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,110

984
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,360
