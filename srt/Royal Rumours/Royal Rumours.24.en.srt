Liuli.

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,480
Wake up, Liuli.

20
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,990
Liuli.

21
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,110
Liuli.

22
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,640
Liuli, wake up.

23
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,480
If not for the dry branches,

24
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,110
we could've died.

25
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,200
Wake up to our

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
beautiful lives.

27
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,150
Liuli, wake up and eat.

28
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,270
Eat the beef jerky, Liuli.

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,870
Liuli,

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,670
don't you want

31
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
a prosperous country?

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,990
We've achieved it.

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,830
If you don't open your eyes,

34
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,520
how do we see it?

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
You like

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,480
the lantern dance,

37
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,590
don't you?

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,300
After we go back,

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,830
I'll have them present a new one.

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,550
Didn't you say

41
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,320
in the future

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,710
we'd have a smooth life?

43
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,110
However, without you...

44
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,150
The tree has auspicious meaning.

45
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,550
The rest of your life

46
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,150
will surely be smooth-sailing.

47
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,990
This is Shi Shi Ru Yi
[*smooth sailing].

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
I made it

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,920
specially for you.

50
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,960
Shi Shi Ru Yi?

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,590
However, without you,

52
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,390
how can I have a smooth-sailing life?

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,360
How can I have a smooth-sailing life?

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,150
Liuli.

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,150
Liuli.

56
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,220
Wake up! Liuli.

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,200
Miss.

58
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,390
Uncle Song.

59
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,760
Miss, look.

60
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,830
The sun has risen.

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,000
You should go home.

62
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,470
Wake up, please. Liuli.

63
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,880
Liuli.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Liuli.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
Your Highness.

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't leave me.

67
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,390
I beg of you.

68
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,390
Don't ever leave me again.

69
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,030
Why are you crying?

70
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,910
I was only sleeping

71
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,760
more than you did.

72
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Your Highness!

73
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,350
Your Highness!

74
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,830
Your Highness!

75
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,980
Your Highness!

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,760
Your Highness.

77
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,030
Your Highness!

78
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,350
On our way here, Consort Xian

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,520
told us secretly that

80
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,230
if we couldn't find His Highness,

81
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,710
you'd be the crown prince.

82
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,350
She also said that

83
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,440
if we're able to find His Highness

84
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,470
and do something...

85
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,960
Your Highness!

86
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,760
Your Highness!

87
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,960
Prince Ying's pretence is

88
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,060
Your Highness!

89
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,200
flawless.

90
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,220
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,180
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

92
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,470
- Your Highness!
- The crown prince must be in trouble.

93
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,640
Shut up!

94
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,940
The crown prince

95
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,200
risked his own life

96
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
to distract the assassins.

97
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Am I a scoundrel who rubs salt

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,960
into my brother's wounds?

99
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,080
Go away!

100
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,880
Go away!

101
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,560
You're still alive!

102
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,760
Great!

103
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,640
Great!

104
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,150
Help!

105
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,320
I've found the crown prince
and Princess Hua!

106
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,960
Help!

107
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,150
Go slowly. Do you hear me?

108
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,440
Don't hurt

109
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,080
our future emperor!

110
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,700
Don't hurt Princess Hua, too!

111
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,660
It's all right to hurt
the future emperor,

112
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,390
but not Princess Hua!

113
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,000
Go slowly. Do you hear me?

114
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,350
Stop.

115
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Stop!

116
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,400
Uncle Song,

117
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,230
I've come back.

118
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,960
Your Majesty,

119
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,110
does that mean your illness

120
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,750
was just pretence, Your Majesty?

121
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,470
Of course.

122
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,160
Otherwise,

123
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,400
I wouldn't have succeeded

124
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,040
in my trickery during Taiping Banquet.

125
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,080
Yuansu

126
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,920
is caring,

127
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,710
smart, brave,

128
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,040
prudent and far-sighted.

129
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,680
However, he's still young

130
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,560
and he may misjudge
people and situations.

131
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I just wanted to support him.

132
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,400
Otherwise, if all officials

133
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,800
were controlled by Consort Lin,

134
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,630
things could've got really ugly.

135
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,230
The crown prince was willing

136
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,040
to risk his own life.

137
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,590
He really cares more about

138
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,320
the civilians instead of himself.

139
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,400
However, right now,

140
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
Yuansu, my son, hasn't returned.

141
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,990
Your Majesty,

142
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,200
my daughter Hua Liuli

143
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,200
hasn't been found yet, too.

144
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,630
In the past,

145
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,470
my empress caused political chaos.

146
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,590
The would-be successor
of Grand Preceptor Du,

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,990
Prince Consort Xie, Xie Linzhou,

148
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,750
was her accomplice.

149
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,830
Besides, Consort Lin

150
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,440
stabbed me in the back.

151
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,960
I was totally heartbroken.

152
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Your Majesty, you've indeed gone through

153
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,590
one heck of a miserable experience.

154
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,590
Your Majesty!

155
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,350
Why are you panicking?

156
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,590
The crown prince and Princess Hua

157
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,110
have been found.

158
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,510
(Be Your Own Light)
(All my life,)

159
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,110
(only Your Highness treat me sincerely.)

160
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
(I'm willing to die for you.)

161
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,660
(Confession of Sin. Your
sinned man, Yun Han...)

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,350
(I deserve death without
your forgiveness.)

163
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,110
(I wish you luck.)

164
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,230
(I'll serve you genuinely
in my next life.)

165
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,470
Your Highness.

166
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,350
Get prepared.

167
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,960
Let's hit the road.

168
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,470
Sure.

169
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,830
Yuansu.

170
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,540
- My daughter.
- Father.

171
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,420
Yuansu.

172
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,180
Liuli, my dear daughter!

173
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,500
What happened to you?

174
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,580
My daughter.

175
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,750
Father.

176
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,470
Father, go easy.

177
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,990
My back still hurts.

178
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,590
You should see an imperial physician.

179
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,510
Father,

180
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,230
I'm still fine.

181
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
We're reaching a critical point.

182
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,870
It's time to conclude things.

183
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,280
As for Princess Hua,

184
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,510
I have an idea.

185
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,320
I plan to let her recuperate

186
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,470
in Eastern Palace for some time.

187
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,680
What do you think, father?

188
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,710
Good.

189
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,230
Your Majesty,

190
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,710
in view of Liuli's condition,

191
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,990
I should take her home to recuperate.

192
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
She shouldn't live in Eastern Palace.

193
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,040
She should. She's my crown princess.

194
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,040
This...

195
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
This...

196
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,990
This

197
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
may be okay.

198
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,110
However, it's too sudden.

199
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,680
Would you give me time

200
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,230
to think about it?

201
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,960
You're right, General Hua.

202
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,470
However, General Hua, don't worry.

203
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,750
If you and General Wei agree,

204
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,590
I'll only marry Princess Hua

205
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
and no one else.

206
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,230
She will be

207
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,160
the only crown princess.

208
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,230
That's right.

209
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,960
Liuli is a bright girl.

210
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,630
If she marries into the royal family,

211
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,350
we will take good care of her.

212
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,180
- No one will bully her.
- That's right.

213
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,920
Your Majesty,

214
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,230
you know

215
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,280
my household best.

216
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,440
Everything related to
funerals and marriage

217
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,680
is decided by Mingyue.

218
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,920
I...

219
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Everything about the imperial
court is decided by me.

220
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,400
My personal affairs
are decided by Liuli.

221
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,630
General Hua,

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,230
what do you think?

223
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,590
Are you

224
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,320
sure about what you just said?

225
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm a man

226
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,320
of my word.

227
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
(I don't want to be
rebuked by your mother.)

228
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
She's awake.

229
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,630
Liuli,

230
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,200
how are you feeling?

231
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,960
Does it hurt?

232
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,110
If you go out,

233
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,870
may I go with you?

234
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,870
Of course.

235
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,920
Father,

236
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,110
I suggest concluding

237
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
the marriage proposal

238
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,350
today.

239
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,230
If there're too many items for today,

240
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,750
you may invite General Hua

241
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
to stay in the palace

242
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,960
for discussions until we're done.

243
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,110
My future happiness

244
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,470
depends on you.

245
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,500
Okay.

246
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,420
(Prince Consort Mansion)

247
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,280
Master.

248
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,830
How is it?

249
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,990
All city gates have been locked.

250
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,800
The people there obey

251
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,990
the crown prince.

252
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,040
Junior Secretary Pei has been

253
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,990
guarding the place for days.

254
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,080
Their reason is that

255
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
assassins have infiltrated the palace.

256
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,800
No one is allowed to leave the capital.

257
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,680
Yun Han

258
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,400
never told me about
the guards being changed

259
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,830
at the city gates.

260
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,990
It's all right to be trapped.

261
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,400
At worst,

262
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,990
we'll die with dignity.

263
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,200
It's your choice to stay,

264
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,040
not me though.

265
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,800
Committing treason at Taiping Banquet

266
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,870
will cause us and our
families to be executed.

267
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,200
I should instead

268
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,440
talk to His Majesty.

269
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,080
At least our daughter and I

270
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,110
may be pardoned.

271
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,440
Say no more.

272
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,470
You've talked too much.

273
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,030
It's high time you rested.

274
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,840
Princess Le Yang missed
her hometown so much

275
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,960
that she has lost her voice.

276
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,440
We have to hurry for homecoming.

277
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,980
(Yanqi Gate)

278
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,400
Commander,

279
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,400
Princess Le Yang was too shocked

280
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,230
during Taiping Banquet.

281
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,750
She is missing her hometown.

282
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,750
Could you make an exception

283
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,200
and let us leave the capital?

284
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,400
May we request her

285
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,710
to talk to us in person?

286
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm just doing my job for His Majesty.

287
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,680
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Princess Le Yang.

288
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,550
We're not lying.

289
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,790
The princess is in bad shape.

290
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,960
If she doesn't return to
her hometown in time,

291
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,990
her condition will worsen.

292
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,510
Empress Dowager will also

293
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,600
be worried, won't she?

294
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,550
Prince Consort Xie,

295
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,510
don't you feel tired

296
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,120
of pretending for so long?

297
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,600
Your Highness,

298
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,840
I just want to

299
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,840
send the princess home.

300
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,960
Stop lying.

301
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,750
What do you mean, Your Highness?

302
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,750
I want you to pay

303
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,790
for Yun Han's death.

304
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,230
So he's dead?

305
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,600
Well, the dead can't speak.

306
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,790
Prince Consort Xie,

307
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,380
death is awaiting you.

308
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,840
You should die with dignity.

309
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,600
Your Highness!

310
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,160
Your Highness!

311
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,360
Please help my mother.

312
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,270
Arrest him. Hurry!

313
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,920
Don't move

314
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,230
or I'll kill her now!

315
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,990
Grand Preceptor Du treated you well.

316
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,160
Princess Le Yang married you.

317
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,270
The Xie family has been reputable.

318
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,120
Why would you want to kill

319
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,840
your master and wife?

320
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,400
What's so great about
a reputable family?

321
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,750
I'm still belittled.

322
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,440
The woman I love became Consort Lin.

323
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,030
Grand Preceptor Du is too old,

324
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,710
but doesn't want to retire.

325
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,990
As Prince Consort,

326
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,360
the princess never treats me well.

327
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,840
Open the city gate!

328
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,990
Do you want more people

329
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,840
to die with you?

330
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,790
So what if I do?

331
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,960
Your Highness,

332
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,440
please save my mother.

333
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,310
Open the city gate!

334
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,360
Mother!

335
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,680
Master!

336
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,030
Mother!

337
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,230
Mother!

338
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,120
Liuli,

339
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,840
if you're tired,

340
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,680
let's go back to rest

341
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,880
instead of exerting yourself.

342
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,710
I want to

343
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,710
be with you all day.

344
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,470
I'll follow you wherever you go.

345
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,510
I've got it filled.

346
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,160
If you're hungry later,

347
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,680
remember to eat.

348
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,960
Where are we going next?

349
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,640
We're going to the palace

350
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,640
to see one last person.

351
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,540
(Tangli Palace)

352
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,440
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

353
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,030
You weren't involved.

354
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,510
You don't need to apologise.

355
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,640
Father

356
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,030
won't blame you because

357
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,640
of what your mother did.

358
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,750
Noted.

359
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,600
Liuli, let's go.

360
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,030
You're finally here.

361
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,680
When the evil consort caused chaos,

362
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,030
Xie Linzhou contrived

363
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,270
everything for her.

364
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,960
After the failure,

365
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,440
he escaped.

366
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,960
Since then, he had endured hardship

367
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,160
and acted on every chance.

368
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,270
The Battle of Yuncang Ridge,

369
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,160
which exhausted
the State of Jin and the State of Jinpo,

370
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,270
was his doing.

371
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,960
I know your doubts.

372
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,030
Your mother

373
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,230
was killed by me.

374
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,270
The evil consort had no offspring.

375
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,510
She promised to help

376
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,880
the third prince to ascend the throne.

377
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,990
However,

378
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,550
unexpectedly,

379
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,600
you weren't the one

380
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,440
who drank the ginseng soup.

381
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,360
I wanted to help Hong'er

382
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,640
to seize some degree of power.

383
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,960
You were the biggest obstacle.

384
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,510
Anyone in the most advantageous position

385
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,310
will have the greatest authority.

386
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,030
In this lonely palace,

387
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,840
only authority means everything.

388
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,200
It's a tie between us then.

389
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,680
Your lover

390
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
was killed by me.

391
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,400
Prince Consort Xie helped you

392
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,440
with your ambition
during Taiping Banquet.

393
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Have you ever thought that

394
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,600
it was part of his plan?

395
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,600
If it failed,

396
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,470
he would have had a way out.

397
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,960
However, you would have nothing.

398
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,600
You were tortured by him.

399
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,990
He said he loved you

400
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,680
so that you would

401
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,030
do everything,

402
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,400
hide everything,

403
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,640
kill anyone

404
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,160
and even commit treason for him.

405
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,160
You made excuses for yourself,

406
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,600
thinking it was for your benefit.

407
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,400
You were actually used by him.

408
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,160
If there's even anything

409
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,680
you'd done for yourself,

410
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,310
I wouldn't have sympathised with you!

411
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,440
You're wrong!

412
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,310
I'm not pathetic!

413
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm doing everything for myself

414
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,400
and Hong'er.

415
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
So what if I am?

416
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,310
Stop using the third prince

417
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
as an excuse

418
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,960
for your selfishness.

419
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,070
If you had ever cared about him,

420
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,680
you wouldn't have made him

421
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,070
so upset.

422
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,360
Shut up!

423
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,990
Who are you to berate me?

424
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,400
You were born rich.

425
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,600
You don't understand

426
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,310
how helpless the poor are.

427
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,640
Without fighting for it,

428
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,360
how can we succeed?

429
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,440
Why do we have to

430
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,990
eke out a miserable existence?

431
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,200
Have you ever thought

432
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,120
about the third prince?

433
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,070
If one intends to do evil,

434
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,270
his or her status,

435
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,400
what he or she encounters

436
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,750
and any trivial matter

437
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,270
can be magnified.

438
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,120
Your son asked me to give you this.

439
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,030
Come to your senses.

440
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,920
(Mother,)

441
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,640
(I'm not asking for anything.)

442
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,880
(However, I hope that)

443
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,230
(you will stop feeling down.)

444
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,030
(Let me)

445
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,310
(accompany you always.)

446
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,990
(You, father)

447
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,990
(and everyone in the capital)

448
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,270
(can live a happy
and smooth-sailing life.)

449
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,790
Your Highness.

450
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,840
Yes?

451
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,230
Will there be

452
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,510
no more battle?

453
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,710
Yes, at least when

454
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,270
the both of us are alive.

455
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,360
Does that mean we have protected

456
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,550
the centuries-old sovereignty
of the state of Jin?

457
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
My father has told me before

458
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,680
that every generation has its own

459
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,790
difficulties and misery.

460
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,120
The past emperors built the foundation.

461
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
My father inherited it.

462
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
I'll protect it.

463
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,310
When I was little,

464
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,680
I often waited for my
parents at somewhere high.

465
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,160
Then I thought to myself that

466
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,960
the general's daughter

467
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
could see her parents
returning after a battle.

468
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,920
What about other soldiers' loved ones?

469
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,960
If they died on a battlefield,

470
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,880
who would

471
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,750
bring them back?

472
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,550
Then my dad told me that

473
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,160
the people who

474
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
died fighting

475
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,070
thought about

476
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,960
not only their loved ones,

477
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,230
but also all civilians
of the state of Jin

478
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
They protect

479
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,710
not only the land,

480
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,400
but also its sovereignty.

481
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,680
My father has also

482
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,230
told me the same thing.

483
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,710
Really?

484
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,640
He asked,

485
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,200
"What is a country?

486
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,020
Does it mean the magnificent mountains

487
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,660
or the swift rivers?

488
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,400
Neither.

489
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,440
It means all the civilians."

It's beautiful.

504
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Exactly.

505
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I'm no stranger

506
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,270
to this scenery.

507
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,200
However, the sunrise today

508
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,470
is the best so far.

509
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,920
Why?

510
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,510
It's because it doesn't

511
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,440
see anyone anxiously waiting

512
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
for his or her family's
return from battle.

513
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,790
Most importantly...

514
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,160
Most importantly,

515
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,440
we're together

516
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,750
forever.

517
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,400
(What is a country?)

518
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,640
(Does it mean the magnificent mountains)

519
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,440
(or the swift rivers?)

520
00:30:59,310 --> 00:30:59,840
(Neither.)

521
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,840
(It means all the civilians,)

(all the battles,)

523
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,230
(the righteous serving
the country and civilians,)

524
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,550
(the learned in the schools,)

525
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,790
(teachers and students,)

526
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,920
(lovers')

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,790
(a life that)

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,030
(everyone can freely choose,)

530
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,400
(the warmth and pleasure,)

(Han)

534
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,160
Are you not going to see her?

535
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,120
No, I'm not.

536
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,750
Let her assume that

537
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm dead.

538
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,640
Serving the country anywhere

539
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,070
means my job

540
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,990
is putting me at risk.

541
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,270
What about my wedding?

542
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

543
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,960
I'll present a decent gift.

544
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,600
I won't make it difficult

545
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,070
for you to explain to Princess Hua.

546
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,990
Your wishes are good enough.

547
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,900
(Ji Liu Yong Jin, Love Blossoms)

548
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,710
(Princess Hua of the State of Jin)

(sincerely invites the defeated enemy,)

00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,030
(the Second Prince of Jinpo,
He Yuanting,)

551
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,640
(to bring expensive gifts
to the State of Jin)

552
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,790
(and attend the royal wedding)

553
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,270
(of the crown prince, Ji Yuansu,
and Princess Hua.)

554
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,960
She's still alive.

555
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,790
So,

556
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,310
we're not done yet.

557
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,440
One day,

558
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,200
we'll meet again.

559
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,590
Liuli,

560
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,470
tomorrow is our wedding day.

561
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,440
Are you satisfied?

562
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,110
Your Highness,

563
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,720
what do you mean?

564
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,240
I don't get it.

565
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,030
Really?

566
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,340
(Gate of Great Awakening)
Commander Yang.

567
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,580
- Here. Let me help you.
- Thank you.

568
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,550
This way, please.

569
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,360
This way, please.

570
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,540
Officer Zhang, long time no see.

571
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,320
Long time no see.

572
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,840
- Thank you.
- This way, please.

573
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,820
Thank you.

574
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,320
Yuan Wei.

00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,240
Without Miss Yao's prescription,

581
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,360
they might've still been

582
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,670
very ill.

583
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,440

You'll be generous, won't you?

587
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,590
She's the crown princess,

588
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,920
the future empress.

589
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,440
Don't you feel ashamed
of asking for gifts

590
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,280
in front of the palace?

591
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,720

was drawn up by her.

596
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,280
Mind your words, Princess Jiamin.

597
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,590
That's right.

598
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,190

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,470
Look at my dad.

601
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,670
He's careful with his demeanour.

602
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,260
If you don't register yourself,

603
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,110
- This is from me.
- His Highness will check you.

604
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,150
Don't worry.

605
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,550
