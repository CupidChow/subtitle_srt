Never show everything on your face.

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,040
I understand.

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,790
Go and see the world for me.

24
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,080
Xiuying, don't be down anymore.

25
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,760
Master Yun, do you know that

26
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
since I was little,

27
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
my great-grandpa taught me

28
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,510
to read and write,

29
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,360
told me the truths of life.

30
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,200
I also know that

31
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
many people didn't like him.

32
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,040
But...

33
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,790
But...

34
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,230
But he was really good.

35
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,790
I mean it.

36
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,390
Master Yun,

37
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,160
do you believe that?

38
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,040
I do.

39
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,150
I always do.

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,350
From now on,

41
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,760
I'll never see him again.

42
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,150
I'm sorry,

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,320
I failed to

44
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,240
protect your family.

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,260

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,680
Tian.

47
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,590
Dear.

48
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm not sure

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,590
what's wrong with me today,

50
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,830
but I'm so anxious.

51
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,910
I have a gut feeling that

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
something is going to happen.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,270
Madam,

54
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,590
we've successfully defeated

55
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,800
Jinpo recently.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,150
It's our time of victory,

57
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,800
what can go wrong?

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,150
No,

59
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,710
I'm not talking about this.

60
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,270
Look, the Hua family is

61
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
the head of military officials,

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,880
but was accused

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,830
of killing Censorate Zhu.

64
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,710
Grand Preceptor Du

65
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,950
was the head of civil officials,

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,590
but he suddenly passed away.

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,950
Even His Majesty

68
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,760
has been unwell recently.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,510
He didn't attend the morning court.

70
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,200
That's why

71
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,590
I'm so unsettled.

72
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,910
It's all right, dear.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,270
No worries, no panic.

74
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,390
Nothing is going to happen.

75
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,510
Even if there is anything,

76
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,640
I'm here for you.

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
- It'll be all right.
- And me.

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,880
Dad and mom.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
Today is the Taiping Banquet.

80
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,030
Why are you dressed simply?

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
I've grown up.

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,440
There should be some changes, right?

83
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll protect you two.

84
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,350
Good daughter.

85
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,910
Really good.

86
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,260
(Hua Mansion)

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,030
Is Liuli
feeling resentful just

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,390
because she can't
go to the Taiping Banquet

89
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,150
to enjoy

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,470
free food and drinks?

91
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,680
Dad, mom and Changkong.

92
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm full, I'll leave first.

93
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,030
Where are you going?

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,270
I'll look for His Highness.

95
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,470
- You...
- You'll go to...

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,030
Yes, I'm going.

97
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,470
I consider His Highness' matter

98
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,590
mine.

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,710
This time, I have to assure his safety.

100
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,390
I will go.

101
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,880
Don't you trust me?

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
We should protect

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,350
our beloved.

104
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,080
If...

105
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,320
Just let her go.

106
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,120
Be careful when you're outside.

107
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,540
Besides the people

108
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,320
guarding His Highness outside,

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
there are still some people

110
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,950
watching us in secret.

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,710
I'll be fine.

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,390
Yuan Wei and I will
take the secret path.

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,510
I'm leaving, mom.

114
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,240
Be careful.

115
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,760
Let's go.

116
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,270
Your Highness.

117
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,710
Are you used to studying at the academy?

118
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,030
I'm all right with everything.

119
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,000
Your Highness,

120
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,590
I have an impolite request.

121
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,150
Please allow me to continue

122
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,240
studying in the State of Jin.

123
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,560
Weren't you

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,760
not interested in studying before?

125
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,910
But since I've been
studying for a while,

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,150
I realise the girls here

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,880
can learn a lot.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,800
They can do whatever they want

129
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,880
within their own abilities.

130
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,510
They can be officials by passing exams

131
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,640
like men do.

132
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,590
They don't have to...

133
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,150
Yes?

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,510
They don't have to
live without dignity.

135
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,950
They're able to survive

136
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,200
without relying on men.

137
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,950
Your Highness,

138
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,800
even if His Highness

139
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
doesn't accept me,

140
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,030
could you please not

141
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,470
send me back?

142
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,120
Okay.

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,060
(Although I've made)

144
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,440
(a lot of wrong decisions,)

145
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,560
(bringing her to the capital this time)

146
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,120
(should be the right decision.)

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,990
What are you staring at?

148
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,470
Look at this.

149
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,560
Does it look like me?

150
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,870
Yes.

151
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,830
It looks nice, right?

152
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,320
Does it look like me?

153
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,320
Mom,

154
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,870
who is cuter?

155
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,750
This or me?

156
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,470
You used to be on a par

157
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,590
with His Highness,

158
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,830
but not anymore.

159
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
This useless thing

160
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,400
makes me lose face.

161
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,830
Why is the Hua family not attending

162
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,200
Taiping Banquet today?

163
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,950
I heard that the Hua family has been

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,830
placed under house arrest
at the western suburb.

165
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,160
No wonder I don't see them.

166
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,560
It seems that the Hua family has

167
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,160
completely lost their power this time.

168
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
The Hua family was detained due to

169
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
the death of Censorate Zhu.

170
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,400
You have to seize the opportunity.

171
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
(The Hua family is placed
under house arrest.)

172
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,080
(And His Highness
broke off the alliance.)

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,560
(It's a make-or-break moment.)

174
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,080
Hong.

175
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,630
Hong.

176
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,110
Hong, please tell me.

177
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,110
Are you feeling unwell?

178
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,350
Why is Hong not waking up?

179
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,830
Please get some water.

180
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,680
Yes, madam.

181
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,630
Tang,

182
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,710
please inform those at Weiyang Hall

183
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,590
that

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,400
I feel sick too,

185
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,920
I can't go there and infect

186
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,990
the ambassadors.

187
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,200
Yes, madam.

188
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,990
His Highness arrives.

189
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,470
This conference of the states

191
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,400
relies entirely on the support of

192
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,230
all the ambassadors

193
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,680
to be held smoothly.

194
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,920
However, His Majesty

195
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,470
is feeling unwell recently.

196
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,160
He can't celebrate with us.

197
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,440
He particularly emphasises that

198
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,520
this Taiping Banquet

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
is meant to convey a message of peace

200
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,470
to all of us

201
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,350
in hopes to establish

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,870
lasting friendship with all states.

203
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,350
Your Majesty, you're wise.

204
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,740
(Yanqi Gate)

205
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,630
No one is allowed to leave the capital.

206
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
My young lady is Princess Hua.

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,230
She has to leave for urgent matters.

208
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,440
Kindly approve this request.

209
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,040
No one is allowed to leave the capital!

210
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,950
I'm leaving

211
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,440
on the order of His Highness.

212
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,590
The situation is urgent.

213
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,870
If there is any delay,

214
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,160
can you bear the consequences?

215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,630
Any proof?

216
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,460
(Love Blossoms)

217
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,680
No one is allowed to leave the capital.

218
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,280
Look at this carefully.

219
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,950
No one is allowed to leave the capital.

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,470
Is he imitating parrots

221
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,680
as he keeps repeating the same sentence?

222
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,920
Taiping Banquet has started

223
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,750
for a while.

224
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,460
The time left for us

225
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,260
is running out.

226
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,830
But the guards are so strict.

227
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,080
Where can we go?

228
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,350
We have to look for Pei Jihuai.

229
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,560
Where can we go to look for him?

230
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,160
I know where to look for him.

231
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,320
I know.

232
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,160
(Do you mean...)

233
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,950
That guy will launch an assault

234
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,950
during the Taiping Banquet

235
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,950
and His Highness

236
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,870
will face him alone?

237
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,440
The Blackmail Troop will stand by

238
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,520
in the palace

239
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,280
and it will be mobilised
to protect His Highness.

240
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,710
I will arrange deployments

241
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,590
at every checkpoint.

242
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,470
No spies will

243
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,160
leave the capital.

244
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,800
This doesn't work.

245
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,830
The letter of
Censorate Zhu is incomplete.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,470
We don't know anything

247
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,990
besides the assassination.

248
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,590
If anything unpredictable

249
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,200
happens,

250
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,870
the consequences are unimaginable.

251
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,680
Officer Pei.

252
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,080
Please give an instruction.

253
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,110
My family has an elite army

254
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,920
outside the capital.

255
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,230
I will find a way to meet up with you

256
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,590
before the banquet.

257
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,560
You will send the army into the capital.

258
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,870
Understood.

259
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,940
(Yanqi Gate)

260
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,520
(If we're still not allowed to go out,)

261
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,160
(I will force
my way out of the capital.)

262
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,900
(An assassination.)

263
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,080
(In the letter, it's mentioned)

264
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,440
(that the person will
launch an assassination.)

265
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,710
(Well then,)

266
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,830
(I'll take the initiative first.)

267
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,920
This cup of liquor

268
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,280
is a toast to Grand Preceptor Du,

269
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,200
who was the senior for two dynasties
and lived an incorruptible life,

270
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,680
while being fair and just.

271
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,520
(No way. I've promised Princess Hua)

272
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,040
(that I'll look for Officer Pei.)

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm the attendant of Princess Hua.

274
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,590
I would like to see Officer Pei.

275
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,110
May I know where he is?

276
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,680
Officer Pei is just over there.

277
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,320
All right.

278
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,280
This mission is dangerous and urgent.

279
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,520
(Update me in time
if there's any situation.)

280
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,470
Pei Jihua!

281
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,830
Yuan Wei.

282
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,590
Finally, I found you.

283
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,160
Princess Hua is waiting
for you at the gate.

284
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,160
(I didn't expect him to be prepared.)

285
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,990
Protect His Highness.

286
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,920
Anyone who acts without
authorisation will be executed.

287
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,160
Protect everyone.

288
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,200
Understood!

289
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
Let's go.

290
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,830
It's okay.

291
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,000
Hurry up, Yao Wenyin.

292
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,800
Dad, come here!

293
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,700
It's okay.

294
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,470
Minmin.

295
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,280
Minmin.

296
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,150
Be careful!

297
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,630
It's okay.

298
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,350
It's okay.

299
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,800
Jiamin,

300
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
rescue His Highness. Faster!

301
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,760
Be careful.

302
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,480
Faster!

303
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:42,820
Minmin.

304
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,390
Watch out!

305
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,590
Come.

306
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,150
Go.

307
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,430
(They're taking action
during the Taiping Banquet.)

308
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,390
(How dare they do that!)

309
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,870
Master, everything is ready.

310
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,310
Go.

311
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,040
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

312
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,670
Yun Han.

313
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,430
Why?

314
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,280
There's no reason.

315
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,350
I'm willing to do that.

316
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,040
(I can't let the innocent)

317
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,800
(die here,)

318
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,190
(since their target is me.)

319
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Yun Han,

320
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,350
you will

321
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,040
protect everyone in the palace.

322
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,150
His Highness escaped!

323
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,280
(As long as His Highness is killed,)

324
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,110
(this mission is successful.)

325
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,590
Let's go.

326
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,870
(Yanqi Gate)

327
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,480
How's it going on?

328
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,280
Princess Hua,

329
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,110
something bad happened.

330
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,430
The enemies at the banquet

331
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,630
were harder to deal
with than we expected.

332
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,590
To assure others' safety,

333
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,280
His Highness

334
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,480
lured the enemies to the back mountain

335
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,080
on his own.

336
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,080
His whereabouts are unknown.

337
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,320
Officer Pei,

338
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,000
the gate must be opened
as soon as possible.

339
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,240
You and Yuan Wei will look for Uncle Song

340
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,080
and bring the elite army
of the Hua family here.

341
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,110
All right, I will take care of this.

342
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,590
What about you?

343
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,190
I'll rescue His Highness.

344
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,350
Princess Hua,

345
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,240
His Highness' horse
is at the city gate.

346
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,350
You can ride it to leave.

347
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,670
Thanks, Officer Pei.

348
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,910
Yuan Wei,

349
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,040
how about you wait here

350
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,670
and I'll travel overnight
to settle this issue?

351
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,350
Officer Pei,

352
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,630
it is better for you to stay here.

353
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,590
It is the mission

354
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,350
His Highness assigned to you.

355
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,240
I'm the captain of Hua Army.

356
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,240
I have the responsibility.

357
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,760
I'll take care

358
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,190
of this issue on my own.

359
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,150
Kindly give me a good horse

360
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,320
and a sword.

361
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,080
Yuan Wei.

362
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,830
Thanks, Officer Pei.

363
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,430
I'll wait for you.

364
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,040
It's over.

365
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,910
Has everyone settled down?

366
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,560
They have left one by one.

367
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,480
Master Yun!

368
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,720
Where is the imperial physician?

369
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,430
Send for the imperial physician!

370
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,080
Anyone?

371
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,080
Why are you calling for
the imperial physician?

372
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,080
Just let them all stay here.

373
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,670
Consort Lin?

374
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,720
Consort Lin, why are you here?

375
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,240
Why can't I be here?

376
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,080
Shut your mouth

377
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,480
if you still want to live.

378
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,520
His Highness used to be supercilious.

379
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,150
But he left alone

380
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,350
to rescue you all,

381
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
which shocked me a lot.

382
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,420
Were the assassins and gunpowder

383
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,560
inside the palace

384
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,240
prepared by you in advance?

385
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,240
You're right.

386
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,800
Send my regards to

387
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,560
His Majesty and Empress Dowager by the way.

388
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,590
- Yes, Consort Lin.
- Yes, Consort Lin.

389
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,240
Your Highness,

390
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,190
surrender.

391
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,000
Understood.

392
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,110
It seems I was wrong

393
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,520
about the spy in the palace.

394
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,320
It's probably a high-ranking person

395
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,480
who is able to mobilise so many aces.

396
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,870
You should appreciate your own decision.

397
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,670
After all,

398
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,080
it's better for you to die alone

399
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,870
than to continue staying

400
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,590
in the living hell at the palace.

401
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Says who?

402
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
What do you mean?

403
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,190
It doesn't matter if I die alone.

404
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,520
The state is more important.

405
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
Anyone could be Crown Prince,

406
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,960
yet no one can tell

407
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,000
who will be the winner

408
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,430
in the palace.

409
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,080
I want you dead.

410
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,520
Bai,

411
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,110
we must find him.

412
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,080
If I wasn't so impulsive,

413
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,110
I would've accompanied him

414
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,560
to the Taiping Banquet today.

415
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,830
Bai.

416
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
Don't you dare

417
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,000
to lay a finger on it

418
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,830
when I'm here.

419
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Liuli, get away from here.

420
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,520
Go.

421
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,280
Ladies,

422
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,630
you didn't expect that, right?

423
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,760
Since the position of Empress was empty,

424
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,430
His Majesty has never shown favourism.

425
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,520
Why are you treating him like this?

426
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,390
Why?

427
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,040
It's because when I was about to

428
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,630
marry my love when I was young,

429
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,800
we're separated.

430
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
After wasting so many years,

431
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,240
I still have to endure

432
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,390
your bossy attitude.

433
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,960
His Majesty arrives.

434
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,430
Did you make

435
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,830
such a terrible mistake

436
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,240
for this ridiculous reason?

437
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,960
You...

438
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,520
Aren't you seriously ill?
Didn't you faint?

439
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,390
If I didn't ask His Highness

440
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,870
to spread the news that I had fainted,

441
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,760
how was it possible to figure out

442
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,870
you and

443
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,320
the true mastermind?

444
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,830
I'm not a fool.

445
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,800
If you had told me earlier

446
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,760
that you already had a lover,

447
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,480
I would have fulfilled your wish.

448
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,220
It is not a good timing

449
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,520
to reminisce this.

450
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,390
Do you think these people here

451
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,430
can help you to gain victory?

452
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,080
General Wei.

453
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,280
They are here.

454
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,670
Arrest all the traitors.

455
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,480
- Please forgive us
- Please forgive us

456
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,110
- for being late.
- for being late.

457
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,800
(I have to be faster.)

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,430
Princess Hua, are you okay?

459
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,190
Uncle Song, I'm fine.

460
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,430
Please rescue His Highness.

461
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,480
I will stop them here.

462
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,870
Okay.

463
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,390
Don't struggle in vain anymore.

464
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,800
Your Highness, there's
little you can do.

465
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,280
Meet your maker.

466
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,320
Princess Hua, run!

467
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,000
The duty of a soldier

468
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,910
is to defend our state,

469
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,320
as long as the state needs it.

470
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,080
(Hua.)

471
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,720
We have to sacrifice for our state.

472
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,150
Song Guang, listen to me!

473
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,280
Yes, I'm here.

474
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,110
Your Highness.

475
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,800
Your Highness, are you okay?

476
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,430
Liuli, I regret it.

477
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,280
I shoudn't have

478
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,480
sent you back to the capital.

479
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
But if I didn't visit the capital,

480
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,720
how would I have encountered you?

481
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,190
Let's go.

482
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,670
Sure.

483
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,960
Watch out!

484
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,910
(If there is another life,)

485
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,870
(I hope we will not)

486
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,520
(be born in two states
which are in a war again.)

487
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,960
(Farewell, Liuli.)

488
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,800
No worries, Your Majesty.

489
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,760
I've already sent people to seek him.

490
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,320
His Highness is blessed

491
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,040
and will be safe.

492
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,150
My daughter has also

494
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,590
gone for the search of His Highness too.

495
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,960
I believe His Highness

496
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,560
will come back safely.

497
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,190
Tell me

498
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,760
who assigned you.

499
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Nobody did.

500
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,110
This was something

501
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,560
I'd been wanting to do.

502
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,320
His Highness' actions are not sincere.

503
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,590
He doesn't care about
the people's sentiments.

504
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,560
The civil and military officials
criticise him every day,

505
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,390
yet you still insist.

506
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,590
I just can't accept it.

507
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,320
I can't.

508
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,870
My Hong is as good as him.

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,080
I don't want the throne!

510
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,910
Hong, why are you...

511
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
Does it taste good?

512
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
You shouldn't

513
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,190
keep disregarding
your health like this anymore.

514
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,080
Hong, what's wrong?

515
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,870
You're the one who can't accept it,

516
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,190
not me.

517
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,480
His Highness is a good brother.

518
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,800
Father,

519
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,630
I'm willing to bear
the consequences with mother.

520
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,240
Father,

521
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,320
I request to bring an army

522
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,800
to search for His Highness.

523
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,800
Go ahead.

524
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,870
Bring your younger brother back.

525
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,800
Rest assured.

526
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,040
Your Highness, please take a rest.

527
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,440
Thanks to you all,

528
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,480
I'll wait for good news.

529
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,150
Have a safe journey, Your Majesty.

530
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,080
Mom.

531
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,340
- Mom, are you okay?
- Dear.

532
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,520
I'm so afraid.

533
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,480
Everything is fine.

534
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Yes, everything is over.

535
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,840
Mom, it's all right.

536
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,360
It's okay.

537
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,190
Come on.

538
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Everything is okay.

539
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,310
Don't have to be afraid anymore.

540
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,230
It's over.

541
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,560
It's all right.

542
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,230
It was horrifying.

543
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,560
Mom, what happened to you?

544
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,790
- Everything is over.
- It's over.

545
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,190
Come on.

546
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,840
It's over.

547
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,480
It's over.

548
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,920
It's okay.

549
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,560
Jiamin.

550
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,630
What's the matter?

551
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,630
I'm going to look for His Highness.

552
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,840
Take this.

553
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,960
And wait for me.

554
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,080
It's all right.

555
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,920
Minmin,

556
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,560
Stop staring at it.

557
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,520
(No one cares about)

558
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,110
(Master Yun's whereabouts.)

559
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,150
(Since no one is looking for you,)

560
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
(I'll be the one.)

561
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,400
Stop.

562
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
There must be an important reason

563
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,040
that made Ms. Du behave

564
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,080
like this.

565
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,190
Let her go.

566
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Master Yun.

567
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,590
Yun Han.

568
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,230
Master Yun.

569
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,480
Yun Han.

570
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,670
Yun Han.

571
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,750
Master Yun.

572
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,150
