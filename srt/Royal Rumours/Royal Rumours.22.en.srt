=Episode 22=

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,430
Oh, it's you, Princess Hua.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,840
Let me ask you something.

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,870
Were you the official in charge

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,590
of escorting food provisions

21
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,630
ten years ago

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
for the Battle of Yuncang Ridge?

23
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,960
You were called Lian Yue instead

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,150
of Zhu Jin at that time.

25
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,680
I have no idea what you are

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,360
talking about, Princess Hua.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
It's a severe crime to falsely

28
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,430
accuse an official of court.

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,750
Since you won't admit that it's you,

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,430
then I should just hand this item

31
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,360
to His Majesty

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,120
and let His Majesty decide.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
The item?

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,590
What's the item?

35
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,000
Do you even need to see it?

36
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,080
I bet you know what it is.

37
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,840
I wouldn't have come to you,

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,240
Censorate Zhu,

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,630
if it wasn't for that item.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,430
How could that item still be here?

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
You are indeed Lian Yue.

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,520
My parents were critically injured,

43
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,360
we lost so many soldiers

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,190
and tens of thousands of people

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,910
died because of you.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,630
Who's the mastermind?

47
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,870
Hua Liuli.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
Even if I did such things,

49
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,680
why would I tell you

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,150
about the mastermind?

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,910
If I tell you who it is,

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,870
do you think I can live?

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,150
Would you disregard

54
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,870
the lives of your family members then?

55
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,840
The punishment for treason is
eradication of the whole family line.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Would you insist on keeping

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,190
your master's secret

58
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,400
even if it'd cost the lives
of your entire family?

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,910
If you tell me today

60
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,800
who your master is,

61
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,280
you'll be safe.

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,960
His Majesty is benevolent.

63
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,280
He will give your family

64
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,030
a way out.

65
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
Don't you forget.

66
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
You still have a daughter

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,630
who has just turned five years old.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,710
Daddy.

69
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,840
Don't fight.

70
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,800
When will you play

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,470
hide and seek with me?

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Go ahead and hide first.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,470
I will look for you in a bit.

74
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,120
Your Highness!

75
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,190
Oh no! We have a problem.

76
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,240
Censorate Zhu was killed

77
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,310
in his study tonight.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
There's a little girl there

79
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,480
who keeps saying Princess Hua's name.

80
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,190
Does anyone else know this?

81
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,600
No, don't worry.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Supreme Court

83
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,830
has the entire crime scene surrounded.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,240
No one can enter or leave.

85
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's go.

86
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,000
Madam.

87
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,070
Madam, stop crying.

88
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,430
Your Highness,

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
the chest wound is serious.

90
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,560
It's a sword wound.

91
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,240
It looks like a soft sword.

92
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,830
(Judging by the wound,)

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,190
(it definitely looks
like Liuli's doing.)

94
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,680
(Why would she do this on her own)

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,950
(without letting me know?)

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,510
(Why did she kill Censorate Zhu?)

97
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,390
Miss,

98
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,430
you even injured your arm

99
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,560
as you went out in the middle
of the night to fight.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120
You only told me about this now.

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
How did you hold it all in?

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,950
Oh no, we're doomed.

103
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,190
Did you stir up

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,430
trouble outside?

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,190
Do we need to tell Master

106
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,720
and Madam about this?

107
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,390
I afraid they'll know
about it soon enough

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,950
without us telling them.

109
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,580
(Hua Mansion)

110
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,720
Did you hear?

111
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,480
Censorate Zhu died

112
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,600
in his study last night!

113
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
It's so tragic!

114
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,070
Initially, no one knew about this.

115
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,510
Then someone suddenly went

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,190
to capital prefecture to beat the drum,

117
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,390
appealing for justice.

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,830
They said that there's evidence

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,240
that Princess Hua was the culprit.

120
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,830
Oh my God, that is so scary!

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
What happened after that?

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,870
After that,

123
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,240
the crown prince had no choice

124
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,950
but to tell the civil officials

125
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,720
to go to Hua Mansion

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,120
to capture her.

127
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,430
That person...

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,240
Be careful.

129
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,420
(Hua Mansion)

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Liuli.

131
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,160
Madam, Miss is getting changed.

132
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,120
She's getting changed?

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,510
Madam, this is not a good time.

134
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Get out of the way.

135
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Mother.

136
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,040
Liuli.

137
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Are you hiding

138
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,390
anything from me?

139
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
No.

140
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,830
Liuli,

141
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,160
did you really kill Censorate Zhu?

142
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,800
I wanted to kill him,

143
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
but I didn't.

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
I lied that I had proof to trick him

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
into admitting his true identity.

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,830
Maybe it was because of his family,

147
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,240
he was about to tell me the truth.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I finally have

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,720
a chance

150
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,920
to make my own decision.

151
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,720
All right, I will tell you.

152
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,870
(Those people dressed in black)

153
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,120
(just tried to distract me.)

154
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,040
(They were clearly)

155
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
(targeting Censorate Zhu.)

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,750
Daddy!

157
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,510
A'Man!

158
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,830
Daddy!

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,950
A'Man!

160
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,950
(Who would do such a terrible thing?)

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,750
Censorate Zhu was Lian Yue,

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,550
the food provisions official

163
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,870
from ten years ago.

164
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,440
He escorted the food slowly

165
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,550
on purpose.

166
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,200
You and father almost died there.

167
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
So many of the soldiers

168
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,240
whom I knew died there!

169
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,390
I will never forget

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,030
what they did!

171
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,390
We will get our revenge,

172
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
but you can't be so impulsive.

173
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,270
I don't want anything

174
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,510
to happen to you.

175
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Your Highness, it's not that

176
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
I don't want to let you in.

177
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,390
You come with ill intentions.

178
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,750
Forgive me

179
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,150
for not being able to do anything.

180
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,120
Who says I'm here to capture her?

181
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,480
Why did you have

182
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,790
Hua Mansion surrounded?

183
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,600
I only brought soldiers here

184
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,550
to shut the people in the palace up.

185
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,910
I will apologise to you in the future

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,390
if I have offended you.

187
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,510
Miss,

188
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,150
His Highness sent a lot

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,030
of people here.

190
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,150
Is he...

191
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Your Highness.

192
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,550
Go outside first, Yuan Wei.

193
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,120
Yes.

194
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,600
So,

195
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,030
if I don't say anything,

196
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,120
will you not say anything

197
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,150
to me either?

198
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,390
I didn't feel wronged

199
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,500
when your parents misunderstood me.

200
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,380
Why are you

201
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,980
feeling wronged now?

202
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,340
Did I cause you trouble because

203
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,050
I acted on impulse last night?

204
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,340
Not at all.

205
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,980
It's not the first time

206
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,260
that I've been criticised.

207
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,980
I wouldn't mind

208
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,220
being criticised for you.

209
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,100
Besides,

210
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,220
you didn't kill him.

211
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,810
How do you know I didn't?

212
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,140
What if I did kill him?

213
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,810
You wouldn't.

214
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,410
Do you trust me this much?

215
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,050
Then let me ask you.

216
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
If anyone

217
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,410
told you I killed a person,

218
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,810
would you believe them?

219
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,020
I would.

220
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,500
Really?

221
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,290
All right,

222
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,930
don't be mad.

223
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,650
Why wouldn't I believe you?

224
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,140
You are the best crown prince

225
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,570
in the whole world.

226
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,690
What's wrong?

227
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,020
Show it to me.

228
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,570
You're injured.

229
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,980
I got this medicine

230
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,930
from the imperial physician.

231
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,340
We're done.

232
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,290
Does it still hurt?

233
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,770
No.

234
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,690
I'd actually been looking

235
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,930
for Lian Yue for a long time.

236
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,050
I didn't think that

237
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,500
he would be this bold.

238
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,530
I actually wanted to ask him

239
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,450
about the mastermind

240
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,140
when I looked for him last night.

241
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,690
I didn't think that

242
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,500
I would be taken advantage of.

243
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,340
What did you plan to do

244
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,690
even if you found out who it was?

245
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,690
Would you look for him

246
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,340
all by yourself?

247
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,140
Hua Liuli.

248
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,900
You already knew that

249
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
something was wrong with Censorate Zhu.

250
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,530
Why didn't you tell me about it?

251
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,340
You even got injured.

252
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,570
Why are you yelling at me?

253
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,220
Let me show you something.

254
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,140
That little girl liked

255
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,410
to play in the study.

256
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,260
When I left last night,

257
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,050
I found

258
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,930
these half-burnt letters

259
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
that she placed

260
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,020
on a cushion.

261
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,500
That's probably why they

262
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,050
didn't notice these letters.

263
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:01,900
Fine.

264
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,260
I will discuss

265
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,980
with the two generals

266
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,170
about what to do later.

267
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,410
Liuli,

268
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,140
you should also spend some time

269
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,980
to think about it.

270
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,450
I want to spend

271
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,340
the rest of my life with you.

272
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,040
(Ankang Garden)

273
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,810
(If Hua Liuli knows)

274
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,900
(Lian Yue's identity,)

275
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,260
(then...)

276
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,020
(The assassins came)

277
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,570
(as soon as Liuli entered.)

278
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,140
(It seems that Lian Yue had found)

279
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,530
(the key to the person behind it all.)

280
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,380
Liuli is currently injured

281
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,100
and resting at home.

282
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,930
I shall handle

283
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,220
everything outside.

284
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,340
Generals, there's no need

285
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,500
for you two to worry.

286
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,770
However, I won't be inviting

287
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,170
the Hua family to the States Banquet.

288
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,020
This is to prevent people

289
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,290
from escalating this issue

290
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,290
and targeting Liuli.

291
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,290
Forgive me, generals.

292
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,290
Your Highness, you are very considerate.

293
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,380
The Hua family should
be thanking you instead.

294
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,930
In addition, both the State of Jin

295
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,220
and Jinpo have suffered greatly

296
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,690
from the Battle of Yuncang Ridge.

297
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,650
The person behind all this

298
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,220
aimed not to harm,

299
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,650
but to take over the State of Jin.

300
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,900
Jihuai.

301
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,500
Yes.

302
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,020
Register

303
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,220
the Hua family in Supreme Court.

304
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,770
Say that they are under suspicion

305
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,170
for Censorate Zhu's death

306
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,260
and that we have them under supervision

307
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,020
in Hua Mansion in the western suburb.

308
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,380
Yes.

309
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:58,860
Your Highness.

310
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,900
Do you think that

311
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,380
He Yuanting

312
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,860
instigated someone
to kill Censorate Zhu?

313
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,810
The tiger is out of the mountain.

314
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,450
Since he has bared his fangs,

315
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,050
I shall meet him to see

316
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,570
if he is really as good as me.

317
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,650
Ever since the news

318
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
of the Emperor's health declining

319
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,570
has spread, there are

320
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,530
unusual actions in the capital.

321
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,860
Your Highness,

322
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,810
you should be more careful.

323
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,620
There is a great saying,

324
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,170
“Wealth is obtained from taking risks.”

325
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,930
Isn't this the very moment we have been

326
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,380
waiting for with all our planning?

327
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,770
Come on, let's deduce together

328
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
what is written on these letters.

329
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
(Ambitious)
His Highness isn't letting me out.

330
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,290
So we can only go around the courtyard.

331
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,530
I'm so bored.

332
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,140
Miss, what is that?

333
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,740
It isn't

334
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,010
an evil spirit or something, is it?

335
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,780
Don't panic.

336
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,210
Maybe it's a rat.

337
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,820
You're a rat instead!

338
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,580
Hurry and help me.

339
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,860
Jiamin.

340
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,860
Come on.

341
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,170
Why are you here?

342
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,210
Don't touch it. I sprained my waist.

343
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,900
Hurry and find a place

344
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,900
for me to sit down first.

345
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,060
Let's go.

346
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,140
Have a seat.

347
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,490
How is it? Are you feeling better now?

348
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,100
You.

349
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,490
Why did you come in

350
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,340
from our secret passage?

351
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,340
I wouldn't have crawled

352
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,490
through the dog hole

353
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,450
if those soldiers didn't stop me.

354
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,300
How dare you laugh at me.

355
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm not. Why would I?

356
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,210
I'm extremely glad.

357
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,820
I didn't think

358
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,060
that we had such

359
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,250
a strong sisterly bond.

360
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,490
You would even crawl through

361
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,650
a dog hole to see me, Jiamin.

362
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,340
You're really a great friend.

363
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,060
I'm so dirty.

364
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,450
Can you speak properly?

365
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,730
Did you want to go out

366
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,900
when you were over there?

367
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,250
Yes. The main door

368
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,410
is so heavily guarded.

369
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,930
Men are unreliable.

370
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,410
He threw the Hua family under the bus

371
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,900
because he couldn't
handle the civil officials.

372
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,580
The crown prince went over the line

373
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,930
for doing this.

374
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,690
So this is what you think.

375
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,010
Can't I think that way?

376
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,410
Of course you can.

377
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,930
You are my best friend

378
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,060
and the most reliable,

379
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,210
Jiamin.

380
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,210
You really think so?

381
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,250
Tell me.

382
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,620
Why do you want to go outside?

383
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,010
I'll help you to figure out a way.

384
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,860
Jiamin.

385
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,620
To be honest, I want to leave the city.

386
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,410
Can you help me?

387
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,250
How about this?

388
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,210
Change into my clothes

389
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,780
and go to my home
to look for my parents.

390
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,620
They will help you to leave the city.

391
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,780
Thank you,

392
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,780
but if I really wanted

393
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,060
to leave the city with Yuan Wei,

394
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,860
they wouldn't be able to stop me.

395
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,450
You…

396
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,540
You're making fun of me again.

397
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,650
No.

398
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,010
Let's go to my room quickly.

399
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,250
I'll help you to clean up.

400
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,620
Look at all the dirt on your face.

401
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,580
I'm not dirty.

402
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,620
Go. Hurry up.

403
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,450
So that's what happened.

404
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,250
Wait…

405
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,340
What?

406
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
You mean that the crown prince

407
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,730
is facing danger on his own?

408
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,300
He's locking you up

409
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,450
as

410
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,540
part of a trap?

411
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,780
There isn't much time.

412
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,210
If we want to succeed, we must

413
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,450
create an illusion to make

414
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,650
the opposing party believe that

415
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,900
if they don't do anything right now,

416
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,730
they will never have

417
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,860
a chance to take action again.

418
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,210
After hearing what you said,

419
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,780
I also feel like the capital

420
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
is a little unusual these days.

421
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,490
You only thought so
after I told you, right?

422
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,820
The Hua family

423
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,490
is the leader of military officials.

424
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,620
Now that you've been locked up,

425
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,690
it looks like they've succeeded,

426
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,930
but in reality, it's an illusion.

427
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,010
His Majesty and Grand Preceptor Du

428
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,140
aren't doing well nowadays.

429
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,650
This is definitely the perfect timing

430
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,650
to take action.

431
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,580
It's so scary.

432
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,170
Are you scared?

433
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,490
Says who?

434
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,900
Why would I, Princess Jiamin, be scared?

435
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,860
I've

436
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,730
seen it all, all right?

437
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,410
Your turn to talk.

438
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,690
Right now, you need to stabilise

439
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,210
the situation and think of a way

440
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,540
to get Prince Ying

441
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,900
to help the crown prince,

442
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,300
understand?

443
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,040
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

444
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,010
(Back then, the evil consort caused)

445
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,300
(the death of
the crown prince's mother.)

446
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,300
(His Majesty has been remorseful)

447
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,620
(after the disorder was resolved.)

448
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,970
(He never has an Empress after that.)

449
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,970
(For many years, I've been)

450
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,730
(tracking down the remaining rebels)

451
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,010
(and doing my best to get rid of them,)

452
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,300
(in hopes of keeping
the State of Jin safe.)

453
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,580
(Sir, let me)

454
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,410
(be the one to see you off.)

455
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,860
(I have great things to do.)

456
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,880
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

457
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,900
Great-grandfather,

458
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,900
your medicine is ready.

459
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:32,480
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

460
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,450
Please return home, everyone.

461
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,140
My great-grandfather
had lived a simple life.

462
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,900
He would like to
keep his funeral simple.

463
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,340
If my great-grandfather
knew so many people came,

464
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,170
he would

465
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,860
feel terribly sorry.

466
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,120
(Letter to the Teacher)

467
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,520
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

468
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,600
(Grand Preceptor Du of the State of Jin)

469
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,820
Great-grandfather,

470
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,620
we depended on each other

471
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,410
ever since my parents passed away.

472
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,650
You taught me to read, write

473
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,380
and tell right from wrong.

474
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,540
In my heart, you're the best

475
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,900
great-grandfather.

476
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,340
I am ashamed of not being able

477
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,010
to fulfil your lifelong wish

478
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,580
of seeing me having a good husband.

479
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,040
(Grand Preceptor Du of the State of Jin)

480
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,840
(Du Mansion)

481
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,380
(Even though
Grand Preceptor Du was old,)

482
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,970
(there's something
strange with his death.)

483
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,100
(I wonder if there are hidden secrets.)

484
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,900
(Everything in the room seems to be)

485
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,780
(the same. No sign of
anything being moved.)

486
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,970
(If Grand Preceptor was really)

487
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,250
(killed by another person,)

488
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,490
(it must be someone
he was familiar with.)

489
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,720
(Xie)

490
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,120
(Selected Poems)

491
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,620
(Xie)

492
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,010
(If this was a clue)

493
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,930
(left by Grand Preceptor
before he died,)

494
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,540
(why…)

495
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,340
Dear.

496
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,060
What are you doing?

497
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,650
Leave!

498
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,690
Are you still mad?

499
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,820
I really didn't have

500
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,380
a choice.

501
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,930
It's not safe outside right now.

502
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,490
A few days ago,

503
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,780
there're moles in our home.

504
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,490
I was only doing so

505
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,250
to protect you.

506
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,060
Protect me?

507
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,340
Did you really mean that?

508
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,540
Of course I did.

509
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,970
The crisis

510
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,340
is resolved now.

511
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,340
I don't have to lock you guys up anymore.

512
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,410
The turmoil outside has subsided.

513
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,450
The palace is hosting

514
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,340
Taiping Banquet in a few days.

515
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,490
You guys can then

516
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,930
relax and have some fun.

517
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,410
If you are still mad,

518
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,140
you can hit me.

519
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,250
I…

520
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

521
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,860
You scared me.

522
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,010
Caiwei, you can leave now.

523
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,730
All right.

524
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,800
(Benevolence and Virtues)

525
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,820
Miss Du,

526
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,730
may I burn an incense

527
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,730
for Grand Preceptor Du?

528
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,100
Sure.

529
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:49,970
Grand Preceptor,

530
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,100
I have come to pay my respects.

531
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,170
(Forgive me,)

532
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,140
(Grand Preceptor)

533
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,060
(I don't wish for much.)

534
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,820
(May you bless Xiuying)

535
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,820
(so that she will be)

536
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,730
(safe and happy.)

537
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,200
(Grand Preceptor Du of the State of Jin)

538
00:29:50,880 --> 00:30:01,400
(Du Mansion)

539
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,860
Master Yun,

540
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,900
I can only see you off here.

541
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,970
Thank you.

542
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,580
Please be careful,

543
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,380
Master Yun.

544
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,060
Yes.

545
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,780
I know that Grand Preceptor Du

546
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,650
was your only relative.

547
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,100
It must be a really tough time.

548
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,580
If you are feeling unhappy,

549
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,060
you can look for me.

550
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,970
Look for you?

551
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,930
If you are in the capital,

552
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
you can look for me

553
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,540
with that.

554
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,860
Thank you, Master Yun.

555
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,690
(Xiuying,)

556
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,300
(we will meet again, right?)

557
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,860
(Taiping Banquet is coming up soon.)

558
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,140
(A lot has been happening)

559
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,300
(in the capital these days.)

560
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,620
(Jihuai,)

561
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,380
(dispatch the entire Blackmail Troop)

562
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,780
(to strengthen the capital's security.)

563
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,730
(Grand Preceptor didn't
offend him in any way.)

564
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,820
(He must be aiming for something big)

565
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,780
(when he acted right at this moment.)

566
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,690
Hanhan, I'm here!

567
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
You're drinking tea by yourself.

568
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,170
I don't even complain

569
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:09,970
even though I'm so busy these days.

570
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,100
This is mine now.

571
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,170
Why are you here?

572
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,300
Look at you.

573
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,690
Can't I look for you when
I have nothing to do?

574
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,380
I'm just here to ask you

575
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,780
about the progress

576
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,970
on Grand Preceptor Mansion.

577
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,900
His Highness told you to investigate it.

578
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,100
I haven't found anything suspicious yet.

579
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,730
(You have failed)

580
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,690
(His Highness after all.)

581
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,490
It's all right.

582
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,210
If you can't find anything today,
keep searching tomorrow.

583
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,970
There's no need to rush.

584
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,250
Remain calm.

585
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,060
Why do you keep staring at me?

586
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,410
Look at you.

587
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,060
I only drank a cup of your tea

588
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,930
and you're staring at me now.

589
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,620
You're just too tired
and anxious these days,

590
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,580
understand?

591
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,860
Drink it while it's hot.

592
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,010
Drink it.

593
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,340
Oh right, I heard

594
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,650
that Great Preceptor Du

595
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,410
fainted that day

596
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,250
at Ceremonial Hall

597
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,900
and fell ill after that.

598
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,250
Poor Great Preceptor Du.

599
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,140
He won't be able to
go to Taiping Banquet.

600
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,620
You saw through me.

601
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,340
Yes, we did.

602
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,250
Did His Highness

603
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,380
realise?

604
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,860
Actually,

605
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,730
His Highness was the first to notice.

606
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,620
Why didn't he get rid of me?

607
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,620
It's because he believed that

608
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,970
he made the correct

609
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,100
choice that year.

610
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,300
Blame me

611
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,380
for letting him down.

612
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,970
To keep you alive,

613
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,930
he would rather kill Qing Yue

614
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,090
than seeing you losing your life.

615
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,380
He knew you would be forced.

616
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,090
So he wouldn't give you any task.

617
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,490
Spies all over the city were killed

618
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,930
and he said you
were asking for his help.

619
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,010
I always thought

620
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,090
His Highness

621
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,260
was a moody person.

622
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,700
I never thought that he would be

623
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,130
so benevolent to you!

624
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,900
What did he get in return?

625
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,380
You're right.

626
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm ungrateful

627
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,780
and treacherous,

628
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,610
but is he really

629
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,930
as benevolent as you say?

630
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,450
What did you say?

631
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,660
Everywhere he goes, people are scared.

632
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,180
Everyone is worried.

633
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,340
He's domineering

634
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,570
and he bullies the commoners.

635
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,340
He doesn't deserve to be
named the crown prince.

636
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,090
I wouldn't mind if others said that,

637
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,220
but how could you say that?

638
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,180
Who are you to judge?

639
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
We've been buddies for so long!

640
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,900
Say it!

641
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,300
Say that you don't mean it.

642
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,490
I do mean it.

643
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,010
You should kill me.

644
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,970
You know I'm a traitor.

645
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,130
Why are you keeping me alive?

646
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,610
Isn't it better to just kill me?

647
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,050
I know that

648
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,090
you are being controlled with a poison.

649
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,220
However, you knew that His Highness

650
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,260
had been so kind to you.

651
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,610
Why didn't you say anything?

652
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,010
Am I

653
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,490
not your buddy, too?

654
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,130
It's because I am

655
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,340
the remaining rebel of
the evil concubine gang

656
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,660
you've been looking for.

657
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,700
So kill me.

658
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Kill me.

659
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,490
Killing me

660
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,900
is your best option!

661
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,090
You…

662
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,820
Why?

663
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:03,970
There is no reason.

664
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,300
I can do what I want.

665
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:37,900
Many years ago,

666
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,900
you saved my life.

667
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,300
It doesn't matter if you were sincere

668
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,050
or faking it, but

669
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,410
I have returned the favour.

670
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,410
I have never been

671
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,180

being taken advantage of

727
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,900
is my behaviour today

728
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,010
not obvious enough?
