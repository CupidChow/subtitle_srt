=Episode 19=

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,970
When the empress of Changlong Emperor
caused political chaos,

18
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,730
violence and bloodsheds
happened in the State of Jin.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,010
Even Crown Prince's mother

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
could not escape it.

21
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,090
I

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,530
rescued you.

23
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,930
I'm giving you
the benefit of the doubt,

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,400
but you must remember

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,160
who

26
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,250
your real master is

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
and who

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,440
decides your fate.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,400
Yes.

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,900
(Jinpo)

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,280
General A'Wa.

32
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,400
Your Highness.

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,600
I knew you'd come to save me.

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
The State of Jin kept their promise

35
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,050
of the prisoner exchange.

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,440
They released you immediately
after the negotiations.

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,120
How was life in the prison?

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,810
You seem

39
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,840
to have put on weight.

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,120
That's because

41
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,330
you'd been

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
supporting me.

43
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,050
So, they wouldn't

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,210
do anything against me,

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,530
but sadly,

46
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,840
my cellmate

47
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,930
who was still young

48
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,720
was killed by them.

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
What a poor guy!

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,090
I don't care about others.

51
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,650
I'm glad that you're fine.

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,810
Since you're here,

53
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,560
let me share with you

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
a piece of good news.

55
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,840
After all the time spent,

56
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,440
I have finally found the person.

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
Your Highness,

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
if you want to win in the negotiations,

59
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,880
you can't depend only

60
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,000
on words.

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Hua Yingting and Wei Mingyue

62
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,250
have returned to the capital.

63
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,210
Only the eldest son of the Hua family

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,970
is guarding Qinghan Prefecture.

65
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,160
The border is now unguarded.

66
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,920
If we can get the border defence map

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,890
and strike when

68
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800
they drop their guard,

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,530
then it means you will have total

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,600
control over the treaty condition,

71
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,210
right?

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,210
The border defence map…

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,890
Normally, when returning to the capital,

74
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,530
the general in charge
of guarding the border

75
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,090
will have to bring the map
back to report to the Emperor.

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,010
If the intelligence was correct,

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,450
the map

78
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,040
is still in Hua Mansion.

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,360
It's not difficult to
access Hua Mansion.

80
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,720
It's only a matter of how wary

81
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,360
the Hua family is of me.

82
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,570
To find and steal the map

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,480
will probably be time-consuming.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,890
Don't worry about that, Your Highness.

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I'll find out and inform you

86
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,840
about the location soonest possible.

87
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,280
You just need to

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,360
wait at Hua Mansion.

89
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,800
Your Highness,

90
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,570
you told me in the prison that

91
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,210
we had to use emotions,

92
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,090
but what you've just said

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,480
sounds more serious.

94
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,720
To handle the State of Jin,

95
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,720
I'm willing to sacrifice.

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,770
It's no big deal.

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,920
Your Highness,

98
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,280
you're noble!

99
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,240
It's no big deal.

100
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,800
You're so noble!

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,130
It's all right.

102
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,330
Your Highness,

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,480
did you drink a lot with He Yuanting?

104
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,280
He got so drunk.

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,800
Was I awesome?

106
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,690
Of course.

107
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,690
He was driving me mad

108
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,970
during the negotiations.

109
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,650
I wish I could beat him

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,690
until he conceded.

111
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,010
Inter-state affairs

112
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,040
aren't that easy.

113
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,040
Princess,

114
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,160
you've done well.

115
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,210
Don't obsess about it.

116
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:28,920
By the way,

117
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,360
I have a present for you.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,840
What sort of present is it?

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,650
I need time to prepare it.

120
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,160
So, not now.

121
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,450
Attend the imperial court.

122
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,890
Being late is okay for me,

123
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,480
but not you.

124
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,400
Latecomers face punishment.

125
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,240
The Second Prince of Jinpo,

126
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,010
who is leading his team of emissaries,

127
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,600
feels anxious about

128
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
the negotiations

129
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,480
and wishes to express
his concerns in person.

130
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,890
Summon him.

131
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,600
Summon the Second Prince of Jinpo.

132
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

133
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,090
Formality exempted.

134
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,890
Second Prince, regarding
the negotiations,

135
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,890
what's your concern?

136
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,530
I appreciate your wisdom, Your Majesty.

137
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,570
The State of Jin achieved
great victory in the battle.

138
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,920
Jinpo concedes defeat.

139
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,010
To build a good relationship
between the two states,

140
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,400
I have a request that

141
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,570
I hope you can grant.

142
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,160
Go ahead.

143
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,800
For your information, Your Majesty,

144
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,970
during the battle,

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,890
Princess Hua

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,570
and I had met for a few times.

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,570
Since then,

148
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,240
I've been

149
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,840
missing Princess Hua.

150
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,690
Second Prince,

151
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,040
you're talking about the past

152
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,130
in the imperial court meeting.

153
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,800
What's your intention?

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,160
I must express sincerely

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
what I think

156
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,890
to His Majesty.

157
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Your Majesty, I hope that

158
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,770
you can grant my request.

159
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,840
I don't understand.

160
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,970
What is the request

161
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,050
you're making?

162
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,480
A marriage alliance has always

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,810
encouraged good ties between two states.

164
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,640
Therefore,

165
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,240
I, the Second Prince of Jinpo,

166
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,410
would love to marry

167
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,330
Princess Hua

168
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,760
for long-term mutual benefits.

169
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,210
(What is He Yuanting)

170
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,290
(plotting this time?)

171
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,690
The State of Jin won the battle.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,290
Why do we need a marriage alliance?

173
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,930
Calm down, Your Highness.

174
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,690
I'm not asking to

175
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,330
marry off Princess Hua to Jinpo.

176
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,930
Instead, I want to be married off

177
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,640
to the State of Jin.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
Conventionally, princesses are
married off to another state.

179
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,000
Now you're trying to be married

180
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,330
off to the State of Jin as a prince.

181
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,450
Your Majesty,

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,840
Grand Preceptor places great

183
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,970
importance on the negotiations.

184
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,290
He has said that

185
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,410
the state and the people

186
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,810
are more important
than personal interests.

187
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,480
I've also heard about the past

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,760
relationship between
Princess Hua and Second Prince.

189
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,930
If Second Prince is willing

190
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,120
to be married off to the State of Jin,

191
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
the two states will benefit

192
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,520
greatly in the long run.

193
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,450
Your Majesty,

194
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,120
for the benefits of every party,

195
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,810
please grant the request.

196
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,930
We agree.

197
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,330
Your Majesty,

198
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,880
when one proposes a marriage alliance,

199
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,170
must the other party

200
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,570
agree to the proposal?

201
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,970
The State of Jin

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,840
has never forced anyone.

203
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,410
Although

204
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,810
the state should be prioritised,

205
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,970
to me,

206
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,760
personal interests

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,520
are important to the civilians, too.

208
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,210
Are you willing

209
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,410
to marry him or not?

210
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,410
I am willing.

211
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,290
Second Prince, a marriage alliance

212
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,600
is a huge celebration.

213
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,840
I remember that, conventionally,

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,520
the proposal comes with

215
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,000
some conditions.

216
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,930
So, could you agree to the term

217
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,570
that the boundary of Qinghan steppe

218
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,880
will be receded

219
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,720
and two walled and moated cities

220
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,450
will be returned to us?

221
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,450
Besides,

222
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,880
your proposal

223
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,720
must have resulted from

224
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,640
deep consideration.

225
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
May I ask

226
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,600
if the gifts are prepared?

227
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,480
(Beat him at his own game.)

228
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,170
(Turn the tables on him.)

229
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,760
(Excellent!)

230
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
If I remember correctly,

231
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,120
Princess Hua's brother

232
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,120
must pass the official examinations.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,930
Hence,

234
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,520
we shall resume discussions

235
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,120
after the examinations.

236
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,810
Dismiss.

237
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,450
Dismiss.

238
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,640
Long live the Emperor!

239
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,520
Yuanhao and Yuansu.

240
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,930
What do you think about

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,090
He Yuanting's marriage

242
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,050
into the Hua family?

243
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,290
Father,

244
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,450
He Yuanting is cunning and ambitious.

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can't grant the marriage.

246
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,410
He Yuanting indeed has

247
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
good taste

248
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,520
for liking

249
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,640
the fiancée you chose

250
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,810
for me.

251
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,690
Yuanhao,

252
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,290
are you still

253
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,450
thinking about Princess Hua?

254
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,690
No.

255
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,760
I'm just praising

256
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,120
He Yuanting's taste.

257
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,210
I'm also telling father

258
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,290
that I'm in love

259
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,570
with someone else.

260
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,330
Father, you don't have to

261
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,240
worry about me and Princess Hua.

262
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,880
Since you understand,

263
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,690
let's stop talking about it.

264
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,520
Of course I understand.

265
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,690
I understand it better than anyone else.

266
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,640
Father,

267
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,690
excuse me.

268
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,450
Father,

269
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
He Yuanting must be after something

270
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,520
and that his plan

271
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,480
needs to start with Liuli.

272
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,810
I don't accept the marriage.

273
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,640
I don't like it either.

274
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,600
Since you understand,

275
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
why are you worried?

276
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,450
Princess Hua

277
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,570
was calm

278
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,240
and we clicked well.

279
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,520
She was so calm that

280
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,690
I got a bit panicky.

281
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,050
He Yuanting's proposal
of the marriage alliance

282
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,570
is nonsense!

283
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
Luckily His Majesty

284
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,880
respected sister's opinion

285
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,810
and didn't grant his absurd request!

286
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,240
If he agreed,

287
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,930
I'd go all out

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,050
to confront him at the palace.

289
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,930
My dear,

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
calm down.

291
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,480
It's not decided yet.

292
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,840
Father and mother,

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,930
He Yuanting proposed the marriage

294
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
amidst the suspended negotiations.

295
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,600
He must be planning something.

296
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,760
You mean…

297
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,690
I think

298
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,600
we shall

299
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,880
trap him.

300
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,120
Let's see what he's

301
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,360
up to.

302
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,000
General and Madam.

303
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,970
Second Prince of Jinpo is
here and he asks to see you.

304
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,090
Good timing.

305
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,880
I'll let him in

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,640
and confront him!

307
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,690
Brother,

308
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,600
he must be well-prepared.

309
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,880
Let me deal with him.

310
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,840
Why are they not here

311
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,640
to receive us?

312
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,720
I think

313
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,050
they're hiding something.

314
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,360
I'm feeling

315
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,290
anxious.

316
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,000
Take things as they come.

317
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,570
What do you mean?

318
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,690
Try to find out

319
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,840
the structure of Hua mansion.

320
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,410
Find out as much as possible.

321
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,810
Look for the likeliest place where

322
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,570
the border defence map is kept.

323
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,360
I'll stay here.

324
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,930
During the imperial court meeting,

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
I accepted the marriage proposal,

326
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,840
but he said

327
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,450
the matter was important and
it needed further discussion.

328
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,930
Clearly, his main intention

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
wasn't the marriage.

330
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,410
He just wanted to buy time.

331
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,090
Is he trying to trick us?

332
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,000
The negotiations have come
to an awkward situation.

333
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,810
He's trying to

334
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,050
steer it right.

335
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,050
So, right now, we

336
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,000
need to

337
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,090
find out

338
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,290
what he wants.

339
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,970
Whatever.

340
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
We'll handle anything on the fly.

341
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,210
I don't want to think too much.

342
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,840
Let's cook the soup.

343
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,020
(Full Recipe of Ten-Herb Soup)

344
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,720
Where could it be?

345
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
What are you doing?

346
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,810
I…

347
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,930
I'm looking for the toilet.

348
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,210
You're looking the wrong way.

349
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,970
It's there.

350
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,810
I see. Thank you.

351
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,760
(Hua Mansion)

352
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,840
(Hasn't Crown Prince)

353
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,090
(received my message?)

354
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,520
Your Highness.

355
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,210
How long has

356
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,690
He Yuanting been here?

357
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,410
It's been around 15 minutes.

358
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,690
Jihuai, follow me.

359
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,090
Your Highness,

360
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,810
don't be angry.

361
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,840
Changkong, don't worry.

362
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,290
I know what to do.

363
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,290
It's not here.

364
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,970
Brother.

365
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,170
Brother.

366
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,240
I'm going now.

367
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,760
Brother!

368
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,970
I'll miss you!

369
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,690
Your Highness,

370
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,240
I shall go first.

371
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,800
You…

372
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,080
Stop!

373
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,560
Stop!

374
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Liar! Stop!

375
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,610
Stop!

376
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,720
- Stop!
- My goodness!

377
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,410
Okay!

378
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,080
- I can't do this anymore.
- You're such a big liar!

379
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,080
I treated you sincerely

380
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,210
like a real brother.

381
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,690
The first thing I did
after leaving prison

382
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,450
was asking Second Prince
where you were buried

383
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,480
so that I could burn hell money for you.

384
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,690
I never thought

385
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,130
you'd trick me!

386
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Take it easy.

387
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,000
Come on.

388
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
I want to be friends, too,

389
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,240
okay?

390
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,080
Unfortunately,

391
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,520
we're from two opposing states.

392
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,170
We obey different kings, don't we?

393
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,080
Say no more!

394
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,650
Be understanding.

395
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,040
You, the people of Jin, stink!

396
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,970
Hua Liuli is a good example

397
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,240
as she cheated Second Prince.

398
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,930
I treated you like a brother,

399
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,610
but you manipulated me.

400
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,690
By the way,

401
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,480
did you tell anyone

402
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,610
everything I told you

403
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,520
in the prison?

404
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,760
Of course.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,320
No way!

406
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,800
I did.

407
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,240
I'll kill you!

408
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,930
Your Highness,

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,320
you seem thick-skinned

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,130
for always sticking around.

411
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,280
For the sake of love,

412
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,080
it's normal

413
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,410
to be criticised and scorned.

414
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,650
The soup is ready.

415
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,850
Your Highness,

416
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,000
what brought you here?

417
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,130
Second Prince of Jinpo is let in.

418
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,970
What about me?

419
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,240
Of course you're welcome.

420
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,000
I've told you that

421
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,720
you're our important guest.

422
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
Send for my second elder brother.

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,610
Sure.

424
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Your Highnesses,

425
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,450
let's go.

426
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,650
I think both our guests

427
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
should enjoy

428
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,930
the soup first.

429
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,280
(Jin people's table manners)

430
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,320
(seem weird.)

431
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,760
(Is this soup)

432
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,610
(drinkable?)

433
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,650
So?

434
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,000
How's the taste?

435
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,690
Nice.

436
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,080
Even the royal chef

437
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
can't beat your cooking.

438
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,690
This is for you.

439
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,970
You did it on purpose.

440
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,130
Not really.

441
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,850
I heard that

442
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,000
He Yuanting wanted to stay.

443
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,720
So I added a few more

444
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,930
ingredients to the soup.

445
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,850
I never thought you…

446
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,370
Sorry for that.

447
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,650
Let's meet at midnight

448
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,130
at the same old place.

449
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
(Jinpo)

450
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,170
Your Highness.

451
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,720
Your Highness.

452
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,480
Your Highness.

453
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,130
I've committed treason.

455
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,560
How so?

456
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,800
I didn't know

457
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,080
my cellmate

458
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,890
was from the State of Jin.

459
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
I even treated him like my brother.

460
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,760
General A'Wa,

461
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,000
calm down.

462
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,760
You were tricked.

463
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,280
You didn't intend to do it.

464
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,240
That's right.

465
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,970
Think carefully.

466
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,970
What did you say to him?

467
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,650
I think I said a lot.

468
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,560
I told him about your hobbies,

469
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,800
your character,

470
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,450
what you did when you were little

471
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,930
and what scared you.

472
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,410
Will he

473
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,320
use what you're scared of

474
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,280
against you?

475
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:44,930
Also,

476
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,080
you're scared of Hua Liuli, right?

477
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,130
Will it affect

478
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,000
our plan?

479
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
You…

480
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,170
This…

481
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,930
So will it or will it not?

482
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,690
What's that smell?

483
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,720
Princess Hua,

484
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
Junior Secretary Pei,
where's Crown Prince?

485
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,320
Crown Prince

486
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,480
is waiting for you in the woods ahead.

487
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,970
You can go there alone.

488
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,040
Yuan Wei,

489
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,890
we'd better stay

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,690
and wait here.

491
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,130
Who would want to stay with you?

492
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,480
I want to accompany Ms. Hua.

493
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,650
Crown Prince gave the order.

Liuli,

508
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,180
I have something to tell you.

509
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,240
When I was little,

510
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
I always read repeatedly

511
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,930
the letters you wrote me.

512
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
I felt warm reading them.

513
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,450
They brightened up

514
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,210
my life.

515
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,370
Then I felt that

516
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,800
you were a faraway friend

517
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,800
keeping me company.

518
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,240
After seeing you,

519
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,900
I suddenly felt that

520
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,560
besides peace,

521
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,970
an important person

522
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,000
was waiting

523
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,610
for my protection.

524
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,480
When I first arrived in the capital,

525
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,320
why did you cause me so many problems?

526
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,410
I'm sorry.

527
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,650
I had seen so much trickery

528
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,720
in the capital

529
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,720
that I forgot about

530
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
the ray of hope you gave me.

531
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,240
I won't suspect you anymore.

532
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,480
However, I think

533
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,130
the capital is a good place.

534
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,370
Really?

535
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,240
When Princess Jiamin and I

536
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,650
were kidnapped,

537
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,720
I saw you

538
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,280
suddenly appearing outside the city.

539
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,210
I realised that

540
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,280
there was someone

541
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,000
in the capital

542
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,890
willing to go all out

543
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,560
to look for me.

544
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,650
Since then, you've been protecting me.

545
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,210
I'm very touched.

546
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,930
I never thought that you'd

547
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,040
change to become

548
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,410
who you are now, just for me.

549
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,890
I never thought

550
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,320
you'd decorate the place for me.

551
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,080
Come here.

552
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,650
Hurry up.

553
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,560
It's a heart shape.

554
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,170
I told you

555
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:01,970
we had better wait.

556
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,480
You didn't tell me why.

557
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,240
It's getting more and more interesting.

558
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,170
Yuan Wei, here.

559
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,650
It's all right. Take another one.

560
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,890
I don't want it.

561
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,450
Lower your voice.

562
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,720
Next.

563
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,480
I…

564
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,280
I know, right?

565
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,450
I…

566
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,410
Your Highness,

567
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,370
I like it.

568
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,320
Really?

569
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,450
Look, Liuli.

570
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,930
There's something else for you.

571
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,410
Look at the tree.

572
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,080
Besides the lanterns,

573
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,130
there's something unique that

574
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
I specially prepared for you.

575
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,370
Is it this one?

576
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,260
(Ji Liu Yong Jin. Hua Hao Yue Yuan)
[*Stay in Jin forever. Love blossoms.]

577
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,410
Ji Liu Yong Jin. Hua Hao Yue Yuan.

578
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,080
Our names are engraved

579
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,690
on the jade pendants.

580
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,520
Choose one.

581
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,170
Is it a must to choose?

582
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,560
You wouldn't dare to say no.

583
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,450
I'll take this one

584
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,370
because

585
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,280
my name is on it.

586
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,370
Do you know

587
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,890
what the choice

588
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,130
means?

589
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,560
Doesn't it…

590
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,930
It's raining.

591
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,610
It's raining.

592
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,240
Such heavy rain!

593
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
What are we going to do?

594
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,280
Oh, no!

595
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,130
Oh, no!

596
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,410
Why?

597
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,130
It's raining and

598
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,240
they're still there.

599
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,040
They are not done yet.

600
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,320
They are not done yet.

Your Highness,

604
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,450
say no more.

605
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,560
I get it.

606
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,890

Just put them on the cart.

616
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,000
That was so enviable.

617
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,080
How I wish

618
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,610
someone could do

619
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,610
that for me.

620
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,210
Brother,

621
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,000
give it to me.

622
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,850
Thanks.

623
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,080
Yuan Wei,

624
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,480
if you like it,

625
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,650
you can have it.

626
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,890
Are you serious?

627
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,520
Is anyone else there?

628
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,450
Finally, we can go home and sleep.

629
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,890
Wait for me, brother.

630
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,480
Pei Jihuai!

631
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,380
(Grand Ambition)

632
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:12,850
Miss.

633
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,170
Yuan Wei,

634
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,240
look.

635
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,080
Look at the little hearts.

636
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,480
Am I not awesome?

637
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,650
I have made

638
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,000
Crown Prince fall

639
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,890
for me.

640
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,800
Of course.

641
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,650
You're Princess Hua after all.

642
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,210
Yuan Wei,

643
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,520
something is wrong with you.

644
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,650
What happened?

645
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,560
It's…

646
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,240
Forget it.

647
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,480
Compared to the Hua family's problems,

648
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,000
it doesn't matter.

649
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,080
Is it because of Pei…

650
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,930
No!

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,040
Nothing has happened.

652
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,690
Miss, don't think too much.

653
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,720
Rest early.

654
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,220
(Hua)

655
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,020
(Hua Mansion)

656
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,040
He Yuanting?

657
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,930
What happened to you?

658
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,240
My house is burnt down.

659
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,450
I have nowhere else to go.

660
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,970
I can only seek shelter with you.

661
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,450
With me?

662
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Since I met you when I was kidnapped,

663
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,130
you've been in
the State of Jin for long, right?

664
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,890
I don't believe that

665
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,210
you can't find shelter elsewhere.

666
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
I really

667
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,850
don't know anyone

668
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,690
in the State of Jin

669
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,170
except you.

670
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,130
You're Ceremonial Officer.

671
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,000
Longjin Street is also nearby.

672
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,170
Of course

673
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,410
I should seek shelter with you.

674
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,040
Bye.

675
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,450
One last thing.

676
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,850
I can forget

677
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,610
that you cheated me,

678
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,850
but when we were in Qinghan Prefecture,

679
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,970
you promised to

680
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,480
offer shelter

681
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,720
if I had

682
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,130
nowhere to go.

683
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,140
(If you face any problem someday,
I'll try my best to help you.)

684
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,240
(You'll agree for sure.)

685
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,040
My daughter,

686
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,450
is that true?

687
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,520
Father,

688
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,130
he made it up.

689
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,930
It doesn't count.

690
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,370
It doesn't count but

691
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,560
you're Ceremonial Officer.

692
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,240
You have to deal with it.

693
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,970
That's right.

694
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,650
He is

695
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,080
making a scene

696
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,760
and doesn't want to leave.

697
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,040
If we don't accept him,

698
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,410
it won't feel right.

699
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,200
Father,

700
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,730
what have we done wrong?

701
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,410
He…

702
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,330
He's doing this on purpose.

703
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,160
Miss.

704
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,330
He set fire

705
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,410
to his residence.

706
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,120
(Are you trying to win me over?)

707
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,480
(You've overestimated yourself.)

708
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,370
He Yuanting,

709
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,290
you're ruthless.

710
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,850
You're using my position
as Ceremonial Officer

711
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,480
to threaten me with

712
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,930
false claims.

713
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,680
I shall ask you again.

714
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,890
Are you

715
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,200
sure that you

716
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,930
want to live in Hua Mansion?

717
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,640
Yes, I am.

718
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,520
The house is very small.

719
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,330
My second elder brother is
preparing for examinations.

720
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,890
He mustn't be disturbed.

721
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,250
You'll stay here.

722
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,770
Your offer of shelter

723
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,640
has helped me a great deal.

724
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,200
I'll have someone

725
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,640
to tidy up the courtyard.

726
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,410
Your Highness,

727
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,930
Don't try

728
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,810
anything stupid here.

729
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,290
What are you talking
about, Princess Hua?

730
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,600
I can't thank you enough.

731
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,850
Excuse me.

732
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,080
Miss,

733
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,850
shall we get Song

734
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,850
to spy on him?

735
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,000
This annoying guy not only

736
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,040
wants a marriage alliance,

737
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,290
but is also seeking shelter here.

738
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,730
What is he trying to do?

739
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,480
He's doing all that for you.

740
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,810
It's my fault.

741
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,410
I blame it on my charm.

742
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,520
I have to take good care of

743
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,290
my appearance and body.

744
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,120
I need to get some rest.

745
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,250
Song, spy on him.

746
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,330
No problem.

747
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,970
(Since she lets me stay,)

748
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,520
(I won't leave so easily.)

749
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,370
(Things are close at hand.)

750
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,890
(This time,)

751
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,330
(what I want)

752
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,850
(should be closer to me.)

753
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,250
Sir,

754
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,040
I've settled down by myself.

755
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,560
Why don't you attend to other duties?

756
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,370
You're our important guest.

757
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,330
I'm guarding the room outside.

758
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,290
In case you need anything,

759
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,040
just call out to me.

760
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,480
I'll think about it.

761
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,850
(Judging by the tight security,)

762
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,680
(the border defence map
must be in Hua Mansion.)

763
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,480
(As long as I get it,)

764
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,080
(Jinpo)

765
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,160
(will probably win in the negotiations.)

766
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,850
Nothing.

767
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,730
Thank you

768
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,000
for your help.

769
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,330
Coincidentally,

770
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,640
I'm

771
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,330
marrying Princess Hua soon.

772
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,810
This is a good chance

773
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,160
for me to greet and serve you

774
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,450
and help out with the chores

775
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,890
so that I can familiarise myself

776
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,250
with the wonderful family.

777
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:27,970
You…

778
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,120
Your Highness,

779
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,000
the marriage alliance

780
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,160
isn't crystallised yet.

781
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,810
I believe that

782
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,770
it will happen soon.

783
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,200
Excuse me, I shall make a move.

784
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,290
My goodness.

785
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,680
My goodness.

786
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,250
He's insane.

787
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,850
He has too much thoughts

788
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,810
on his mind. That's all.

789
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,480
Since Liuli has let him in,

790
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,680
we shall see

791
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,250
what he's trying to do.

792
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,520
(General Wei, I've heard that
you're skilled in martial arts.)

793
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,930
(I'll learn a thing or two from you.)

794
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,060
Please stop!

795
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,770
(He's challenging my mother.)

796
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,600
(He'll embarrass himself.)

797
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,730
(Is the border defence map)

798
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,600
(possibly kept hidden here?)

799
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,810
Not bad.

800
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,040
Keep it up.

801
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,810
General.

802
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,330
Changkong,

803
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,520
stock for you.

804
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,930
Hold on!

805
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,730
Sister.

806
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,560
Are you tired so soon?

807
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,480
Faster.

808
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,200
Why are you running in
smaller circles now?

809
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,080
You're not strolling!

810
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,250
Faster!

811
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,940
Dismiss!

812
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,340
(Hua)

813
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,060
(Hua)
Great.

814
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,810
Let's rest.

815
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,600
(Why hasn't Prince Consort Xie)

816
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,370
(found out where)

817
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,890
(the border defence map is?)

818
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,290
(Anyway,)

819
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,730
(I've got familiar)

820
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,730
(with the mansion.)

821
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,600
(If I have to do find it on my own,)

822
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,890
(it won't take long.)

823
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,700
(Hua Mansion)

824
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,970
Your Highness!

825
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,410
Bad news!

826
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,000
Jin…

827
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,250
The Second Prince of Jinpo…

828
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,330
I know.

829
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,850
Do you?

830
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,200
Wait.

831
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,410
Aren't you angry,

832
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,000
Your Highness?

833
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,980
He Yuanting burnt down his own house,

834
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,450
didn't he?

835
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,200
Why should I be angry?

836
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,370
I know

837
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,770
his every move.

838
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,730
Is this

839
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,600
the most expensive fruit in the capital?

840
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:24,680
Try some.

841
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,330
Not bad.

842
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,330
Yun Han,

843
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:30,930
you've been

844
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
splurging recently.

845
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,290
I must investigate you when I'm free.

846
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,160
(It's quite sweet.)

847
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,810
(Yuan Wei will like it.)

848
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,770
Is there anything else?

849
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,040
No.

850
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,680
You're wise, Your Highness.

851
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,890
but

852
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,520
I think Second Prince

853
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,730
is up to something.

854
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,600
Look,

855
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,680
he's hoping for

856
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,770
the marriage alliance and

857
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,000
has suddenly moved into Hua Mansion.

858
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,290
He's not even worried about
any misunderstanding.

859
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,560
What do you mean?

860
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
He has

861
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,200
moved all his stuff

862
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,080
to Hua Mansion.

863
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,730
Why didn't you say that earlier?

864
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,450
I thought you said…

865
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Wait for me.

866
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,120
Your Highness!

867
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,060
(Pretentious Hour)

868
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,970
Squat down.

869
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,290
Squat down, everyone.

870
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,970
This looks better.

871
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,330
Where's Xian'er?

872
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,480
Xian'er.

873
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,770
Why are you there?

874
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,810
Swap places with Liu.

875
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,890
Your Highness, have some tea.

876
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,890
Jihuai,

877
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,000
look.

878
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,680
Does the whole formation

879
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,770
create an unprecedented

880
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,850
sense of romance, elegance

881
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
and nobility?

882
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,000
Offer your opinion

883
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,290
and ideas.

884
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,640
Check if any adjustment is needed.

885
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,890
Your Highness,

886
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,640
can I really do that?

887
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,160
Of course.

888
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,770
We've always been close.

889
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,450
Let's be honest with each other.

890
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,410
I'll say it then.

891
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:07,680
Look,

892
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:08,850
the extra performer there makes

893
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,770
the formation squarish.

894
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,890
The other side doesn't look round

895
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:11,730
without a performer.

896
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,520
However, it still looks good.

897
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,160
Your Highness, all works

898
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,080
created by you

899
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,410
are perfect.

900
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,850
Your Highness,

901
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,330
what does the formation mean?

902
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,730
Can't you see?

903
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,160
It means Hua Hao Yue Yuan.
[*Love blossoms.]

904
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,080
Hua Hao Yue Yuan?

905
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,330
I see.

906
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,080
Yuan [*round].

907
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,290
It's squarish here.

908
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,810
It's yuan [*round] there.

909
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,450
