00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,901
Stop! There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

2
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,801
I've done nothing wrong.
Those punks--

3
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:16,934
Me neither!

4
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,067
Those assholes dragged me here.
I swear!

5
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,034
Shit, what do we do now?

6
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,534
Get down on the ground.

7
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,334
Get down!

8
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:28,301
We're not with them.

9
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,934
No. You have to believe us, sir.

10
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,801
Why did you shoot at me?

11
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,434
Jae-hyo, it's not this.

12
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,167
Open your mouths and you're dead.

13
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,067
Hello?

14
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,434
Hey, it's me. Some rats came
into the laundry place.

15
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:59,101
<i>Now? Are they our guys?</i>

16
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,434
No, they're just a bunch of kids.

17
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,967
One of them came by the other day.
They're amateurs.

18
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,858
Damn.

19
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,701
<i>Check the safe first.</i>

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,734
Okay. Bye.

21
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:33,401
Fuck, why make this harder
than it already is?

22
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:34,534
Just shut up!

23
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:37,734
Why? We're all going to die anyway.

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,701
I don't see him.

25
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:48,534
How am I supposed to do this
with my hands tied like this?

26
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:59,367
I said you're dead if you open your mouth.

27
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:09,634
Please save me.

00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,234
So my son was locked up in here like this?

36
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:48,434
Yes, seems so.

37
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,067
Ma'am.

38
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,767
I think you should see this right away.

39
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,601
Why are you looking at me like that?

40
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,401
Are you all thinking that
my son is in there?

41
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,634
Why can't you answer?

42
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:33,167
But you know what? I think differently.

43
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:38,234
Until I see his body with my own eyes,
my son is not dead.

44
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,834
Don't just stand there.
Go out and find him right now.

45
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,967
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,601
I gave you three days.
So you have only one day left, right?

47
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:52,934
Yes.

48
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,801
Talk.

49
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:16,334
I've reported it to the higher-ups.
They're sending some men.

50
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,467
And the rats?

51
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,034
Kill them.

52
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,071
Kill them?

53
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,801
They said they'll take care of the bodies.

54
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:31,167
Okay. Thanks.

55
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,734

85
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,767

She won't die, will she?

00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,951

99
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,084
Oh no.

100
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:58,384
You press down firmly here.

101
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:01,051
Hang in there.

102
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,567
Come on!

103
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,767
Hurry up and do something.

104
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,267
Quick. Do something. You have to help her.

105
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,101
Okay. Hang in there.

106
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,901
You have to hang in there. Please...

107
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,401
Hey.

108
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:05,201
Hey.

109
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,134
Hey.

00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:14,267

113
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,699
Damn it.

114
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,101
It's all fucked up.

115
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,467
It's over.

116
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,234
This isn't our money!

117
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,201
Get out of the way!

118
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,434
Get lost, you fucking bastard!

119
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,367
No, you can't touch the money in here!

120
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,467
Fucking get out of the way!

121
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,334
Get in.

122
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,801

Lee Jun-seong! Lee Jun-seong!

124
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,201
Jun-seong, we have to go now.

125
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,801
We have to go!

126
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,001
Get in.

127
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:53,234
I haven't given up on Min-woo yet.

128
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:58,001
So do whatever it takes to find him.

129
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:00,034
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,367
You may not have kids,
but you have parents.

131
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:06,467
You know what I mean, right?

132
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,701
I don't have parents.
I don't even know them.

133
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,667
I'll do the best I can.

134
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,201
I made all that up.

135
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:33,634
I didn't know there was money in there.
I lied to save my ass.

136
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,001
I'm sorry about that. My bad.

137
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:38,734
But you can't touch that money.

138
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,867
It belongs to some really scary people,
and if you get caught...

139
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:46,034
your family won't be safe either.

140
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:48,334
Family?

141
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,967
-Then you should've fucking stopped him!
-You think I didn't try?

142
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:56,101
What could I do when he was
going batshit insane?

143
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,734
Shut the fuck up, both of you!

144
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,867
If we're going to get killed
whether we take the money or not,

145
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,001
we should take it, shouldn't we?

146
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:23,501
What the fuck are you doing!?

147
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,467
Give me the phone. I have to call my mom.

148
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:26,834
-Don't.
-Give it!

149
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,301
-Don't.
-Give it!

150
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:31,201
I said don't! Fuck!

151
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:35,934
Jun-seong.

152
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:42,134
Please give me the phone.

153
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:47,367
My mom could be in danger because of me.

154
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,034
Please, I'm begging you.
Give me the phone.

155
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,634
Please, Jun-seong. Huh?

156
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,634
I've got us a room, so let's go now.

157
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,901
You turned your phone off, right?

158
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,334
Give me your phone.

159
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:14,234
Give it to me!

160
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:16,167
Damn it.

161
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,434
No, Jun-seong. I need it.

162
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,534
-Where's your phone?
-Just leave me alone.

163
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,901
For Pete's sake, get your shit together!

164
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,567
Both of you, get out.

165
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,167
Hello, sir.

166
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,567
This way.

167
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,901
It's a woman. The cause of death
is excessive bleeding.

168
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:06,401
I'm guessing she was shot by the caretaker
while running away.

169
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:09,701
She was shot here and bled out.

170
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:11,834
ID?

171
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:15,767
Nothing particular. Just run-of-the-mill.

172
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,601
-But do you know what's odd?
-What?

173
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,334
I found her ID in her wallet.

174
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,701
According to her address,
she lives right next door.

175
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,367
Next door to Song Jae-hyo.

176
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,167
It's a strange coincidence.

177
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:39,467
So you're saying she was an accomplice
to Park Min-woo's kidnapping?

178
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,434
And she did it for the money?

179
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,367
Yes, it appears so.

180
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,834
No CCTV cameras?

181
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,501
Nope, we didn't let them install any.

182
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:51,434
Get the guys to search the entire area.

183
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:55,101
Check personal CCTVs and dashcams.
Do whatever it takes.

184
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,767
Find them by tonight. Got it?

185
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,167
Got it.

186
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,301
What is that?

187
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,634
Park Min-woo.

188
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:28,667
Tell us everything you know
about those guys.

189
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,467
In our house, we called him Director.

190
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,134
Director Hwang.

191
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:45,301
His assets are in the trillions.

192
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:48,167
He is loaded with money.

193
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:52,134
But it's not just a cartel
with a ton of money.

194
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:55,834
These people kill without batting an eye.

195
00:20:55,834 --> 00:21:00,334
If we get caught, we're all just dead.

196
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,667
Our families too.

197
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,201
This could be for the better.

198
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:22,634
What?

199
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:25,034
As you said, we've all become accomplices.

200
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,701
Hear me out.

201
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,901
We're heading south to a remote area.

202
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,934
We'll keep going south
and won't come back to Seoul.

203
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:41,401
We'll lie low until things die down,
then come back to Seoul.

204
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:44,001
The money will be split equally
among the three of us.

205
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:47,267
You've really gone crazy.
You want to take me too?

206
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:50,501
Of course. So you can't go to the police

207
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,167
or tell your mom.

208
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:57,601
Hey, we can do this.

209
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:01,667
The money we've got here
is at least 20 billion won.

210
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,134
You really think those thugs
won't find us?

211
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,501
You...

212
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,934
did you take the dead woman's phone?

213
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,434
No?

214
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,467
She followed us.

215
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:28,567
She filmed us with her phone.
You think this will die down?

216
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,301
What should we do then?

217
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:37,501
You want us to give up the money
because of a dead woman, huh?

218
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,734
Haven't things turned out
the way you wanted?

219
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,801
Min-woo can't report us, we don't
have to kill him, and we're loaded now.

220
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,601
Didn't it all work out just fine?

221
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,101
You fucking bastard!

222
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,434
Argh, fuck.

223
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,767
Two people are dead!

224
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:55,034
One was self-defense,
and the other, we didn't kill!

225
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:57,467
So why are you flipping out on me?

226
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:02,601
You fucking asshole.

227
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:06,367
If you're so desperate, do something

228
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:10,867
instead of just sitting around.
You need the money just as bad!

229
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:15,534
Damn you.

230
00:24:55,467 --> 00:25:01,034
I hope you feel to your bones the price
you must pay for embezzling funds.

231
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,467
Believe me! It won't happen again, sir.

232
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,067
-Turn it on.
-Sir.

233
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:06,301
Director! Please, spare me!

234
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:09,867
Please forgive me, Director! Please!

235
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,767
Faster!

236
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,167
Faster!

237
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,701
So, the kid is alive?

238
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,134
Yes.

239
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,734
That's good news.

240
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,067
But we have a problem.

241
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,567
What is it?

242
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,201
Our laundry was raided.

243
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:44,167
We think it was the kidnappers
and Park Min-woo.

244
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:49,801
So you're saying.

245
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:54,234
Park Min-woo's mom staged
the whole incident?

246
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:57,367
She was playing me from the start, huh?

247
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:02,601
No, sir. I think she was fooled too.

248
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:05,801
By who? By her own son?

249
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:12,034
So you came here to defend her?

250
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:18,034
Tell me exactly. Was she fooled
or do you think she was fooled?

251
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:25,334
She was fooled.

252
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:33,601
You know what happens to anyone
who touches that money, right?

253
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:38,801
You also know that whether she was
fooled or not is beside the point.

254
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:43,301
I want her here by tomorrow morning.
I'll speak to her face to face.

255
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:45,467
I will call her.

256
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:49,367
No. You bring her here.

257
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,967
By dawn.

258
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:57,801
<i>There has been a string
of unfortunate incidents in which</i>

259
00:26:57,801 --> 00:27:00,634
<i>financial problems drove people
to make extreme choices.</i>

260
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:02,701
<i>On the 23rd,</i>

261
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:06,767
<i>a mother and daughter were found
dead in Seoul,</i>

262
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:10,334
<i>while the day before yesterday,
in Incheon, two teenage brothers</i>

263
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,967
<i>were found dead
and their parents unconscious.</i>

264
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,567
<i>Han Dong-ho has the story.</i>

265
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,467
Go ahead.

266
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,201
You go first.

267
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:50,101
Don't try anything stupid.

268
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:16,134
Nothing yet.

269
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,401
What?

270
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,834
If those thugs disposed of the bodies,

271
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,934
they wouldn't need to call the cops.

272
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,034
Anyway, nothing on the news yet.

273
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,501
Hey.

274
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,067
What do you think we should do with him?

275
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:03,034
What?

276
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,534
I mean...

277
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:09,367
I have a feeling
he could be trouble for us.

278
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,101
What trouble?

279
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:12,601
I just...

280
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:16,034
I just think he'll backstab us.

281
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:19,201
You just said he's our accomplice.

282
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:22,201
I know. I did.

283
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,634
But, do you really think
he can be trusted?

284
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,667
What I'm saying is

285
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:33,730
that we should keep a closer watch on him.

286
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,902
Buzz off.

287
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:36,734
Jun-seong.

288
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,734
I'm done. It's all yours.

289
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:46,467
Keep a close eye on him.

290
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,134
Come home with me to my mom.

291
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,667
Then I'll give you all the money.

292
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,601
What?

293
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:31,367
Those people are really scary,

294
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,501
but my mom will be able to protect us.
I give you my word.

295
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,067
Piss off.

296
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:40,801
Jun-seong, please.

297
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:44,901
I don't want to die like this.
You have to help me. I'm begging you.

298
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,434
Just fuck off!

299
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:49,534
You can fucking take it all,
the 20 billion!

300
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,601
Think carefully.

301
00:30:55,767 --> 00:31:01,501
You can save your dad, I can save my mom.

302
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:04,401
Our families' lives are at stake.

303
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:07,701
Don't act like a fool, okay?

304
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,767
Ma'am?

305
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,967
They sent a text.

306
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:33,567
It appears they aren't able to trace
Song Jae-hyo and Lee Jun-seong's phones.

307
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,067
Ma'am! Ma'am!

308
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,654
Fucking asshole.

309
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:57,501
Come on.

310
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,167
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

311
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,227
ARE YOU SLEEPING? WHERE ARE YOU?
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING? HONEY?

312
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,447
HONEY

313
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,234
Her phone is off?

314
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:50,067
Son, you're here?

315
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,601
There was a ruckus in
the semi-basement last night.

316
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:57,934
That med student must have borrowed money
or be in deep trouble.

317
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:00,801
A bunch of thugs broke in and...

318
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:01,901
And what?

319
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:04,245
And ransacked his house.

320
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,334
If anyone asks, pretend not to know.

321
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:11,367
They did pay generously
for the door repair,

322
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,567
but if word gets out--

323
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:15,701
Hey! Where are you going?

324
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:28,067
Su-an! Su-an!

325
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:42,980
JAE-GYEONG

326
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,501
Jae-gyeong.

327
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,001
<i>Where are you now?</i>

328
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:54,301
I'm at Su-an's, but she's not here.

329
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:56,067
Seems she didn't come home last night.

330
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:00,334
<i>What happened to Su-an?</i>

331
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,967
