1
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:10,365
How does it feel to be out of the army?

2
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:11,832
Have you matured at all?

3
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:13,458
It's the same.

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:15,579
Where's Tae-yeong?

5
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:16,871
He said he couldn't make it.

6
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:19,666
Will it be just the two of us
drinking, then?

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,009
Someone else is joining us.

8
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:22,460
Who is it?

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,670
Park Min-woo.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,922
He was in our class back in tenth grade.

11
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:27,507
You know, the rich guy.

12
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:30,218
I remember him. That rich punk.

13
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:32,137
Since when were you two close?

14
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:34,097
We're not.

15
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:35,765
He's almost there.

16
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,683
Let's go.

17
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:41,646
-You punk--
-That depends on the situation.

18
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:43,148
-I'm serious--
-Jae-hyo!

19
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:45,825
-But those are identical--
-I'm right, you know.

20
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,611
Sorry I'm late.

21
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,905
Don't be. We just got here too.

22
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:53,116
Fancy seeing you here, Jun-seong.
It's been a while.

23
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:55,160
You remember me? It's been ages.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,495
Are you joining the military, too?

25
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,748
What's so funny?

26
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:02,375
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?
I was discharged yesterday.

27
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,169
You were discharged yesterday?

28
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:05,545
I had no idea. Sorry.

29
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,715
You might as well go again.
Enlist with Tae-yeong.

30
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,676
You're just saying anything
since you'll be a military doctor.

31
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:14,888
Military doctors have to serve 36 months.

32
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:18,475
-But you have it easy.
-How long are we going to be drinking?

33
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,976
Why? Do you have a problem?

34
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,103
No, I wouldn't say that.

35
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:25,774
I just need to get home by midnight.

36
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:26,942
What?

37
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:29,319
Aren't you too old to have a curfew?

38
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,737
Is this a rich family thing?

39
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,197
-No, I'm not rich--
-Hey.

40
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:34,074
It's fine. Forget it.

41
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,201
We'll get you a taxi if we run late.

42
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,078
Don't make such a fuss.

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,538
It's freezing. Let's go inside.

44
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,332
Can you hold your liquor, Min-woo?

45
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:43,625
Don't tell me you're going to black out.

46
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,927
I actually love to drink.
I also drink quite often.

47
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:47,220
Let's go.

48
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,256
It's so cold.

49
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,883
-Gosh, it's cold.
-Let's get going.

50
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,760
I'd love some gopchang and soju.

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,470
That sounds delicious.

Hey.

-Get up.
-What's wrong?

60
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:12,774
He's awake.

61
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,741
Darn it.

Jeez.

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,630
I knew it.

66
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,264
-He didn't even drink that much.
-Hey.

67
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,967
That much was a lethal dosage for him.

68
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,218
I suppose.

69
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:24,471
He doesn't know how to enjoy soju.

70
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:27,348
He must have his own problems too.

71
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,976
Problems, my ass.

72
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:32,979
I heard his dad passed away
a few years back.

73
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:37,908
He just lives with his mother now.

74
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,655
Tell me.

75
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,658
What's your plan for the future?

76
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:50,121
Are you going to keep working
at your dad's restaurant?

77
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,622
Hey.

78
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,960
Do you know why I enlisted early?

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,836
Wasn't it because of sports betting?

80
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,421
Damn it.

81
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,176
When I was 20,

82
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:08,306
this guy at my part-time job
was always watching something.

83
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,892
So I asked him what it was,

84
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,686
and he said he was making money.

85
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:15,105
-Let me see.
-He said it was simple

86
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:17,691
and that I only had to
guess the winner right.

87
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,026
So I tried it right away.

88
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,486
Holy shit.

89
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:23,597
And he was right.

90
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:26,616
No way!

91
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:27,951
ORYUGOL BBQ

92
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,870
Eventually, I lost everything
and decided to quit at one point,

93
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,414
but that's when he told me

94
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,791
he knew of a game
where he was sure we'd never lose.

95
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,418
So...

96
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:38,712
I gave him all my money for that bet.

97
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,379
What money?

98
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,175
I took out a loan.

99
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:49,222
But that bastard
stopped showing up to work the next day.

100
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,182
Jeez.

101
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:53,393
I took out a private loan
and gambled daily

102
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:55,394
to pay back that loan,

103
00:06:57,355 --> 00:07:00,055
but I ended up owing
tens of millions of won in no time.

104
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,985
I couldn't stop.

105
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:05,488
Still,

106
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:07,782
didn't your dad pay it all back?

107
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,994
-Darn it! Let me go!
-Hold still.

108
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,079
-Here we go.
-Hold him.

109
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,542
Did you think I'd just let you go
if you ran off to the army

110
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,753
-with my precious money, you prick?
-Shit!

111
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:25,508
Four hundred million won?

112
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,177
Hold on.

113
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,721
I never borrowed that much from you.

114
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:32,682
But time has passed since then.

115
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:33,767
You know what?

116
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,685
-What are you doing?
-I gave you a huge discount.

117
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:37,646
-Stop moving, you punk!
-What are you doing?

118
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:40,523
Jun-seong.

119
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,691
Fuck.

120
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,359
Please don't kill me, sir.

121
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,196
I'll pay you back.

122
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,239
-I'll give you your money!
-Goodnight.

123
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:55,997
Let's just go home.

124
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:02,545
What are you doing?

125
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,008
Here it is.

126
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,973
Do they teach you things
like that in med school?

127
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:15,141
I'm short on cash these days.

128
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,936
He won't remember a thing anyway
since he's drunk.

129
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:19,520
You crazy bastard.

130
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,107
We're almost there.

131
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,942
Watch out for those stairs.

132
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:24,943
-Careful.
-Watch the stairs.

133
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,861
-One, two, three.
-Watch your step.

134
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:29,656
Hold him up properly.

135
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,908
-Darn it.
-Gosh.

136
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,211
What?

137
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,455
-Great.
-Hey.

138
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,833
-It's freezing.
-Take off your shoes.

139
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,126
Hey.

140
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,710
Damn it.

141
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,341
Hey, take off your jacket first.

142
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:50,927
Damn it.

143
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,305
Your other arm.

144
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:06,818
-Gosh.
-Here.

145
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:08,737
How did he get so tall?

146
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:11,239
Tell me about it. I'm so jealous.

147
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,742
And another thing.

148
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,535
He's so boring.

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,415
He was never fun to be with.
I just hang out with him.

150
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,375
You two weren't close in school though.

151
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,585
When did you become close friends?

152
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,086
We're not close.

153
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,840
It's only been a few months

154
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,051
since I got back in touch with him.

155
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:35,096
We just started hanging out recently.

156
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,556
-Because he pays for drinks?
-Come on.

157
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:38,058
That's not it.

158
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,601
Drop the act.

159
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,727
Let's just drink.

160
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,728
Go grab some food. I'm hungry.

161
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:51,245
They asked me to pay back 400 million won
as soon as I got discharged.

162
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:55,450
What are you on about?

163
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,869
I thought my dad paid back everything,

164
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,954
but there was still some left.

165
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:04,918
The interest snowballed
over the last 18 months.

166
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,503
That's ridiculous.

167
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,672
I know.

168
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,091
It doesn't make any sense.

169
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,343
But I have to pay up,
or else they'll take my organs.

170
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:17,054
You know what?

171
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:21,101
I was so determined

172
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:23,161
to make a fresh start after my service.

173
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,899
That's what I promised myself.

174
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,735
But I'm screwed.

175
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,197
I think my life is over.

176
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,074
Tell them to go to hell.

177
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:40,244
Their whole business is illegal, anyway.

178
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,627
Hey.

179
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:52,882
You were a model student
and even got into med school.

180
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,969
You can afford to mess up a few times.

181
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:00,556
But as for losers like me,

182
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:04,018
we're done for after one misstep.

183
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:07,814
That's just how fucked up the world is.

184
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:10,400
Hey.

185
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,193
You should hurry and do something, too.

186
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:14,070
NOTICE OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY MEASURES

187
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,322
You were all in on it together...

188
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,699
You can't be the only one to get expelled.

189
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,639
EXPULSION FOR SONG JAE-HYO

190
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:24,037
Damn it.

191
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:34,006
What would you know
when you're a medical student?

192
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:08,040
Answer your darned phone.

193
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,130
It's not mine.

194
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:18,050
It must be that idiot's then.

195
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,410
Who is it?

196
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,498
Don't tell me he has a girlfriend.

197
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:52,960
He doesn't.

198
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:55,088
It's his mom.

199
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,548
MOM
SLIDE TO ANSWER

200
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:59,175
I forgot.

201
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:02,178
He said he needed to get home by midnight.

202
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:03,263
Hey.

203
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,223
Let's get him home in a taxi.

204
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:07,558
It's freezing.

205
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:13,877
RECENT CALLS, MOM

206
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:26,411
MOM

207
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,461
Hello?

208
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,422
Where are you, Min-woo?

209
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:41,384
It's late. Why haven't you come home yet?
You're making me worried.

210
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:44,095
You didn't even tell me
where you were going.

211
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:46,973
Hello?

212
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,475
Can't you hear me, Min-woo?

213
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:51,770
Hello?

214
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,354
Your son

215
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,482
is with us.

216
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:00,778
If you want to see him again,

217
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,740
don't contact anyone

218
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,534
and prepare

219
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:09,036
one billion won.

220
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:14,251
Otherwise,

221
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,127
your son will die.

222
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,101
Gosh.

223
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:34,813
Do they have acting classes
in med school, too?

224
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:37,440
You almost had me, you know.

225
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:40,485
What did she say?

226
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,153
I don't know.

227
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:43,822
I hung up on her.

228
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:46,157
What did she say before that?

229
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:49,828
You said that bit about one billion won
after you hung up, didn't you?

230
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,496
She asked him where he was

231
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,207
and said she was worried,

232
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,042
so I gave her an answer.

233
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,212
I told her that we have him with us,

234
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:00,838
and that his ransom...

235
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,008
is one billion won.

236
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:07,554
What?

237
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:08,930
What's wrong?

238
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,724
You hung up after telling her that?

239
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:13,893
Really?

240
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,394
Yes.

241
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,772
You crazy bastard.

242
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:19,941
Give me that.

243
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:22,485
Damn it.

244
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,325
Give me his phone.

245
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,410
Why would you pull a prank like that?

246
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,746
I never said it was a prank.

247
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:34,831
What?

248
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,541
It wasn't a prank.

249
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,918
I mean it.

250
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:39,628
You really want to hold him for ransom?

251
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,128
Yes.

252
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:46,468
Jae-hyo. That's a crime, you lunatic.

253
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,511
That would be true

254
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,180
if the cops got us.

255
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,140
We're not living in the 80s.

256
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,267
If she reports us,
they'll find us within a day.

257
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,020
That's what you think.

258
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,356
They can't track us
with his phone turned off.

259
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,191
Don't give me that crap.

260
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,318
What about the security cameras?

261
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,737
There were tons of cars
parked in the alley.

262
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,364
That's my point.

263
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:10,700
How would they
ever go through all those cameras?

264
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,037
We used cash at the pub

265
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:16,790
and got into a random taxi off the street.

266
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,211
Can you pin down when, how,
and why we came to this part of town?

267
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,337
Can you?

268
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:25,215
Unbelievable.

269
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:29,010
If you don't stop this madness,
I'll report you myself.

270
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,595
Go ahead.

271
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:34,136
But you know you'll go down
as my accomplice, right?

272
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,603
You carried Min-woo

273
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:41,689
all the way up here voluntarily.

274
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:45,402
I won't be the only one they arrest.

275
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,778
What's gotten into you?

276
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:49,238
Do you still not get it?

277
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:52,158
This will get us

278
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:55,828
half a billion won each, you moron.

279
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,382
-Give me his phone.
-I won't.

280
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,967
-Call the cops.
-Jae-hyo!

281
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,927
Do you want to
screw your life up that badly?

282
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,054
This drunk stunt
will make you a loser like me.

283
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:14,556
My life is already over!

284
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:16,766
If you're screwed, what does that make me?

285
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,233
Never mind.

286
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:29,237
Just decide if you're in or not.

287
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:30,947
You have five minutes.

288
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,866
Give me the stupid phone.

289
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,368
Hand me that phone, you punk.

290
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,872
Jeez. You idiot...

291
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,706
Fuck!

292
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,545
Screw you.

293
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:47,755
Damn it.

294
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:52,344
Let me go, you lunatic!

295
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,720
Hey!

296
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,306
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

297
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:02,312
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

298
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,605
You son of a...

299
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:05,565
Damn it!

300
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,363
Damn it.

301
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:12,905
Give it here!

302
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:17,702
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail...

303
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,795
You fucking asshole!

304
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:28,463
You prick.

305
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:29,881
Let's say you and I

306
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,509
worked ourselves to the bone for a decade.

307
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,011
We'll never be able to make
500 million won.

308
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:36,972
But him?

309
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:39,182
He probably owns buildings
that are worth billions.

310
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:43,102
You must be nuts.

311
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,786
I can't believe you.

312
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:01,496
Damn it.

313
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,427
Jun-seong.

314
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:19,055
Some have it easy

315
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:22,141
just because they were
born into a rich family,

316
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:24,798
but for some, our lives are over

317
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,481
the moment we're done
serving in the military.

318
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:30,608
That's how things are.

319
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:33,611
You have five minutes.

320
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,364
Make up your mind.

321
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,306
Fuck.

322
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,229
DUCT TAPE

323
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:09,247
CABLE TIE

324
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,038
SENIOR ADVISOR GU JA-GUK

325
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,457
FORMER ABDUCTION RESPONSE TEAM LEADER

326
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:22,076
In this field, he's a renowned expert.

327
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,839
Damn it.

328
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:39,761
You could take
either of these two options.

329
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:41,721
You could go to the police

330
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,682
or deal with it privately.

331
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,558
Dealing with it privately

332
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,477
means complying with their demands.

333
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:48,979
I would recommend

334
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,772
the former over the latter.

335
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,148
May I ask why?

336
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:54,943
Even if the ransom is paid
without a police report,

337
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,569
most culprits

338
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,572
end up killing their hostages.

339
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,802
You said the kidnapper said "us"

340
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:23,096
while on the phone, correct?

341
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:27,559
Kidnappers rarely work alone.

342
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,685
It's a sure bet

343
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:31,062
that they had this planned as a team.

344
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:33,188
Hey!

345
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:37,235
Open the darned door, you punk!

346
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:38,528
Hey!

347
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:39,988
Jae-hyo!

348
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,739
Open the fucking door.

349
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,826
Open the door!

350
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:47,203
Jae-hyo, open up.

351
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,956
Jae-hyo, you bastard!

352
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:50,874
MOM

353
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,500
Come on, you moron!

354
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,127
In my opinion,

355
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:58,840
they are highly skilled professionals.

356
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,384
They are not to be treated lightly.

357
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,969
Come on!

358
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:06,139
Hey!

359
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,266
You lunatic.

360
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,006
What do you think you're doing?

361
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,395
What gives?

362
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:14,564
What's wrong with you?

363
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,179
Hello?

364
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,183
Hello? I can't see anything.

365
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:51,810
Darn it.

366
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,978
-What do we do?
-Is anyone there?

367
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:05,198
Help!

368
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,950
Somebody help me!

369
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,100
Did you guys tie me up?

370
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:51,703
If you ever decide
to get the police involved,

371
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:55,039
you should contact me first.

372
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:08,720
Ms. Kim.

373
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,220
Yes, ma'am?

374
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:13,933
Contact the Federation immediately.

375
00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:34,704
He's breathing.

376
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:36,372
He's just knocked out.

377
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,860
But guess what?

378
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:44,045
We'll be in trouble...

379
00:24:44,673 --> 00:24:47,968
if he throws up after he wakes up.

380
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:50,803
But it's not that bad right now,
so we're good.

381
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:56,476
Damn it.

382
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:04,651
Jae-hyo.

383
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:06,736
Let's stop.

384
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,321
You said he's all right.

385
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:10,073
Let's get him to a hospital,

386
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,157
call his mom,

387
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:14,202
and tell her we were fooling around
because we were drunk.

388
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:16,663
I bet she'll let it go.

389
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:18,540
Nothing will happen.

390
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,209
I'll get on my knees and beg her.

391
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,919
Please!

392
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:34,431
This is the police.

393
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,307
Please open up.

394
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:42,814
Is anyone home?

395
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,119
POLICE

396
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,787
Do you own the place?

397
00:25:58,496 --> 00:26:02,375
No, I'm just a tenant. What is it?

398
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,085
We received a complaint.

399
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:07,464
Someone reported
a loud commotion in this unit.

400
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,674
Right. I see.

401
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:12,385
Did you fight with the man behind you?

402
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,680
Well, not exactly.

403
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,182
I wouldn't say we fought.

404
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,142
We just argued for a moment.

405
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,268
But that's over now.

406
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:23,354
Is it just the two of you in there?

407
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:28,609
Let me check the premises for a second.

408
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:32,030
It'll only take a minute.

409
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,740
Excuse us.

410
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:41,998
It's not just an argument.

411
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,583
You were drinking.

412
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,801
-This happened tonight, right?
-Yes.

413
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,886
Was it really just an argument?

414
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,306
Yes. Of course.

415
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:22,080
How much did you have to drink?

416
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,458
Well, we just had some beer.

417
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,136
Let's see.

418
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:37,596
You son of a bitch!

419
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:39,347
-Gosh.
-There they go again.

420
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:41,099
-Hey!
-Step away from him.

421
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,684
-Hit me.
-Can't you hear me?

422
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,936
-Knock it off, okay?
-Why you...

423
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:45,979
Damn you.

424
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,315
-Stop it.
-Hey, guys--

425
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,984
-You think you're all that?
-Young man. Stop it!

426
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:52,110
Are you okay?

427
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,612
-Stay still!
-You pathetic--

428
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,906
-Come here!
-Who the hell do you think you are?

429
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,366
-Hey.
-Stop. Stay away.

430
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:00,327
Damn it.

431
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,746
This is your last warning.

432
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:04,247
Knock it off.

433
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,124
I told you to knock it off.

434
00:28:06,124 --> 00:28:08,043
I'll shoot!

435
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:09,627
Don't you hear me?

436
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:20,555
It's so cold.

437
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:22,348
Is the heating broken?

438
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,225
What are you doing?

439
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:25,310
Honey.

440
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,520
Cops arrived and went into that unit.

441
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,564
It took them forever to respond.

442
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:31,399
How typical.

443
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,199
You know what?

444
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,117
I hope there's been a murder.

445
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,452
POLICE RECRUITMENT EXAM

446
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:45,121
That'd be a great story
for your interview.

447
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:48,750
"I've reported a major crime
that happened next door!"

448
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,628
"I'm ready to serve as an officer!"

449
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,590
Interviewers would give you
a pass right away.

450
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,926
I bet they just fought while drinking.

451
00:28:57,926 --> 00:28:59,934
You said you saw three men going inside.

452
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:02,472
I did.

453
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,765
But then again,

454
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:06,559
it was too loud to be an ordinary fight.

455
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,894
That's true.

456
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:10,354
It didn't sound like a squabble, right?

457
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:14,692
Here they come.

458
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,243
Honey.

459
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:25,662
The police just came out with two men.

460
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:27,162
And?

461
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:30,374
-I just can't move...
-Get moving!

462
00:29:31,585 --> 00:29:33,586
Both of them are in handcuffs.

463
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:36,802
What?

464
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:38,736
WRITTEN STATEMENT

465
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:45,265
Start off with your personal info.

466
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:47,434
And then, write down
when you started drinking

467
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:52,022
and why you got into a fight
logically with all the details.

468
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:53,315
In the case

469
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:55,942
that your statements don't match

470
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:58,069
or involve lies,

471
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,906
you'll head straight to jail.

472
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:02,407
We'll lock you up.

473
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:03,867
Got that?

474
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:06,119
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

475
00:30:06,828 --> 00:30:09,080
Gosh. Give me the report.

476
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,751
Stop messing around.

477
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,293
Why you...

478
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,668
Excuse me.

479
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:58,504
What's wrong?

480
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,808
I actually

481
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,678
have something to tell you.

482
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,354
Well, you see...

483
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,189
Sir, it's an emergency.

484
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:18,566
I need your help.

485
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:24,406
-An elderly dementia patient went missing?
-Yes, sir.

486
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:26,116
You can just trace their phone.

487
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:29,702
Their phone is off,
so we can't track it via satellite.

488
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:32,872
They can't track us
with his phone turned off.

489
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:34,583
I only have the cell tower data,

490
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,293
and the last call was made in this area.

491
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:38,420
What about the security cameras?

492
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,048
The smallest radius from a cell tower
only reaches four to five kilometers.

493
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:45,719
We don't have the time to go through
all the cameras within that radius.

494
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:49,222
How would they
ever go through all those cameras?

495
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:51,766
I'd rather look for
a needle in a haystack.

496
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:52,851
I get it.

497
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:56,563
That's why I'm only asking you to help me
patrol the area a little.

498
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:58,815
Their son is an assemblyman.

499
00:31:58,815 --> 00:32:02,235
The higher-ups want us
to put on a show, at least.

500
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:05,530
All right. Tell Officer Kang
not to come back

501
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,450
and keep making the rounds.

502
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,201
Yes, sir.

503
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:12,203
What do we do with them?

504
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:14,706
-What?
-Them.

505
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:16,582
Let them go with a warning.

506
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,338
POLICE

507
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:22,922
Goodbye.

508
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,655
If you want out, that's fine.

509
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:53,620
Are you really going to do this?

510
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,080
Of course.

511
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,290
I already sent her a picture.

512
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,708
What else can I do?

513
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,467
I'm off.

514
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:16,393
Damn it.

515
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:17,375
Stamp it.

516
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,214

<i>You know what?</i>

519
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:32,033
<i>I was so determined</i>

520
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:34,202
<i>to make a fresh start after my service.</i>

521
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:37,747
<i>That's what I promised myself.</i>

522
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:39,833
<i>But I'm screwed.</i>

523
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,959
<i>I think my life is over.</i>

524
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:45,797
<i>Some have it easy</i>

525
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:48,883
<i>because they were
just born into a rich family,</i>

526
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:51,686
<i>but for some, our lives are over</i>

527
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:53,986
<i>the moment we're done
serving in the military.</i>

528
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:56,808
<i>That's how things are.</i>

529
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,839

Yes.

What about Min-woo?

00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:34,930
Will you let him go afterward?

536
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:43,647
Of course.

537
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,147
How?

538
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,613
I have a plan.

539
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:12,384
Who are you? What's going on?

540
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:13,844
Untie me!

nod once.

Jun-seong.

557
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:19,552
