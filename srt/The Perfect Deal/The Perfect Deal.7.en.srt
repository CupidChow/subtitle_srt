1
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:41,620
Ma'am.

2
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,569
Hold on.

3
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,369
How long did I sleep?

4
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,445
Five to six hours.

5
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:59,603
I vowed to not even

6
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:03,669
take a sip of water
until Min-woo came back.

7
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:09,103
And yet... I slept like a log.

8
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,803
Your body couldn't take it any longer.

9
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,867
My body has accepted it.

10
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,669
The death of my child.

11
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:26,303
You have a visitor.

12
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,438
The director would like to see you.

<i>Ripped and corrected by YoungJedi</i>

19
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:00,469
There's a hunting ground
near the crime scene.

20
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:03,803
The people there all hunt illegally.

21
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:07,803
It's like a battlefield
even during the day.

22
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:11,903
I think she was probably shot while
wandering around the area.

23
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:16,669
Hear that?

24
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:30,103
I have good news and bad news.

25
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:34,869
The good news is that your son
is alive and well.

26
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:40,762
The bad news is that your son
and his friends

27
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,562
have put our organization at serious risk.

28
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,836
Are you able to recognize his face?

29
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,336
How can a mother not recognize
her child's face?

30
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:12,703
That's all I needed to know.

31
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:27,703
See that?

32
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:32,436
Typical of a parent, a mother.

33
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:35,803
All she cares about is that
her child is alive.

34
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:38,936
It doesn't matter one bit that
he put other people at risk.

35
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:41,603
As long as her son is alive.

36
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:45,503
That's perfectly understandable
as a parent.

37
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,936
But,

38
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:51,203
isn't it wrong for her to act
that way in front of me?

39
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,622
When money has been
stolen from the safe.

40
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:56,896
Aren't I right?

41
00:04:57,703 --> 00:05:00,636
You're right, sir.

42
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:10,836
Find her son and kill him.

43
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:13,169
Kill the deranged mother too.

44
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,069
Kill them all.

45
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:19,669
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,836
How much progress have you made?

47
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,603
Are you close to finding my son?

48
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:54,565
We're searching for the vehicle.

49
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,362
It won't be too long.

50
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,169
Sir! Sir!

51
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,136
We just found the kids.
They're in a motel nearby.

52
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,036
It's not too far from here.

53
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,936
Lead the way.

54
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:19,336
I'm telling you I saw that prick using
a phone last night.

55
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,803
He fucking smashed all our phones
and he had one stashed away!

56
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,103
Ah!

57
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,136
What's this?

58
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,769
What the fuck are you guys
planning to do to me?

59
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,703
Huh? Hey!

60
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,336
Hey! Shut your hole!

61
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,569
You fucking talk too much.

62
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:43,136
All done? We should change cars first.

63
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:50,769
I'm going to the store.
Want something to eat?

64
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,069
I'll be back.

65
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,936
Lee Jun-seong, I know you two
are bosom buddies.

66
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:14,736
But you need to think carefully.
This isn't the way!

67
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,469
Who do you need right now?

68
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,536
It's not him, but me and my mom.

69
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:01,503
Fuck.

70
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,803
I don't need all that money.

71
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,203
Just 500 million won, as we had planned.

72
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:30,269
But...

73
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,536
We can't leave out Jae-hyo.

74
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,811
Why...

75
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,482
on earth do you stick up for him?

76
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:55,618
Ah... all right, okay. I got it.

77
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,069
500 million each, ten billion in total.
I'll talk to my mom, but...

78
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:03,169
Do you think Song Jae-hyo
will readily agree to it?

79
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,703
I'll have to persuade him.

80
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,740
Scoot over.

81
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,736
We're all set, right? Let's get going.

82
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:23,336
What about the food?

83
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,603
Ah.

84
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:28,936
They were out of stock.
Completely sold out.

85
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,603
What are you doing?
Let's get going!

86
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,966
AUTOPSY ROOM

87
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:02,657
Uh...

88
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,969
Frankly speaking,

89
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,569
I'm not sure we can catch the perp.

90
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,703
There are no witnesses or CCTV cameras.

91
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:14,769
And all the hunters are covering
each other's backs.

92
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,569
As you must know, it's anything but easy.

93
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,461
So what are you suggesting?

94
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,320
We should just give up?

95
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,503
We don't know anything.

96
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,436
We don't know why she came all the way
here from Seoul, how she came here,

97
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,903
or why she had no belongings.

98
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,229
She's supposed to be studying at home,
and instead she's lying on that cold table

99
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,662
and yet we don't know a thing!

100
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,769
Jae-gyeong!

101
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,536
Only family members are allowed inside.

102
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,669
I just want to see her face. Please.

103
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,869
No, you're not allowed.

104
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,136
I just need to see her face.

105
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,136
-No.
-Please!

106
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,269
I said you're not allowed!

107
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,569
It's okay.

108
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:24,906
Jae-gyeong,

109
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:28,373
what happened?

110
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:40,536
Yeah, okay.

111
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,369
We checked the CCTV footage,

112
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,003
and Lee Jun-seong and Song Jae-hyo
are the culprits,

113
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,603
and it's true that Park Min-woo
was kidnapped by them.

114
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:50,570
Anything else?

115
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,669
We checked the internet history,

116
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:57,903
and they searched for burner cars
all last night until this morning.

117
00:11:57,903 --> 00:11:59,936
So they intend to change cars.

118
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,269
They're pretty smart, right?
These young punks--

119
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,056
That's great, then.

120
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,703
You stay here and search all
the used car dealers in the vicinity.

121
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,969
Each and every one.

122
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:15,169
Didn't you hear me?

123
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,136
Okay.

124
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:25,503
And we're going to go to Seoul right away.

125
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:58,076
USED CARS

126
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:11,703
Do we really have to do this?

127
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:15,269
We have no choice.
Car dealers are all a bunch of thugs.

128
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,969
I'll be outnumbered if I go alone.

129
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,903
Still, this is a bit...

130
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:22,885
It's only for a short while.

131
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,304
Step back.

132
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,812
What are you doing? Step back.

133
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:38,003
Stay in the car. I'm going in alone.

134
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:49,329
KOREAN RESTAURANT

135
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,219
Director's orders.

136
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,428
He wants us to back you up.

137
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,203
Enjoy.

138
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,969
Where is your father?

139
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,845
Did you come to collect money?

140
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,203
No.

141
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:56,103
Then why are you asking about my dad?

142
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:01,860
Because I don't see the owner anywhere.

143
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,693
A young girl like you couldn't possibly
be the owner.

144
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:12,303
Liar. People wearing clothes like that
don't eat at this place.

145
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,203
You caught me.

146
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:21,669
Have you heard from your brother?

147
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,436
Find him yourself and ask him.

148
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:27,669
A person's life is at stake!

149
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,536
My dad is in the hospital now
because of that prick!

150
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:33,703
He's in critical condition! Do you know?

151
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,489
ONE MILLION WON

152
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:47,803
Thank you for the meal.

153
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,336
Lee Jun-seong's father is in the hospital.

154
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,103
He's bound to call him.

155
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,436
Send me a car.

156
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:31,154
Mr. Cho had some business to attend to.

157
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,409
We will take you home.

158
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,069
I will take you home.

159
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,436
Hello.

160
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,269
How can I help you?

161
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,603
We came to look at a car.

162
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,103
What kind of car?

163
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,203
Uh...

164
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,436
A burner car.

165
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,703
Boss, Boss!

166
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:39,869
Oh, hello! What are you looking for?

167
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:44,147
Come in, come in. Come on in.

168
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,703
Wow, you're in luck.

169
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:58,403
We have the perfect car for you.

170
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:03,736
It's a 2007 van with only
300,000 kilometers on it.

171
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:06,736
Practically a new car.

172
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:15,536
So, how much do you want for it?

173
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:19,669
It's a bargain.
Including commission, it's 30 million won.

174
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,836
30 million won in cash?

175
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,269
Of course.

176
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:29,036
In return, we don't need
your ID or anything.

177
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:37,169
Isn't this what you wanted?

178
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,003
I'll grab the cash.

179
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,749
SEOUL GWANAK POLICE STATION

180
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:05,503
Hi, I'm from Homicide Unit Three.

181
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:08,021
I need a phone location
and an APB on a car.

182
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,836
Unit Three?

183
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:11,903
LEASE CONTRACT
NAME: SONG JAE-HYO

184
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,104
Your chief already processed this
through the system.

185
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,236
Ah...

186
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,236
We obtained additional information.

187
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:28,169
It was originally just a larceny case,
but drugs were found.

188
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:32,269
Ah.. is that so?

189
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,403
You can send the info just to me.

190
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,183
-Okay.
-Can you rush it, please?

191
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,869
It seems like you need a big car.

192
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:53,669
We have one, it's an Istana.
It's a palace on wheels.

193
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,869
Oh, I see.

194
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:59,669
We have a lot of sedans too.

195
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,269
Yeah, well...

196
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:06,664
-Hey! Our van's fucking gone!
-What?

197
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,736
I looked everywhere, but it's gone!

198
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:11,136
Shit!

199
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:27,903
See, it's gone.

200
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:30,036
Our van's gone!

201
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,503
Fuck.

202
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:34,203
I looked everywhere and it's gone!

203
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:36,303
Fuck, how is this possible?

204
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,203
Fucking shit.

205
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,703
I told you we had to kill
Park Min-woo, didn't I? Huh?

206
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:47,236
Those thugs, the thugs,

207
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:49,903
couldn't they have followed us here? Huh?

208
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:54,136
Otherwise, this doesn't make sense.
Ah, fuck!

209
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,836
Hold on... Damn it.

210
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,203
What do we do now?

211
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:04,636
What do we do? What are we going to do!?

212
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:06,769
Hold on, hold on!

213
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,436
The car key.

214
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,003
Who has the key?

215
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,436
Don't you have it?

216
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,769
I gave it to you last, didn't I?

217
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:19,603
Fuck.

218
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:26,569
You fucking dickhead!

219
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:29,769
How can the car move
when you have the fucking key!?

220
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,336
Hey, look at that!

221
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:41,303
Hey, hey! See that?

222
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:43,336
That prick took the van.

223
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,869
He can't have gone that far yet.

224
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,536
-Okay, okay.
-I'm going to get that asshole, okay?

225
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:50,336
Jae-hyo, come here for a sec.

226
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:51,569
Fucking let go of me.

227
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,869
-Jae-hyo, wait.
-Let go of me!

228
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:57,136
-Come here, damn it!
-Fucking let go!

229
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,603
You fucking asshole!

230
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,169
Get your shit together, Song Jae-hyo!

231
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,669
How can I when everything's screwed, huh?

232
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,803
My life is totally fucked!

233
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:13,336
It's fucked up!

234
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:16,503
Excuse me!

235
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,403
Isn't your car parked on the third floor?

236
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:24,469
You came down a floor
with our manager earlier, didn't you?

237
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,069
Damn it.

238
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:04,203
We're here, ma'am.

239
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:11,169
Yong-ho, you seem like a good person.

240
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:14,436
But...

241
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:20,191
if you want to kill me,

242
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:24,102
find my son first.

243
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:49,636
We'll do the job tonight.

244
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:53,503
I'll do it myself, so stay out of it.

245
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,636
It's the director's orders.

246
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:25,876
GAMBLER

247
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:31,369
-Yeah.
-We found the rats.

248
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,369
We confirmed the car model
and plate number.

249
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,003
They left here around ten minutes ago.

250
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:39,869
So I think we can
catch up to them in no time.

251
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,036
Wait for now.

252
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,324
Pardon?

253
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:46,293
If you send us backup, we can--

254
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:52,329
SEONGJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

255
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,069
How is everything at the restaurant?

256
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:59,603
Did you try calling Jun-seong?

257
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:02,303
<i>He's not picking up. You try.</i>

258
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:06,736
I'll be out of the hospital tomorrow,

259
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:09,370
so hang in there a little longer.

260
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,842
Tomorrow?

261
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,471
What are you talking about?
That's way too early.

262
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,263
I'm fine.

263
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,924
Let's talk again.

264
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,969
Is that you Jun-seong?

265
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:46,269
Who are you?

266
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:48,469
Are you Lee Jun-seong's father?

267
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,003
I'm with the police.

268
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:08,936
I need to use the restroom.

269
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:51,277
CONVENIENCE STORE

270
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,069
Wait, wait, wait.

271
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,214
Over here.

272
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:35,137
You can go here.

273
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:50,103
What is it?

274
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,569
How far are you going to take this?

275
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,736
I'll be outside.

276
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,936
Are you okay?

277
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,379
I kicked your leg earlier.

278
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,102
Is it okay?

279
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:38,803
Yeah.

280
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:45,936
And you?

281
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,703
I'm fine.

282
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,203
To be honest...

283
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:06,403
I'm super scared.

284
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:14,003
I'm scared that we might end up...

285
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,083
really killing Min-woo.

286
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,869
What about you?

287
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:29,403
When I was in the military,

288
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,703
you know what I kept thinking?

289
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,361
That I should've continued playing soccer.

290
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:42,869
Even if I was treated like shit,

291
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,103
I should have stuck it out.

292
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:53,203
Then I wouldn't have gambled

293
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:56,269
or be debt-ridden.

294
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,169
And my dad...

295
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:16,503
Maybe that's why...

296
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:19,635
I really...

297
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,982
just wanted to see you become a doctor.

298
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,971
You're right.

299
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,502
That woman...

300
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,290
We didn't kill her.

301
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,086
And it's right that it
was in self-defense for the guy.

302
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:44,594
But not Min-woo.

303
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,761
If we really kill Min-woo...

304
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:51,136
We really become murderers.

305
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:56,703
Jae-hyo.

306
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,086
Let's end it here.

307
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:12,436
We've really come too far.

308
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:16,336
We have to stop now.

309
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:30,003
Let's go back.

310
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,203
Huh?

311
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,648
What the hell?

312
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:52,469
Hey! Hey!

313
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,003
Damn it!

314
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,669
Hey!

315
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,736
Hey! Hey!

316
00:32:28,336 --> 00:32:30,003
Shit.

317
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,436
Fuck!

318
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,369
You asshole!

319
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:08,303
Fucking bastard.

320
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:11,069
Fucking let go, you bastard!

321
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:14,269
Hey! Hey!

322
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:16,036
Hey! You fucker!

323
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,936
Why are you flipping out and chasing me?

324
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,936
Are you crazy? Huh?

325
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,136
You're the fucking crazy one, bastard!

326
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:31,969
Honestly, what did I do
to you to deserve this?

327
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:35,969
I'm your friend too, aren't I?

328
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:39,069
Do I look like a pushover
to you, you bastard?

329
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:41,147
You put me in a fucking suitcase.

330
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:43,936
I told you I couldn't breathe, you fucker.

331
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,703
I couldn't breathe, you bastard!

332
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:48,136
Hey!

333
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:51,136
That's nothing. Now it's your turn.

334
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:53,469
