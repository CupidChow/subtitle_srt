1
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:17,029
At that moment,

2
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,651
a blurry memory resurfaced in my mind.

3
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,612

-Guys!

00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,332
-Mark him!
-Pass me the ball!

00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,794
-Go!
-Jae-hyo!

9
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:33,045
Over here!

10
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,256
-Hey!
-Stop him!

11
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:37,674
-Seriously?
-Come on!

12
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:42,471
-Get him!
-Hey!

13
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:44,765
-What's he doing?
-He's coming!

14
00:00:57,903 --> 00:00:59,237
What?

15
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:03,885
-What's wrong with him?
-Hey, Min-woo.

16
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,095
<i>That lanky goalie</i>

17
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:09,438
<i>was definitely Min-woo.</i>

18
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:10,829
-What's going on?
-What do we do?

19
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,456
-Move.
-Check if he's breathing.

20
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,082
<i>I remember it clearly.</i>

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,481
-<i>That's what happened then.</i>
-Check if he's breathing.

22
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,853
<i>I clearly remember it.</i>

23
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:21,674

NANGOK MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

25
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,563
Hey.

26
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:36,817
I don't remember that at all,

27
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,777
no matter how hard I think.

28
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,696
How is it that only you remember that?

29
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:42,656
Do you have solid proof?

30
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:45,492
I don't.

31
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:50,372
But I'm sure that it was Min-woo.

32
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:54,168
My memory is the proof.

33
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:55,961
Min-woo

34
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,255
is putting on an act right now.

35
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,549
He's putting on a show.

36
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:03,886
And you said yourself

37
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,971
that he had a sunstroke then.

38
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:10,476
Whether it was a sunstroke
or a panic attack doesn't matter now.

39
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:13,395
The same thing happened again.

40
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,189
You're not even a doctor yet, punk.

41
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,523
What?

42
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:29,411
Fine. Let's say you're right.

43
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,496
Let's assume that you're correct.

44
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,666
What do we do now?

45
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:37,127
I don't know.

46
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:38,963
Let's get him some medicine first.

47
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:42,800
You should've discussed it with me
if you had no idea.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,969
You didn't pick up the phone.

49
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,846
Was I just supposed to let him die?

50
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,973
That's not what I mean.

51
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:50,640
Then, what?

52
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:03,695
Min-woo saw our faces.

53
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,871
You...

54
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:14,873
still remember
how you promised not to hurt him,

55
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,459
right?

56
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,004
Sure. I do.

57
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:21,463
Of course, I do.

58
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:23,799
But,

59
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,968
the situation has changed now.

60
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:28,136
It's a whole new ball game.

61
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,517
Our hostage...

62
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:38,146
knows who his kidnappers are.

<i>Ripped and corrected by YoungJedi</i>

69
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,573
Could he be inside the house?

70
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,702
That's the only reasonable explanation.

71
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,412
No way.

72
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:18,538
Why didn't I think of that?

73
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:23,085
But here's what I don't get.

74
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:27,673
Why didn't the officers find him
if he was inside?

75
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:31,927
Why did they lie
and say it was just the two of them?

76
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,651
Die, you bastard.

77
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,837
Die!

78
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:50,922
Damn it!

79
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:57,786
That's possible, right?

80
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,496
I doubt it.

81
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,333
Are you saying that there's

82
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,168
a dead body in there?

83
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:06,003
Right in my building?

84
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:07,671
There might not be.

85
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,175
If they already dismembered him, that is.

86
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,821
Murder and dismemberment?

87
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,224
Gosh.

88
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,103
We should get going.

89
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:24,522
Where?

90
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,101
To report it.

I'm Kim Eun-jeong, an investigator
from the Financial Inspection Division.

93
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:01,517
Have you received any phone calls
from someone claiming to be

94
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:06,313
the Police, the Prosecutors' Office,
or any public or investigative agencies

95
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:08,148
as of late?

96
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,859
I beg your pardon?

97
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,610
In other words,

98
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,864
she wants to make sure
you aren't a target of a phishing scam.

99
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:22,746
That's not the case.

100
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,582
If so,

101
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:27,835
has someone blackmailed or threatened you

102
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:31,630
with abduction or kidnapping?

103
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:37,344
That's not the case either.

MEDICINE

105
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:42,766
Open up.

106
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:18,802
Seeing how you got me my medicine,

107
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:21,638
you must have no intention
of letting me go.

108
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,395
Jae-hyo.

109
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,103
Are you really going to
keep going with this?

110
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,152
Let me ask this one thing.

111
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:36,779
Why are you doing this?

112
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,197
You must have some sort of a reason.

113
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:43,661
We need money.

114
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,162
How much?

115
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,666
Half a billion won.

116
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,751
You asked my mom for 500 million won?

117
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,836
A billion, to be exact.

118
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,339
We'll split it in half.

119
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,341
You two punks have absolutely lost it.

120
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:58,675
Hey.

121
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,470
Why do you need that sort of money?

122
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,888
What's it for?

123
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,559
I can't tell you that.

124
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,144
All I can tell you is that he and I have--

125
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:10,562
I gambled

126
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:12,731
before I was drafted.

127
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:14,983
And he's about to be expelled.

128
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:27,746
-I'm really sorry, Min-woo.
-Forget it. Fuck. Don't apologize.

129
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,206
What good will it do now?

130
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,165
What's your plan?

131
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:33,794
Will you two really get my mom to pay up?

132
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,814
Yes.

133
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,801
You're seriously unhinged.

134
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,845
No, it's just that we're desperate.

135
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:45,598
Bullshit. Do all desperate people
turn to crime like this?

136
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:48,934
Don't rationalize your actions.
This is just who you are.

137
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,066
Anyhow.

138
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:00,880
When you get the money...

139
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:05,200
you'll let me go, right?

140
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:16,354
What's this? Why aren't you answering me?

141
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:21,008
What the heck is this?

142
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,344
Are you thinking of doing me in?

143
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:26,263
No, we wouldn't do something like that.

144
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:27,681
Absolutely not.

145
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:31,351
We just

146
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:33,812
need your word.

147
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,983
Promise us

148
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,402
that you'll let this slide.

149
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,114
That's it?

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,577
All right. If you let me go
after you get your money,

151
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,245
I'll let it all slide.

152
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:56,377
I mean it. I won't even say
or do anything until then.

153
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,462
That's what you want, right?

154
00:10:58,462 --> 00:10:59,880
That's right.

155
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,381
Okay. That's a deal.

156
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:04,134
Let me use the bathroom first.

157
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:06,929
And get me some food, too.

158
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,430
You want some food?

159
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:13,352
What? You have to feed me, don't you?

160
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:16,605
You've asked for a billion won.

161
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:18,732
That's the least you can do.

162
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:28,993
Mr. Cho.

163
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:30,119
I'm sorry I'm late.

164
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,746
I had a terrible time
finding a parking spot.

165
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:34,290
I'm really sorry.

166
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,166
-Any luck on his call logs?
-About that...

167
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,168
I looked into it,
but there wasn't anything.

168
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,504
All he had were
spam and telemarketing calls.

169
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:43,632
Other than that, it was just his mom.

170
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,509
What about the local merchants association?

171
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,760
Right.

172
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,889
The local gangs are
running the association.

173
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,099
It might cause us some trouble.

174
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,267
This is their turf, you see.

175
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:56,520
Let's go.

176
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:07,114
Mr. Cho.

177
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,218
Our men just arrived now.

178
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:11,761
Should I go get them?

179
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,539
I'll be back in a flash.

180
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,332
First floor.

181
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,346
"Youth Baseball Federation."

182
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,806
"Assistant Manager Cho Yong-ho."

183
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,851
Hold on.

184
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:37,478
You guys run a sports betting ring.

185
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,104
What brings you here?

186
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:41,106
Do you want to launder some money?

187
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,250
We don't do that here.

188
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,002
I'm looking for a shop.

189
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,503
What shop?

190
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:53,118
The shop this man visited

191
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:55,579
two days ago around 6 p.m.

192
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,249
It could be a pub or a restaurant,

193
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,709
but it's most likely a pub.

194
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,253
He's in his early twenties,

195
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,296
and he probably had company--

196
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,173
Hold on.

197
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:07,800
Are you saying

198
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,177
you want us to find someone?

199
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:14,056
Look here.

200
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:16,684
Do you have any idea
how many shops are in this area?

201
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:19,562
The merchants
must have a network of sorts.

202
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,188
Something like a group chat.

203
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:22,565
I get it.

204
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:25,650
You want me to upload his picture there?

205
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,279
Why would I?

206
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,821
I'll pay you.

207
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,453
My goodness.

208
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,873
Listen.

209
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:42,417
I don't know how much you earn
through your sports betting ring...

210
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:46,880
but you should be more careful.

211
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:51,252
YOUTH BASEBALL FEDERATION
ASSISTANT MANAGER CHO YONG-HO

212
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,514
I will pay you.

213
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,828
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

214
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,396
What?

215
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:03,898
"The last time"?

216
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,399
Guys.

217
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,483
Lock the door.

218
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,901
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,747
Where did he go?

220
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:30,216
You darned bastard!

221
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:31,592
I knew this would happen.

222
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:33,469
That way. Let's hurry.

223
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:34,803
Run!

224
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:39,182
What the hell?

225
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,004
My knee!

226
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:38,617
I'm going home.

227
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,035
I'll be back soon.

228
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:43,956
-What for?
-I need to get changed

229
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,041
and check on my place, too.

230
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,752
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

231
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:53,965
How did you know?

232
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,011
Know what?

233
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:00,597
That I'm about to be expelled.

234
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,849
How did you know that?

235
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:03,976
I followed you.

236
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,079
You were acting fishy, so I followed you.

237
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,414
Happy?

238
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:17,197
Then you must understand
how badly I need the money...

239
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,200
don't you?

240
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:24,662
We still haven't decided
what to do with him.

241
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:31,544
Jun-seong.

242
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,133
Do you think this problem will go away
if you keep putting it off?

243
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,510
And what if I don't?

244
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,722
We're out of options now.

245
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,389
What do you mean?

246
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:55,151
We have to kill him.

247
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,363
What?

248
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,826
Jun-seong.

249
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:05,912
There's a sedative
that's called amobarbital.

250
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:08,248
I can get it from the university hospital--

251
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,999
What are you even saying?

252
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,670
It won't be painful.

253
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:17,507
I'll do it.

254
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,384
Hey, Jae-hyo.

255
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:20,802
Come on.

256
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:22,930
This is Min-woo we're talking about.

257
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,683
The same Min-woo
who drank with us just two nights ago.

258
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:28,727
Yes. I know that.

259
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:31,396
If you did, you wouldn't be saying this.

260
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,649
Do you really believe

261
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:38,278
what he said about letting it slide
if we set him free

262
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,113
after getting the money?

263
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,991
"All right. Thanks."

264
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,619
"Here is half a billion for each of you."

265
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,871
"You let me live, after all."

266
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,290
"Enjoy your new lives with that money."

267
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,708
Do you seriously believe him?

268
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,045
Hey.

269
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,883
What do you take him for?

270
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,219
What do you mean?

271
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:04,554
Answer me.

272
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:07,640
What do you take him for?

273
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,062
A hostage.

274
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:15,398
No, Jae-hyo. You're wrong!

275
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,151
He may be a hostage now,
but he was our friend first.

276
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:20,028
That's why we can't do it. No way.

277
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:22,364
Fuck. Then what do you expect me to do?

278
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,782
I have absolutely no idea!

279
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,787
For fuck's sake...

280
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,664
Jae-hyo.

281
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:32,707
Get him something to eat.

282
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:34,417
Make sure to feed him

283
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,207
and call me if anything happens.

284
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:37,667
I'm off.

285
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,927
POLICE

286
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,983
He must have left somehow.

287
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,818
Through where?

288
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:02,028
You said you took a look inside.

289
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:03,446
Exactly.

290
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,449
I clearly remember seeing
just two men there.

291
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,287
Su-an.

292
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:14,499
As you know, we get noise complaints
five to six times a day.

293
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:18,253
We had to respond to
about 20 such cases just last night.

294
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:21,214
And yet, I remember
what happened that night clearly.

295
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:23,216
Do you know why?

296
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,760
Because I fired my taser.

297
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,179
There were definitely just two of them.

298
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:32,100
I've heard that my partner
told you the same thing.

299
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,645
But there are clearly
three men in the video.

300
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,315
I'm sorry,

301
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:39,916
but if you want to report it,

302
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,736
bring me some concrete evidence.

303
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,821
All you have now is speculation.

304
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,990
It's more than that.
This is a reasonable doubt.

305
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,658
Gosh.

306
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:50,577
Bring me solid proof.

307
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:52,245
Get going.

308
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,456
Officer Kang Seong-min
of Namseo Police Station speaking.

309
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,166
How may I help you?

310
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,875
-Yes.
-Unbelievable.

311
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:01,879
Welcome.

312
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,258
It's so hot.

313
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:06,801
It's so hot.

314
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:11,514
My fingers almost got cooked.

315
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:17,187
By the way,

316
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:19,981
I do understand why he said that.

317
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:24,861
Think about it. He can't just
file a report based on our word.

318
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:27,530
They can't make any moves
without any evidence.

319
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,034
Do you need a bag?

320
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,705
Here.

321
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:03,357
Maybe this isn't the place.

322
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:09,697
He came back around 12:35 a.m.,

323
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,076
so let's check the video from 12:10 a.m.

324
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:14,869
Stop. There he is.

325
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:21,417
-Gosh.
-They should have had a camera there.

326
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:25,880
That's the stationery section.

327
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,633
He bought ten rolls of green tape,
nine rolls of duct tape,

328
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:30,760
and all the cable ties we had.

329
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:34,556
I remember because he stormed in
and took everything on the shelf.

330
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,683
We never get customers like that.

331
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:37,976
That aside,

332
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:40,686
is this really for
an official investigation?

333
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,272
Of course.

334
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,110
Cheol.

335
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,695
Your mother

336
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,530
has the master key, right?

337
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:55,816
MR. KIM OF ORYUGOL

338
00:21:57,704 --> 00:22:00,123
We received a report.

339
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,739
I THINK HE WAS AT MY SHOP.

340
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,629
I think we where he went.

341
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:10,759
How are things going?

342
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,594
It's smooth sailing so far.

343
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,888
I've figured out where he was abducted.

344
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:16,097
I think I'll be able to find him soon.

345
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:19,183
That's not the point.
I'm asking about his mother.

346
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,271
His mother, sir?

347
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:25,148
You're so slow.

348
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:26,858
Listen closely.

349
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:30,862
I didn't put you up to this
just so you can find her kid.

350
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:34,115
Your assignment
is to keep an eye on the mother.

351
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:35,200
Understood, sir.

352
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,203
That kid doesn't matter to us.

353
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:40,830
What matters is his mother.

354
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,832
That crazy cow.

355
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:54,875
ORYUGOL BBQ

356
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:01,810
The place doesn't have
any security cameras,

357
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,854
and they seem to have used cash.

358
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:06,565
Also, just as you suggested,

359
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:08,400
the three of them seemed to be friends.

360
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,818
They were around the same age.

361
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:11,194
He doesn't know where they went?

362
00:23:11,194 --> 00:23:13,405
No, the owner doesn't know
where they went,

363
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:16,616
but one of them
was wearing a varsity jacket.

364
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:19,494
-I see.
-It apparently said Sungjin University.

365
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:21,663
So?

366
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:24,082
Shall we comb the campus?

367
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,692
NOTICE

368
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,694
Mr. Lee Jun-seong.

369
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:01,745
You pricks!

370
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:04,039
Wait. I might really fall.

371
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,666
Shit. I'll pay you.

372
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,209
You idiot.

373
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,796
I let you go so you could get my money.

374
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:14,341
Where the hell were you?

375
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:15,467
Do you think this is a joke?

376
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,010
No, I don't.

377
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,511
Be honest.

378
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:20,388
You were trying to run, right?

379
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:21,766
Did you come to get your stuff?

380
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:23,266
No, I wasn't.

381
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:25,143
I swear.

382
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:26,477
Then what?

383
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:31,232
Where were you yesterday
and the day before?

384
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:34,819
Spill it.

385
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:36,446
Wait.

386
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:38,657
I was at my dad's restaurant.

387
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:40,075
That's a load of bullshit.

388
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:42,035
I ought to just...

389
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:44,245
Guys, throw him over.

390
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:49,000
Wait. Just a second.

391
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:55,465
What are you guys doing?

392
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:01,304
He must have lost it.

393
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:02,764
I'll pay you back.

394
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:05,808
I'm going to pay you back, you bastards!

395
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:08,603
-Stop it!
-Hey.

396
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:12,107
Hey.

397
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:14,150
Damn it.

398
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,058
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

399
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,072
You don't have to pay me back.

400
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:22,241
It's easier to just cripple you
and harvest your organs.

401
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:25,161
When you get the money,

402
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,538
you'll let me go, right?

403
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:28,164
If you let me go after you get your money,

404
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:29,374
I'll let it all slide.

405
00:25:29,374 --> 00:25:32,919
You just want me to keep still
until you get your money, right?

406
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,296
I'll do that.

407
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:35,213
That's right.

408
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:36,756
Okay. That's a deal.

409
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,634
I'm telling you the truth.

410
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:43,555
I'll make big money in a few days!

411
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,972
"Big money"?

412
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,809
What money?

413
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:50,353
Who's going to give you money?

414
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:52,105
What idiot would do that?

415
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:25,596
Never mind.

416
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,354
Enjoying your meal?

417
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:36,441
Sure.

418
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:41,696
I need to ask you something.

419
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:46,326
When you promised us you'd let it slide,

420
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:47,660
did you mean it?

421
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,790
What's wrong? You don't trust me?

422
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,560
I do.

423
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,936
I trust you.

424
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:56,127
I sure do.

425
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:57,587
Why wouldn't I?

426
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:01,591
Why did you ask, then?

427
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:03,676
Just because.

428
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:05,887
I was curious.

429
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,975
Dig in.

430
00:27:15,522 --> 00:27:16,731
Isn't there any more?

431
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,666
You should've
cooked two portions, not one.

432
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,277
That was all I had.

433
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:21,961
Get me some rice, then.

434
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:23,798
I don't have any, cooked or uncooked.

435
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:27,510
How can you not?
Then give me some more of the soup.

436
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:25,091
Thank goodness
it wasn't a stir-fry noodle.

437
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,352
You son of a bitch!

438
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,734
What now, you bastard?

439
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,861
-Come here, fuck.
-Let me go, you bastard!

440
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:46,363
Let go, you prick!

441
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:48,197
Let me go!

442
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,326
Damn it.

443
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:53,327
You bastard...

444
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,791
Come get some!

445
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,751
He must have lost it.

446
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,771
Stop!

447
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,884
Judging from the camera footage,

448
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:10,053
one of them seems to have gone out.

449
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:12,472
But I think that medical student
is still inside.

450
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:16,893
Hey, open up.

451
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,895
Open up the fucking door!

452
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:20,396
Min-woo!

453
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:26,111
Min-woo. I told you to open up.

454
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,737
Open up!

455
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:33,201
-Open the door.
-This place is a dump.

456
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:35,036
Open up, you prick!

457
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:37,664
Fuck.

458
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,500
Just wait until I get my hands on you.

459
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,168
Fucking bastard!

460
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,808
Gosh.

461
00:29:57,976 --> 00:29:59,144
Min-woo.

462
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:02,230
Just wait, you bastard!

463
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,620
You'll let me go after you get the money?

464
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,664
Bullshit. Do they think I'm a pushover?

465
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,830
Come on, you bastard!

466
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:02,642
You never should have messed with me.

467
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:05,311
Jae-hyo...

468
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,483
What's gotten into you?

469
00:32:11,151 --> 00:32:13,528
This isn't who you are.

470
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:18,032
You carried me on your back...

471
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,120
and even took me to the school nurse.

472
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,372
Are you okay, Min-woo?

473
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:25,957
-Min-woo.
-Wake up!

474
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,004
You saved my life.

475
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,681
That wasn't me, you idiot.

476
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,136
HEATING, REPAIRS

477
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:35,521
What's all this?

478
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:40,921
Hold still.

479
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,014
CHEOL

480
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,632
Damn it! Just hold still!

481
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:04,652
Damn it.

482
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:09,741
Hey!

483
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,534
Hey!

484
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:13,912
You son of a bitch!

485
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,747
What do you think you're doing?

486
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:23,296
Look at this.

487
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,799
He did this to me.

488
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,259
What?

489
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:28,301
Min-woo did that?

490
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:30,595
-That's right.
-I didn't.

491
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:33,473
I'll keep him alive like you said,
so don't stop me.

492
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:34,474
Wait, Jae-hyo!

493
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,976
-Wait!
-Jun-seong!

494
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:38,228
-He's going to kill me! Help!
-Let go, you punk!

495
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:40,188
-Let go!
-Fuck.

496
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:41,231
Damn it.

497
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:43,608
-He'll kill me!
-They're insane.

498
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:44,901
Stop, Jae-hyo!

499
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:47,070
Please!

500
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,907
Please, Jae-hyo...

501
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:52,367
-Hold on.
-Please, Jun-seong.

502
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,535
-He'll freaking kill me!
-Stop!

503
00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:54,452
Get off me!

504
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,538
Let go of me!

505
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:58,873
Jae-hyo. Please don't do this!

506
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,542
Stop, you idiot!

-Jae-hyo!
-Get off me, you bastard!

513
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:13,221
-Jun-seong. Please stop him!
-Come on, Jae-hyo!

514
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:15,015

00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:40,581
The money!

Let's make a ten billion won!

521
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,555
Half a billion is chump change.

522
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:57,015
I'll help you make billions.

523
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,516
Hey, you two.

524
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,101
You need money, right?

525
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,811
You said you were desperate.

526
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:04,397

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,322
Jae-hyo...

529
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:14,282
I'm not lying.

530
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:15,450
Jae-hyo.

531
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,786
Just hear me out.

532
00:39:17,786 --> 00:39:19,329
You can decide what to do with me after.

533
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:22,332
Jae-hyo, please.

534
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:23,670
