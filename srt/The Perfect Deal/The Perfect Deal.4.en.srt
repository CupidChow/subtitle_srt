1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,497
My late father was the founder
of a huge investment company.

2
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,497
He invested a ginormous amount of money.

3
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:20,164
A mind-boggling amount.

4
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:26,364
Right before he died,
he took me somewhere.

5
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,797
I'd never been there before.

6
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,397
It was some kind of storage container.

7
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:47,197
My dad told me a lot of
surprising things that day.

8
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,930
He said that our company was involved
in illegal activities.

9
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,030
At that moment... I realized.

10
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,130
I was standing...

11
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,030
in my dad's secret safe.

12
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,697
There was a ton of money.

13
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,430
Like tens of billions of won.

14
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:21,364
I'd never seen so many yellow bills
piled up like that

15
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,730
in my entire life.

16
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:29,264
I touched the money with my own hands.

17
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,397
Billions, no, tens of billions.

18
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,797
I'll give you that money.

19
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,164
Money that no one knows exists.

20
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,297
You mean... instead of 500 million,

21
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:52,764
we'll get 10 billion?

22
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,397
There could be even more.

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,330
I guarantee it.

24
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,064
You said your dad suddenly died
of a heart attack.

25
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:07,830
Well, he had prior symptoms.

26
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,464
His health was going downhill.

27
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,530
What a load of bull.
This punk is lying.

28
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,730
Jae-hyo, why would I lie
in this situation?

29
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,130
Fuck off, you bastard!

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,397
You think you can dupe me twice?

31
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:23,130
Didn't you say you would stay quiet
until we get the money, huh?

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,830
Jjapagetti, you prick! Argh...

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,964
Doesn't that mean
we don't have to kill him?

34
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,330
It would be like
the kidnapping never happened.

35
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:36,597
What?

36
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:40,755
As if he staged it.

37
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:44,022
Right! That's what I'm saying! Yes!

38
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:48,522
If we split that money,
we all become accomplices.

There are actually
storage containers there.

60
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:35,255
His story checks out.

61
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,455
So?

62
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:41,922
If you have the time,
maybe we should go check it out.

63
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:48,555
I have a morning class.

00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,255
Hey, we're in this together.

65
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:53,255
Who says I won't help?

66
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:55,722
You want me to ditch class then?

67
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:16,788
How did it go?

68
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:24,188
What did Jae-hyo say?
Is he willing to accept my offer?

69
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,188
You're not lying, are you?

70
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,788
The money is really stored there, right?

71
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:47,755
Absolutely! I'm a terrible liar.

72
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:00,188
You better not be playing with us.

73
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,988
Or you'll pay dearly for it.

74
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,255
Yeah.

75
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,755
Back inside.

76
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,188
Yeah.

77
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:24,488
Ah.

78
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,055
-Okay?
-Yes.

79
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:34,022
Thanks.

80
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:56,455
They both went out. You can relax.

81
00:08:57,222 --> 00:09:00,722
Okay, let's try and put this all together.

82
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:03,188
So you're saying those two punks

83
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,188
have someone locked up?

84
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:09,155
Yeah, and they said
if they split the money

85
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:12,388
they won't have to kill him.

86
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:15,655
Accomplices to a staged kidnapping?

87
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,022
Not 500 million won, but tens of billions?

88
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:23,655
Excuse me!

89
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:30,688
We witnessed a kidnapping last night.

90
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,822
Okay, I will get in touch, sir.

91
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:36,588
-Good.
-Thank you.

92
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,555
Huh?

93
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:40,055
Hello.

94
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,622
What are you doing here?

95
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:51,922
You witnessed what?

96
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:54,055
Kidnapping? Where?

97
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,488
Neighbor.

98
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:58,355
The house in front?

99
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,822
They have someone locked up to be exact,

100
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,855
but it could escalate to murder.

101
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:03,855
It's pretty serious.

102
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:05,222
Hold on.

103
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:09,088
How did you find out? Any evidence?

104
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:13,088
I went inside the house
with Cheol's mom's master key.

105
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:15,022
The other day, I heard

106
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:17,355
loud fighting from the house
and called the police.

107
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:20,322
The cops came and checked it out,
but they said

108
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:23,022
they only saw two people
when I know there are three.

109
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,955
So you entered someone else's house?
Without permission?

110
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:28,422
Two guys have a kid locked up.

111
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,688
Whatever it is, don't your actions
constitute a crime too?

112
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,922
I know, of course I know!

113
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:37,288
But should I just sit back
when the cops won't do anything?

114
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:38,488
Hey, Cha Su-an.

115
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,555
What?

116
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,222
Don't you have an interview coming up?

117
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:44,922
Shouldn't you be focusing on that

118
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,955
instead of wasting your time like this?

119
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:49,122
At this rate, you'll fail again!

120
00:10:49,122 --> 00:10:50,355
What?

121
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,922
You sure have a way
of getting to me like this.

122
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:55,688
Yeah, you're so smart,
you passed in a year

123
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,055
-and dumb me is still an aspiring cop.
-Hey, that's--

124
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:01,488
But I refuse to be irresponsible like you.

125
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:04,988
If that's what cops are like,
then I don't want to be one!

126
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,988
Why don't you save that
for after you become a cop?

127
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,755
The station was asking
when you're coming in.

128
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:27,522
I'm heading over there.

129
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:34,688
But first, can I take a look
at the dispatch records?

130
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:40,855

Who are you?

141
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:57,855
You should've come straight to the office
if you wanted to get a quote.

142
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,988
I'm sorry.

143
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,922
This place is huge.

144
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:04,322
I lost my way.

145
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:08,055
You think I didn't see you
sneaking in through the back?

146
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,988
What?

147
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:12,322
Forget it. What is it you want to store?

148
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:16,255
FYI, we don't take any illegal stuff.

149
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,788
Of course, it's nothing like that.

150
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,355

151
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,522
hats, shoes...

152
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:28,988
Okay, let's see. The rate is...

153
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,755
Uh, sir,

154
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,788
is it also possible to store

155
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,822
personal items in there?

156
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,488
Like what?

157
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,855
-Drugs?
-No, no.

158
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,322
It's nothing like that.

159
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:03,622
I mean, something like...

160
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,888
a safe.

161
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:13,767
Sure, a lot of people do that.

162
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:14,755
Really?

163
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:17,155
That container you were looking at.

164
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:19,688
The customer is using it as a safe.

165
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,355

168
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:28,722
<i>Yes.</i>

169
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,355
<i>You came alone, right?</i>

170
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,422
<i>Yes.</i>

171
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:43,755
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

172
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,522
<i>How can I make you believe me?</i>

173
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,155
<i>Prove it.</i>

174
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,988
<i>Get on the train that's coming in.</i>

175
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,079
THIS TRAIN: BOUND FOR SEONGSU,
WILL ARRIVE IN 6 MINUTES

176
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:57,766
NEXT TRAIN: NONE

177
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,022
<i>Get on the opposite train.</i>

178
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,222
<i>If you don't, Min-woo will die.</i>

179
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,888
Hey!

180
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,155
-What?
-Get out of the way!

181
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,988
No! No, no!

182
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,288
Hurry, hurry. Move!

183
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:35,055
Move! Get out of the way!

184
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:51,688
<i>Did you make it?</i>

185
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:55,055
<i>Yes.</i>

186
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:57,488
<i>Get off at the next station.</i>

187
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:03,988
<i>But you must get off from the first door
of the first car.</i>

188
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,488
<i>1-1.</i>

189
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,888
<i>Transfer to Line 1 at this station.</i>

190
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:36,222
<i>You must go to Jongno 3-ga Station.</i>

191
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:52,322
<i>Go to Yaksu Station.
Transfer to Line 3.</i>

192
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:06,322
<i>I'm changing the location.
Take Line 5 to Singil Station.</i>

193
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:20,755
<i>The train is arriving soon.
You're going to miss it.</i>

194
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:23,155
<i>You'd better hurry or Min-woo will die.</i>

195
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:41,988
<i>At Singil, transfer to Line 1.</i>

196
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,350
ARRIVE AT BAKSEON STATION, 12:35 P.M.

197
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,388
<i>Wait for my text at Bakseon Station.</i>

198
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,155
<i>Have you arrived?</i>

199
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,788
<i>Yes.</i>

200
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:50,188
<i>Put the bag on the rack in the next train
and get off.</i>

201
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:56,422
<i>The train bound for Dongincheon
is now approaching.</i>

202
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:21,122
<i>Did you leave the bag on the train?</i>

203
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,355
Hello?

204
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:23,155
<i>Why didn't you do as I ordered?</i>

205
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:27,788
Answer me.

206
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:35,188
There's no guarantee you'll let my son
live after you get the money.

207
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,355
You want Min-woo to die?

208
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:42,394
If my son dies,
that will be your death sentence!

209
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,355
Answer me.

210
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:50,955
<i>You're watching me right now, aren't you?</i>

211
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:56,022
Listen carefully.

212
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:58,955
Without proof that my son is alive,

213
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:03,055
you can kiss the money goodbye. Got it?

214
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:07,488
<i>Min-woo is still alive.</i>

215
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:09,388
<i>You can have my word on that.</i>

216
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,855
I don't need your word, I want proof!
Give me proof!

217
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,755
<i>One more thing.</i>

218
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:21,722
If you so much as harm a single hair
on my son's head,

219
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:25,488
you're all dead meat. Understand?

220
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:56,122
<i>The train bound for Dongducheon
is now approaching.</i>

221
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,088
Yes, we found her.

222
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:26,122
We didn't spot the abductor.

223
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:31,555
Over here!

224
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:37,955
Okay, I'll call. Yes, thank you.

225
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,569
FOUND IT, FOUND IT

226
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:49,755
HEY HEY

227
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,155
Geez, why isn't he reading my texts?

228
00:25:12,155 --> 00:25:16,455
You told me I should go to the police,
so why stop me now?

229
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:21,422
I first met your husband 20 years ago.

230
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:24,188
His company, Woonam Corp,

231
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,022
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

232
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:30,255
You think I have the luxury
to listen to your old stories?

233
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:37,322
We resuscitated his company

234
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:41,622
by using it as a money laundering machine

235
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:44,155
for our organization.

236
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,355
Of course, we also benefited.

237
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:02,355
We have grown into a huge supermarket

238
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:04,822
doing business in China
and Southeast Asia.

239
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:10,755
Both our businesses were able to flourish

240
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:13,588
because of the pact of secrecy

241
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:16,055
we had kept.

242
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,688
So when you threatened me,

243
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:20,722
asking for my help,

244
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:24,422
I immediately sent Mr. Cho
to help you out.

245
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:27,948
I was afraid you would divulge our secret.

246
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:33,422
I know how painful and distressing
this must be for you.

247
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:38,122
But involving the police
is out of the question.

248
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:40,455
Once the police investigation starts,

249
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:43,088
it will bring Woonam into the spotlight.

250
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:46,155
No matter how hard we try

251
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,355
to keep a lid on our secret,

252
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:54,288
it will put our business at risk.

253
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,588
We will find your son no matter what.

254
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:00,422
If he comes back dead,

255
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:04,855
we will inflict the same suffering
on those responsible.

256
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:11,022
You expect me to trust you and wait
when our trust has already been broken?

257
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,888
Just as your son is precious to you,

258
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:18,888
this business is more precious
to me than my life.

259
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,188
Move.

260
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:39,388
We need the names of the friends your son
has been hanging out with recently.

261
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:41,188
I said move.

262
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,888
Reunion.

263
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:56,088
He went to a high school reunion
a few times.

264
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:04,155
I'll give you three days.
Bring back my son by then.

265
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:05,855
Alive.

266
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:22,522
Hey!

267
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:26,555
What's up? You didn't answer my texts.

268
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,922
Why did you call me out here?

269
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:33,455
It's this place.

270
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,955
What is?

271
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:37,322
This is where I made the call
to Min-woo's mom.

272
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:42,055
I made the call here early this morning.

273
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,788
I told her to bring one billion won.

274
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:48,655
And I went to pick up the money today.

275
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,355
What the fuck?

276
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,022
Without even telling me?

277
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,522
So...

278
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:00,188
how did it go?

279
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,855
I did everything as planned.

280
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:05,022
Made her transfer from
one subway line to another.

281
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:06,522
So did you get it?

282
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:11,523
No, I didn't.

283
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:14,023
Damn it. Why?

284
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:19,755
Everything went
according to plan at first.

285
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:21,855
But, fuck, at the last minute...

286
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:24,788
Min-woo's mom refused to listen to me.

287
00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:29,622
She said she would hand over the money
only after proof that Min-woo is alive.

288
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:37,022
I think there is someone behind this.

289
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:39,255
I saw people following her.

290
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:41,622
They were watching her from a distance.

291
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,522
Cops? Did you get caught?

292
00:29:44,522 --> 00:29:47,322
No, that's not it.

293
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:50,588
Damn it. I don't know. Ah...

294
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:56,004
I'm sure they didn't see me.

295
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:59,944
So only you saw them?
You think that makes sense, huh?

296
00:29:59,944 --> 00:30:01,922
Damn you, you prick.

297
00:30:01,922 --> 00:30:05,155
Hey! What are you doing, huh?

298
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:06,822
What are you doing!?

299
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:09,355
We're fucked, you idiot.

300
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,088
What are you doing...

301
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:13,222
-Jun-seong.
-Damn you.

302
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:14,355
Jun-seong, hear me out.

303
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,888
Fucking let go.

304
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:20,422
It didn't work out this time
because I went there alone.

305
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:23,622
You and I together, we can persuade her,
we can coerce her.

306
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,588
While I deal with Min-woo's mom, you can
take photos and videos in real time.

307
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:29,922
Cut the bullshit, you bastard!

308
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:34,655
This is all because you let
Min-woo go. Isn't it?

309
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,355
Isn't it because you let Min-woo go?

310
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:38,988
You're trying to pin it on me?

311
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:40,955
You're the one who wanted
to kidnap Min-woo.

312
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:44,955
So, damn it, we don't need to fight.

313
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:48,822
If we want to live, we have no choice...

314
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,355
but to kill him.

315
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,688
Fuck.

316
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:01,822
How did you stoop so low?

317
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:06,222
Then what the fuck am I
supposed to do, huh?

318
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:08,488
What should I do?

319
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:12,255
Hey, you think my parents
are doing well abroad?

320
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:15,222
I haven't fucking heard from them in ages.

321
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,233
Jun-seong.

322
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:25,188
Please, I'm begging you.

323
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:28,522
I really need that money.
Without it, I'm dead.

324
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:31,788
My life will be over. So, please...

325
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:35,955
I'm begging you.

326
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:39,119
Get lost.

327
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:45,922
Fuck!

328
00:31:55,554 --> 00:31:58,261
DAD

329
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:01,822
What?

330
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,655
Mi-ae.

331
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:29,022
What happened?

332
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,955
Why is Dad getting surgery suddenly?

333
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:42,422
The doctor said his stomach is all rotten.

334
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:47,822
Apparently, his organs were removed
by a quack.

335
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:50,288
You hear me?

336
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:55,588
When? Why?

337
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:59,555
What do you think? To pay off
your gambling debt, you bastard.

338
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:05,455
After you ran off to the army,

339
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:10,355
do you know how much
the debt collectors harassed us?

340
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,430
Get lost. I don't want to see your face.

341
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,355
Get lost!

342
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:37,055
Take care of yourself.

343
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:40,022
And make sure to call.

344
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,075
Yeah, okay.

345
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,122
I'm going.

346
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:57,222
Jun-seong!

347
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:22,488
I'll take care of the debt.

348
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:27,255
So don't worry and look after yourself.

349
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:32,055
Just stay healthy.
That is what's most important.

350
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:39,922
Son!

351
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,288
I love you.

352
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,888
Bye.

353
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:43,922
When I was serving in the army...

354
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:48,722
there was one thing I vowed.

355
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,288
What is it?

356
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:55,522
I vowed never

357
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,555
to let my dad down again.

358
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,155
That I'd live a new life

359
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:08,422
after I was discharged.

360
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,422
Guess I'm screwed from the start.

361
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:19,588
I didn't know, but my life
is fucked up anyway.

362
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:30,922
I'm sorry.

363
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:35,522
No, it's not your fault.

364
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,455
I made the choices.

365
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:50,088
Jae-hyo.

366
00:36:52,455 --> 00:36:54,022
If...

367
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:59,888
we do as Min-woo says,
but it turns out to be a hoax,

368
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:07,122
let's go with your original plan then.

369
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:11,922
I won't stop you.
I won't get in your way.

370
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:19,322
Please, Jae-hyo, just think it over.

371
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:22,222
That's the best option in this situation.

372
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,588
Jae-hyo.

373
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:37,555
Jae-hyo, I...

374
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:43,422
I really don't want to disappoint
my dad anymore.

375
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:49,088
So can you do as I say, just this once?

376
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:54,755
If you go along with me, then...

377
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:59,022
I will do anything you ask me from now on.

378
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:00,955
Huh?

379
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:02,488
Huh? Jae-hyo.

380
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,188
Please, Jae-hyo.

381
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:20,488
Is three days enough?

382
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:26,455
Answer me.

383
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,488
I only have three days.

384
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:35,822
No, two is enough.

385
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:38,622
How is that?

386
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,022
I have a plan.

387
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:26,188
Let's do it.

388
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:27,955
Let's fucking do it.

389
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:37,922
Anyone home?

390
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,382
