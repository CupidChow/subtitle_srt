00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:14,752
Jun-seong.

2
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:24,095
Do you take me for a pushover?

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,897
<i>One winter day
when I was in middle school...</i>

4
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,527
I had this conversation with my parents.

5
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:41,028
Min-woo.

6
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,825
You may not have realized it,

7
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:49,287
but you were born into a family

8
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:51,790
that is more wealthy than others.

9
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,335
That's why you get to live
in a fine house in a nice neighborhood

10
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,880
and attend great schools
surrounded by good people.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,757
But,

12
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:03,634
this world isn't just full of good people.

13
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:06,053
In this world...

14
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:13,103
There are a hundred times more
bad people than good...

15
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,229
No. A thousand times more.

16
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,482
Really?

17
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:21,903
That is why

18
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:24,239
I've decided to send you
to a regular high school.

19
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,365
Gosh, it's hot.

20
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:26,825
-This is so delicious.
-It's good.

21
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,744
Is your dad really a chairman, Min-woo?

22
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:32,622
-No.
-Hey, don't lie!

23
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,165
-We've heard everything.
-Don't lie.

24
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:35,709
What are you, then?

25
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,044
-Your family must be loaded.
-I'll have one more, Min-woo.

26
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:40,839
-Can we have more sundae and tteokbokki?
-Don't we have some left?

27
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,382
Things will be

28
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:44,801
completely different there.

29
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:47,929
Your classmates
might even attack you at times.

30
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:50,223
Min-woo.

31
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,058
Where have you been?

32
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:54,185
-The first floor.
-I see.

33
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,937
Can you lend me 30,000 won?

34
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:57,814
I'll pay you back.

35
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:00,233
Being wealthier than others

36
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:03,236
doesn't mean
that you have to be giving all the time.

37
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,697
-You need 30,000 won?
-Yes.

38
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:10,785
If someone tries
to take advantage of your wealth,

39
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,454
you must show them

40
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:15,456
that you're not to be messed with.

41
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:23,506
But who are you?

42
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,261
Dealing with such people

43
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,513
toughened me up bit by bit.

44
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,935
Here's one thing
that you must always keep in mind.

45
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:40,022
Don't ever let anyone push you around.

People rarely get a perfect score
on the fitness test.

63
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,960
You must have worked hard.

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,089
You've been preparing for it for so long,

65
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:30,425
so I'm not worried about your interview.

66
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:33,303
-Are you still doing the community patrol?
-Yes.

67
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,181
You'll get extra points
for mentioning that during your interview

68
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:39,309
since that's also a part of police work.

69
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:42,228
I've been reviewing
the previous interview questions,

70
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,314
but the group interview worries me.

Doesn't he give you any pointers?

73
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,153
He wouldn't have any.

74
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:52,822
-I don't expect much from him.
-Why not?

75
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:56,031
They never should have accepted him
in the first place.

It's been a while, ma'am.

To what do I owe this pleasure?

00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,239
My son...

has been kidnapped.

138
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:11,497
Your best course of action

139
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:14,208
would be to report it to the police

140
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,420
or to hire a competent
private investigator.

141
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,381
I could introduce you to someone
if you'd like.

142
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:24,802
That'd be the only thing
I could do for you.

143
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:27,639
One more thing.

144
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,309
Don't ever come to see me again like this

145
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,686
over something that isn't business-related.

146
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,065
I'm warning you.

147
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:42,903
Give my regards to your late husband.

148
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:52,246
Shouldn't I be the one
issuing such a warning?

149
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:59,295
If that's an ultimatum,
I should be the one giving it to you.

150
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,882
If you don't help me,

151
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,386
I'll go to the police directly.

152
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,971
I'll tell them

153
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:10,598
that the director
of the Youth Baseball Federation

154
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:13,518
runs an illegal sports betting operation

155
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:16,979
and that we're working together.

156
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,732
I'll tell them everything.

157
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,156
Are you threatening me now?

158
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,618
Not at all.

159
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:32,704
I'm giving you an order.

160
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,706
The choice is yours to make.

161
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:36,583
You could either go down

162
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,294
with a mother who has lost her son

163
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:40,836
or not.

164
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,392
Get the details of her son and handle it

165
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,855
before that cow loses it
and spills the beans.

00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,252
HEAVIER SENTENCE TO BE EXPECTED
FOR KIDNAPPERS OF MINORS

168
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:13,953
Damn it.

169
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,085
Where are you going?

170
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,711
I have classes.

171
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,674
Now?

172
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,886
What about it?

173
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,512
What's different now?

174
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:36,768
He knows everything.

175
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:38,895
How will you handle it?

176
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:42,690
He might suspect us for now,

177
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,151
but he'll believe us in time.

178
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,406
Jun-seong.

179
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,159
When it comes to humans,

180
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,204
our emotions trump reason at all times.

181
00:11:57,204 --> 00:12:00,667
That's how our brains are programmed.

182
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,460
What I'm saying is,

183
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,587
even if he suspects us now,

184
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:07,339
he'll buy our story sooner or later.

185
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:11,802
Does that mean...

186
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:15,056
he won't know that it's us?

187
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,557
Exactly.

188
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,478
Damn it.

189
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,858
Why do you have to be so logical?

190
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:29,737
So?

191
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:32,073
When will you get his mom to pay up?

192
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:36,995
Let's wait for a few days.

193
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:40,039
I'm sure she's in a dilemma right now too.

194
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,540
What sort of dilemma?

195
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,253
Whether to report it to the police or not.

196
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,671
That's also an important issue for us.

197
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:54,387
I'll get going.

198
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,014
I have something really important today,
so I have to go.

199
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,161
Excuse me.

200
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,458
Me?

201
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,085
Cops visited your place last night, right?

202
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:29,171
That's right. And?

203
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,425
I was the one who reported you.

204
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:34,093
I see.

205
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,973
We made a ruckus, didn't we?

206
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:41,142
I'm sorry about that.
It won't happen again.

207
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:42,560
That's not it.

208
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:45,897
I don't think

209
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:48,650
you understood me.

210
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,401
All the noise you make...

211
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,863
can be heard in my unit.

212
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,205
What exactly did you hear?

213
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,749
Something breaking.

214
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:05,792
Something crashing.

215
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:06,710
Come on!

216
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,795
People exchanging blows and screaming.

217
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,505
You little...

218
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,841
In other words,

219
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:14,968
I heard people fighting to the death.

220
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:20,849
Did you hear a sob, too?

221
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,975
A friend of mine cried a river.

222
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:27,981
Of course.

223
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:30,108
Men shouldn't cry like that.

224
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,609
It's so off-putting.

225
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:35,322
No one cried.

226
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,323
What was that?

227
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:38,658
Sorry? It was nothing.

228
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:40,118
I get what you mean.

229
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:41,702
I'll be more careful going forward.

230
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,877
Who does he think he's talking to?

231
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:06,622
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE

232
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,195
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

233
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:00,415
APPLICATION FOR APPEAL

234
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,786
Where do I submit this form?

235
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,959
What is it?

236
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,586
An appeal form
against disciplinary action.

237
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,757
The seal is missing here.

238
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,509
It needs to be stamped.

239
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,053
I need approval from one of the professors

240
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,306
to dispute the decision they made?

241
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,807
Yes.

242
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,434
Why is that?

243
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,604
That's just how the rules are.

244
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:36,151
Technically speaking,
it wasn't their decision.

245
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,777
It was the school's.

246
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,362
But the professors...

247
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:43,450
It's the professors who make up

248
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,868
the school's disciplinary committee.

249
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:49,956
You still need their seal of approval.

250
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:03,678
You may be tested on
the structure of the skin,

251
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:06,264
so remember to revise that.
That will be all.

252
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:07,474
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

253
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:09,308
Good job today.

254
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:22,405
What do you want?

255
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,300
I need your seal.

256
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,050
APPLICATION OF APPEAL

257
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,621
I don't have my seal right now.
Come back later.

258
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:31,915
When? I need it now.

259
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,458
Come back later.

260
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,793
I'm in a rush, sir.

261
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:36,252
Please stamp it now.

262
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:37,961
I don't have my seal with me.

263
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:40,340
Set up an appointment first,
and I'll stamp it for you.

264
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,676
I don't have time for that
when I'm about to be expelled.

265
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,100
APPLICATION OF APPEAL

266
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:57,690
Take it.

267
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,327
What is it? Do you need something else?

268
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:13,081
-Professor Cho.
-Yes?

269
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,500
You know that
I wasn't in on it alone, right?

270
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,381
I mean,

271
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:24,383
I'll admit
that I organized the cheating ring,

272
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,262
but it was a group effort.

273
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:29,638
Other students organized it
for other subjects.

274
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:33,852
Why am I the only one getting expelled?

275
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:35,645
Why am I being expelled

276
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:38,731
when other students
only got held back or suspended?

277
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,447
You were the only one who got caught.

278
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,784
The others didn't.

279
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:55,081
But I submitted the messages
and emails as evidence.

280
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,292
Jae-hyo.

281
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:00,253
This is a school.
We're not an investigative body.

282
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:03,173
You cheated on an online exam

283
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:04,840
and were caught
by the professor in charge.

284
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,636
You even admitted it on the spot.

285
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:09,470
Those are the facts.

286
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:13,808
We don't know anything
about the evidence you gave us.

287
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,602
Even if such events occurred,

288
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,229
no one was caught.

289
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:22,233
Jae-hyo.

290
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:26,696
How many times do I have to tell you?

291
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,366
File a lawsuit if you feel so wronged.

292
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:30,825
Don't bother making appeals

293
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,661
and dragging the department's name
through the mud.

294
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,955
Let's go.

295
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,000
How much do you need?

296
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,003
What?

297
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,257
Moon Sang-hwi,

298
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:47,467
Park Hyun-woo,

299
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,260
and Jung Hyun-jin.

300
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,056
Their parents paid you and the school off.

301
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:54,807
I know that, too.

302
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,896
You insolent punk...

303
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,902
Would 500 million be enough?

304
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:09,218
PROFESSOR CHO JAE-HWANG

305
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,348
DAD

306
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:28,089
What is it?

307
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:30,937
SILBI RESTAURANT

308
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:39,727
Dad.

309
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,064
-Hey, Jun-seong.
-Hi.

310
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:45,859
-Goodness. Is that you, Jun-seong?
-Hello.

311
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:46,985
It's been a while.

312
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,778
Have you been well?

313
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:51,239
-You're a man now.
-Come on.

314
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:55,744
You're hard to get a hold of.

315
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,328
I know.

316
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,332
What's the rush, anyhow?

317
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:01,958
Well,

318
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:06,546
they're looking for catering
at a construction site nearby.

319
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,548
I'll be back soon. It won't take long.

320
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:11,217
Okay. I can't stay for long, though.

321
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:12,469
I told you.

322
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,262
I'll be busy for a while.

323
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:16,181
Doing what? Did you get a job?

324
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,307
No.

325
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:20,769
I'm just helping someone out.

326
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,812
Who are you helping?

327
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,983
Did you get a girlfriend?

328
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:28,902
How would I get a girlfriend?

329
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,820
I don't have one.

330
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,113
All right.

331
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:34,532
I get it can be frustrating,
but hang in there.

332
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:37,410
If this catering job goes well,

333
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,537
I'll open up another restaurant for you.

334
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:41,998
All right? I'll get going.

335
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:43,958
See you.

336
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,127
See you.

337
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:52,509
Jun-seong.

338
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,425
Yes?

339
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:57,211
Take your dad to see a doctor
when you're free.

340
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:59,421
He has frequent stomachaches.

341
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:08,608
His name is Park Min-woo.

342
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:12,278
The last call made from his phone
was traced to Sillim-dong.

343
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:15,699
And the little punk

344
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,660
used his credit card
in Hyoseong-dong yesterday afternoon.

345
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,162
It was for a company-owned taxi.

346
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:24,040
The license plate is "23B 4572."

347
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,418
There aren't
any more transactions after that.

348
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,387
I'm looking for 4572. That's 5545.

349
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:39,304
Four-five-seven-two.

350
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,641
Twenty-three B...

351
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,226
Twenty-three B...

352
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,102
Twenty-three B, four--

353
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,564
That's 4572.

354
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:50,817
I've found it.

355
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:57,824
Hello, sir.

356
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,077
Do you drive this taxi?

357
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,373
-Why do you ask?
-I just have a few questions.

358
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:08,543
Yesterday afternoon--
Gosh, that startled me.

359
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,295
Sir!

360
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:11,963
Sir!

361
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,538
Give me a moment.

362
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:47,957
I'll pay you back by next week.

363
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,418
I'm not a debt collector.

364
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,295
Relax.

365
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,713
What's this about?

366
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:55,882
Around 6 p.m. yesterday,

367
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:58,426
did you pick up a man
in his early twenties?

368
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,011
A man?

369
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,932
Don't you remember him?

370
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:10,897
I'm not sure.

371
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:16,945
If you tell me the truth,

372
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,362
I'll reward you.

373
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:22,117
How much?

374
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,243
The entire amount you owe today.

375
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:30,375
It was around 5:40 p.m.

376
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,461
I picked him up at the Dorim intersection.

377
00:24:33,461 --> 00:24:35,297
-Hello.
-Hello.

378
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:37,424
Hyoseong-dong rodeo, please.

379
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:41,093
Didn't he call or contact anyone?

380
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:44,014
He didn't call anyone,

381
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:45,682
but he seemed to be texting.

382
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:46,975
One more thing.

383
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:49,393
He said he was running late
and asked me to hurry.

384
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,605
That's all I remember.

385
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:55,399
I don't have anything else. I swear.

386
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,330
Why did he run anyway all of a sudden?

387
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,836
We can't get his text messages, right?

388
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:17,047
Do you mean his mobile messenger records?

389
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,256
Yes.

390
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:20,592
We'd need his phone to do that.

391
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,385
Or a warrant.

392
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:27,057
How about we do this instead?

393
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,309
Why don't we go looking for him

394
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:32,103
from the point where his phone died?

395
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:34,522
-Where?
-Sillim-dong, obviously.

396
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:37,359
That's where college students live.

397
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,819
A lot of students rent places there.

398
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:50,246
Excuse me, sir.
Could you speed it up a bit?

399
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:53,833
-Sure.
-Thank you.

400
00:25:56,544 --> 00:25:59,005
He must've been meeting someone he knew.

401
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:02,300

-Tell your parents, too.
-Why am I getting suspended?

Here you go.

423
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,503
Isn't today your day off after night duty?

424
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:27,839
That's right. It's my day off,

425
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,636
but some heroic officer
fired a Taser out of the blue.

426
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:34,846
Someone fired a Taser
in this part of town?

427
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:36,181
Who was it? And where?

428
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:39,559
Where else but the college town
in your neighborhood?

429
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,020
We were dispatched
because of a noise complaint,

430
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,814
but these two guys went ballistic.

431
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:48,234
Officer Kang and I
had to bring them here in cuffs.

432
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:51,446
I applied here hoping it would be quiet
since it's near a college,

433
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,573
but not a single day goes by in peace.

434

Wasn't there another man with them?

435
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:57,786
-What?
-I mean,

436
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:00,288
you said you brought in two men in cuffs.

437
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:02,331
Weren't there three men there?

438
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:04,084
There weren't.

439
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:05,585

458
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:38,321
I didn't share this with anyone.

Excuse me.

463
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,083
What about Min-woo?

464
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,168
Is he doing well? Is he okay?

465
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:21,364
Yes. He's doing fine.

466
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:23,533
Let's talk about his ransom.

<i>Try to buy some time

<i>Buy as much time as you can.</i>

Tomorrow's too soon.

472
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:44,512
I'd need at least three days.

473
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:47,765
I'll do my best
to get it ready in two days.

474
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:02,280
Get it done by tomorrow.

Otherwise,
