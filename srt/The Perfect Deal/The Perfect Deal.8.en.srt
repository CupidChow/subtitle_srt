00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,300
Hey, Lee Jun-seong.

2
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,266
Hey!

3
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,933
Fucking answer me!

4
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:12,933
Answer me!

5
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,499
Lee Jun-seong, are you okay?

6
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,033
Come to your senses?

7
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,466
Come on, pull yourself together!

8
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,372
It's okay.

9
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:57,116
We're going to be okay.

10
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,943
That prick brought it on himself.

11
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,309
We're going to be fine, okay?

12
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,399
You didn't kill him.

13
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,566
Fuck, I'm sorry!

14
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,333
I'm thirsty.

15
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,799
I'm thirsty.

16
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,033
Jae-hyo,

17
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,766
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:54,233
I think I ruined everything.

19
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,836
YOO SEUNG-HO

00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,875

LEE JOO-YOUNG

23
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:04,208
THE DEAL

24
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:08,499
In the past, I got in big trouble
with Su-an once.

25
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,366
-Why?
-For secretly going to an internet cafe.

26
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,682
I wondered how she found out where I was.

27
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:22,477
And it was by using this.

28
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,644
PHONE TRACKER

29
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,249
This is Su-an's location?

30
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:29,782
Yes, the last location before
her phone went dead.

31
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:31,316
Achasan.

32
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,149
What's that?

33
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,182
Song Jae-hyo's last phone location.

34
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:40,782
Where does it say he was?

35
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,749
18-40 Achasan-ro, Guri, Gyeonggi Province.

36
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,682
Achasan? That's where Su-an was.

37
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,749
So they were in the same place.

38
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,549
Those bastards...

39
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:56,282
Anything else?

40
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:05,016
Sorry for asking to meet
on such short notice.

41
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,582
It's okay, sir.

42
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:10,411
I'll keep it brief.

43
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,216
Why did you do that?

44
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,916
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,382
Why did you stop the men I sent?

46
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:24,316
Answer me.

47
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:27,940
I thought...

48
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,431
it wasn't time yet.

49
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:35,816
We need her if we're to find the kids.

50
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:39,716
Our utmost priority right now
is finding the money, isn't it?

51
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,333
I took in a parentless piece of shit,

52
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,899
fed him, and put a roof
over his head for 20 years.

53
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,266
During all those years,
you never went against me.

54
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,733
Why now?

55
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:03,166
Did seeing a mother's love for her child
move your heart?

56
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,633
Mr. Cho.

57
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,966
I'll take care of her myself.

58
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,566
I'll make it as painful as possible.

59
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,366
Jun-seong,

60
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:41,566
once Min-woo is found,
it will be a whole different ball game.

61
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,266
We need to think about what to do.

62
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,033
Can I...

63
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,323
use your phone?

64
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,816
You have a phone, don't you?

65
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:03,716
The burner phone you used
to call Min-woo's mom.

66
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,316
Didn't you use it to call your professor?

67
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:09,962
Professor,

68
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,682
did you see the photo?

69
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,349
I can get 500 million won.

70
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:28,561
I didn't mean to keep it from you.
I just kept it for an emergency.

71
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,671
I don't care.

72
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:32,643
I just need to make a call.

73
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:35,482
To who?

74
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:36,978
My dad...

75
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,121
and the moneylenders.

76
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,044
Jae-hyo.

77
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,382
Want to flee the country?

78
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,916
What?

79
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:58,317
After I pay off my debt

80
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,739
and give some money to my dad,

81
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,644
let's leave the country.

82
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:09,366
No matter how hard I think about it,
there's no other way.

83
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,266
Things just keep going downhill.

84
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,966
Before we're really fucked,

85
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,666
let's leave.

86
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:38,933
Only if I plan everything
and decide where we go.

87
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,566
No objections?

88
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,933
Cut the crap and just tell me
where I should go.

89
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:04,233
So you actually have the money, huh?

90
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:07,266
I'll text you the location. Come by 12.

91
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,533
Okay.

92
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,066
Dad.

93
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,799
Jun-seong?

94
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,161
How are you feeling?

95
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,133
Are you okay?

96
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,299
Where have you been all this time?

97
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:56,633
Dad, I won't be able to go home
for a while.

98
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,366
Why, what's wrong?

99
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:10,499
Just take good care of yourself, okay?
Don't be sick.

100
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,066
Dad.

101
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,733
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

102
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,966
I'm going to leave something
in a locker at Daerim Station.

103
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,466
Tell Mi-ae to go get it later.

104
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,266
What are you talking about?

105
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:40,127
Don't ask about the reason.
Once I wrap things up,

106
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,699
I'll call you again.

107
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,133
<i>Jun-seong.</i>

108
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,466
<i>Jun-seong. Hello? Jun-seong.</i>

109
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,989
I love you, Dad.

110
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,466
Damn it.

111
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,246
Detective,

112
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:17,966
I apologize on behalf of my son,

113
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,685
so please go easy on him.

114
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:24,046
You don't have to worry.

115
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,799
We will find your son

116
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,833
and bring him back safely.

117
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,266
Yes.

118
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,466
MS. KIM URGENT

119
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,019
LEE JUN-SEONG HEADED
TO DAERIM STATION LOCKER

120
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm going myself.

121
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:24,082
Mr. Cho had some business to attend to.
We will take you home.

122
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,156
Min-woo.

123
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,766
I will tell you everything...

124
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,533
about what happened.

125
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,090
As I said on the phone, we found it
on patrol duty this morning.

126
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,281
The residents say it's been here
for two days.

127
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,303
-Right?
-Yes.

128
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:39,182
Since early yesterday morning
to be exact.

129
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,166
What's that?

130
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,499
Can we just barge in like this?

131
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,066
The people there all hunt illegally.

132
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:18,099
I think she was probably shot while
wandering around the area.

133
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,533
Who are you?

134
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,833
The police.

135
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,833
Lieutenant Cha Jae-gyeong
of Gwanak Station.

136
00:14:57,366 --> 00:15:01,033
This is everything. There's not much here.

137
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,233
Does that work?

138
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,942
Oh, that?

139
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:16,166
It's just a fake.

140
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,266
It's empty inside.

141
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,899
Why's that?

142
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,799
What do you think?
We're short on money obviously.

143
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,333
Do you want to look around some more?

144
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,766
Suit yourself.

145
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:38,933
I'll be in touch.

146
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,633
Sure.

147
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,333
Jae-gyeong, let's call it a day.

148
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,133
There's nothing here.

149
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,766
Huh?

150
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,666
What is it?

151
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,999
Is it Su-an's?

152
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,533
Jae-gyeong...

153
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,766
Three hours is enough, right?

154
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,433
Yeah.

155
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:55,066
Then I'll meet with the money changer
and figure out how to leave the country.

156
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:59,166
I don't think deciding on
the destination will be an issue,

157
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,582
but since it's such a
large sum of money,

158
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,758
I think it will take
time to exchange.

159
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,999
Okay.

160
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:11,966
I'm off.

161
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,366
Hey, Jun-seong.

162
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,233
Nevermind.

163
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,933
See you later.

164
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,916
Let's go.

165
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,206
Yes.

166
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:48,384
Only if I plan everything
and decide where we go.

167
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,917
No objections?

168
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:55,233
I just need to make a call.

169
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,299
To who?

170
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,233
My dad and the moneylenders.

171
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:09,753
OUTGOING CALLS

172
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,299
Yes, of course.

173
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,933
I understand what you mean.

174
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:28,999
Can you call back in three minutes?

175
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,733
Okay.

176
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,144
Is it the full amount?

177
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,828
Yes, sir.

178
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,733
To be honest,

179
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:48,333
I never thought you'd pay this all back.

180
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:52,948
You know how to keep up
your end of the bargain, huh, kiddo?

181
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:55,034
We're done, right?

182
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,206
I'm off.

183
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,966
Hold on, hold on.

184
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:03,999
What's the hurry? I'm a little upset.

185
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,733
We've grown on each other.

186
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,233
Hey!

187
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,533
Long time no see.

188
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,466
Jun-seong.

189
00:21:24,022 --> 00:21:25,695
Fuck.

190
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,933
I just got a request from someone.

191
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:31,945
They're willing to add 200 million
to the 400 million you paid.

192
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,281
In exchange,

193
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,799
they want us to sell your organs

194
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,633
and toss your body into the ocean.

195
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,199
And...

196
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,766
do you know who that person is?

197
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,556
Your friend.

198
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,425
Song Jae-hyo.

199
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,466
Ha...

200
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,833
He also asked this.

201
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,133
Once everything is ready,

202
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:07,399
he asked to talk to you one last time.

203
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,799
Here.

204
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,666
Hello?

205
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,699
<i>Jun-seong.</i>

206
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,266
Yeah.

207
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,833
<i>You heard everything, right?</i>

208
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,457
Yeah,

209
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,599
I did.

210
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,599
Talk.

211
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,199
I can't leave.

212
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,333
You know that.

213
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,933
Okay.

214
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,399
<i>I've thought long and hard about this.</i>

215
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,299
But there's no other way.

216
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:09,926
There's no other way...

217
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,171
to turn my life around.

218
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:15,999
You know what I'm saying?

219
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,499
Yeah, I do.

220
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,766
Yeah.

221
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,633
I'm sorry.

222
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,466
No, don't be.

223
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,266
I'm sorry too.

224
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,433
But Jae-hyo,

225
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:48,099
it's not all going to work out
the way you want.

226
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:56,199
Jae-hyo... I really wanted

227
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:01,500
to save both you and Min-woo,

228
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,389
but...

229
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,728
I think I was in over my head.

230
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,533
You'll find out soon. Sorry, bye.

231
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:32,133
-Let's go.
-Fucking let go.

232
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,999
Let's go.

233
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:36,033
Fuck, don't touch me!

234
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,599
Fucking asshole! You asshole!

235
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,166
Fucking die, you shithead!

236
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:55,033
Don't!

237
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,133
You fucking son of a bitch!

238
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,466
Fucking let go!

239
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:05,499
Asshole!

240
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,899
Let go, you fucker!

241
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:08,799
-Come here, you fucking bastard!
-You fucker.

242
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,899
Argh, don't!

243
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:14,866
You fucking bastards!

244
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,733
-You fucker.
-Fucking bastards.

245
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:19,099
Stay still.

246
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:20,599
Tie him up!

247
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,999
Hold his legs!

248
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:29,366
-Stay still.
-Hold him down.

249
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:32,399
Jun-seong.

250
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,033
I'm very sorry about last time,

251
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,151
so I'll give you an extra dose today.

252
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:39,776
No...

253
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,647
Don't.

254
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:54,999
What the hell?

255
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:05,449
Who are you?

256
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,216
Where is Lee Jun-seong?

257
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:09,716
What the fuck.

258
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:12,082
Son of a bitch.

259
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,916
You motherfucker!

260
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,632
Who the fuck are you?

261
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,399
Where's Lee Jun-seong?

262
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,833
What?

263
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,133
Forget it.

264
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,966
What the fuck, you son of a bitch.

265
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,133
Fuck.

266
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,233
You bastard.

267
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,099
Get out.

268
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,733
Where's your friend?

269
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:10,299
Lee Jun-seong!

270
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,566
Where's Park Min-woo?

271
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:18,028
Ask him yourself.

272
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:20,033
He's alive...

273
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,866
Clean up the mess here.

274
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:40,499
What about Song Jae-hyo?

275
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:48,033
Did you hunt him down, you punk?

276
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:51,099
Yes.

277
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,166
You crazy shithead.

278
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:19,699
Director Hwang isn't the only one
who can play dirty.

279
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,566
Find her son and kill him.

280
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,835
Kill the deranged mother too.

281
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:25,480
Kill them all.

282
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:36,866
Ma'am.

283
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:41,764
Why are you looking at me like that?

284
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,766
You're the one who planned
to kill me first.

285
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,899
Doing away with me won't
put an end to this.

286
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:58,433
That's only if
Director Hwang is still alive.

287
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,799
I'll take charge of the syndicate
and turn it into a department store.

288
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:24,433
Go back to the baseball stadium.

289
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:27,799
Thank you for everything.

290
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:35,001
MS. KIM

291
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:36,933
What is it?

292
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:40,633
We finished the job.

293
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,233
What should we do with
Lee Jun-seong and Song Jae-hyo?

294
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,866
You should ask Min-woo about that.

295
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,408
MS. KIM

296
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:22,199
Hello, Ms. Kim.

297
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,733
You woke up?

298
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,433
It's been a while.

299
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,502
How...

300
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:58,399
How long have I been here?

301
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,066
Three or four days.

302
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,766
You had an overdose of anesthesia.

303
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:09,599
It wasn't easy saving your life.

304
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:14,266
Why?

305
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:17,133
What do you mean why?

306
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,133
Why did you save me?

307
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,333
Because you saved my life.

308
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,934
You're one hell of an actor.

309
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:32,677
Pretending to choke me.

310
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,011
I didn't know what was going on.

311
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:42,399
Min-woo... please die.

312
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,233
Please, just die.

313
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:50,839
<i>What is this?</i>

314
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,519
<i>What's he trying to do?</i>

315
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:56,504
Then...

316
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,899
I realized it.

317
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,399
Ah.

318
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:05,733
He's planning to ditch Song Jae-hyo.

319
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,266
In order to save me.

320
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:15,854
How was my reaction?

321
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:17,608
Was it okay?

322
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,572
Jae-hyo...

323
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,966
Where is he?

324
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:27,466
You want to know?

325
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,499
Deep down,

326
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,066
I wanted to kill both of you
with my own hands.

327
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:44,033
But I couldn't do that to you.

328
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:49,477
You kept saying you were sorry.

329
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:54,932
And...

330
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:57,738
you carried me on your back in gym class.

331
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:08,933
You're the only person
who did that for me.

332
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:15,766
I'm sorry... really.

333
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,133
No need to apologize.

334
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,466
We've gone too far for that.

335
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:26,899
Yeah.

336
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:41,070
Let's not cross paths ever again.

337
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:45,666
Yeah.

338
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,933
Take care.

339
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,333
Oh.

340
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:14,666
The stuff you stored in the subway locker.
It's still there.

341
