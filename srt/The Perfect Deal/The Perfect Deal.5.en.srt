8
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:39,744
Hey.

9
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,277
Can we talk?

10
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,711
I went to that house yesterday.

11
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:56,111
I'm Detective Cha Jae-gyeong
from Gwanak Police Station.

12
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:59,044
Local police officers came by
the other day.

13
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,011
This is a follow-up investigation.

14
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,511
Follow up?

15
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:05,144
It's all part of the normal protocol.

16
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,511
Can I take a look around the house?

17
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,677
Excuse me.

18
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,311
Wow.

19
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,311
You've got a big place here.

20
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:22,277
It's just the two of you?

21
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:25,077
No one else?

22
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:27,211
No.

23
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:42,677
I went inside the house
with Cheol's mom's master key.

24
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:54,211
The problem with old houses

25
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:58,211
is that there's no heat
in the bathroom, right?

26
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,277
What?

27
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:01,177
It's chilly in here.

28
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:03,377
Ah, yeah.

29
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,177
Where is your room?

30
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,244
Ah...

31
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,177
There.

32
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:15,611
Ah.

33
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:33,491
They have a kid locked up in the closet.

34
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,744
Can you leave if you're done?

35
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,144
Yes, sorry for bothering you this late.

36
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:23,877
Thank you for your cooperation.

37
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,977
Just a moment.

38
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:05,577
I think you need to call someone.

39
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,011
Sorry?

40
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,644
It's not level, don't you see?

41
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:17,811
Ah, yeah, you're right.

42
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:24,944
There was absolutely nothing.

43
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:28,277
I even checked the bathroom.

44
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,211
No, that can't be.

45
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:34,744
Why would I lie to you?

46
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,177
Ah.

47
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,211
Here.

48
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,311
Are you sure you saw it?

49
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:48,344
I didn't see, I only heard.

50
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,677
What do you mean? Heard what?

51
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:54,244
I heard them fighting and making threats.

52
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,777
You only heard it?

53
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,677
So this was just a wild goose chase then.

54
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:05,811
What did you say? Wild what?

55
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:09,911
You must've been hearing things
since you're desperate.

56
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:11,311
Come again?

57
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:15,177
What I mean to say is--

58
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:19,477
What do you mean I'm desperate?
Give it to me straight.

59
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,377
Well, you're interview is coming up
and you needed something.

60
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,144
You did that out of desperation.
Am I wrong?

61
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:32,711
So you're saying I made this all up
just for the interview?

62
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,277
Ah...

63
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:38,644
I'm not saying you did it on purpose,

64
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:42,577
but maybe it's because
you're so distressed these days.

65
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,377
What the heck are you saying?

66
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,744
Just get lost.

67
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:50,044
I've had enough!

68
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:52,044
You're been so edgy while preparing

69
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:55,744
for the police exams, I can't say anything
without you getting all riled up.

70
00:07:55,744 --> 00:08:00,077
Hey, what's the big deal
that I became a cop first?

71
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:04,377
The way you've been treating me,
that's your inferiority complex, you know.

72
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,611
You didn't come to make peace.

73
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:13,177
You came to tell me that I was wrong.

74
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:16,877
Don't ever come to see me again.
Until I die.

75
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,244
Hey...

76
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:32,177
We haven't heard from the abductors yet.

77
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:35,677
Park Min-woo's phone signal
was last picked up

78
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,477
by that over there.

79
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,244
It has a four-kilometer radius,
maybe five.

80
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:44,844
That means it pretty much covers
the entire neighborhood.

81
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,877
So how many people are we talking about?

82
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:50,711
Well, just his classmates alone total 30.

83
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:53,811
If we include his alumni too,
it would be in the hundreds.

84
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:57,711
So basically, three days is not enough.

85
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:01,277
You called me out here
to say you can't do it?

86
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:04,444
No, of course not.

87
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,977
I came up with a brilliant idea.

88
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:08,844
What is it?

89
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:11,077
Well, it's...

90
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,944
Hypnosis.

91
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:20,677
Of who?

92
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,811
The lady, of course.
Since she heard it firsthand.

93
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:29,144
Reunion.

94
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:32,644
He went to a high school reunion
a few times.

95
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:08,377
I saw a police station on the way here.

96
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,477
Will it be okay?

97
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:15,777
It's exactly a 15-minute drive.
Nothing to worry about.

98
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:19,311
Taking ten billion won in 15 minutes.

99
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,931
Is it possible?

100
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:28,453
Sure, it's possible. It has to be.

101
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,119
As long as we don't get caught.

102
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:35,686
Besides, it's safer than getting the money
from Min-woo's mom.

103
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:39,119
What about the safe?
How are we going to open it?

104
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,553
Min-woo will.

105
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,519
You want to bring Park Min-woo here?

106
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:47,419
Or we could get the combination from him
and open it ourselves.

107
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,653
But our problem right now is Park Min-woo.

108
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:00,486
He's so pissed off at us that
he didn't even eat breakfast.

109
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,986
Why that fucking bastard.

110
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:10,619
Honestly, haven't we done all
we can for him?

111
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,886
We even had a detective
breathing down our necks.

112
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:17,086
Still, I think we were
a little harsh on him.

113
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:20,153
We even put a blanket over him.
What more does he want?

114
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
MOON SEONGSIK HYPNOSIS LAB

115
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,319
I will wait outside.

116
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,953
Stay.

117
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:39,019
What if something happens?

118
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:45,353
They told me that your son
has been kidnapped.

119
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,619
Yes.

120
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:54,019
Frankly speaking, I'm not sure
if this is going to work.

121
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:58,719
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

122
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,486
Thank you.

123
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:05,953
But...

124
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,153
do you know how I feel?

125
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:14,286
I want to cut off all ten of my fingers.

126
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:18,286
And that means,

127
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:19,653
if it could help me find my son,

128
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:24,286
I could do the same to someone else.

129
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,786
I have the power to do that too.

130
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,219
So, no need to feel pressured.

131
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,686
You can relax. Relax,

132
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:40,886
and just do the best you can.

133
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:44,219
Okay.

134
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:48,853
Then, shall we start right away?
Okay.

135
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:55,386
I want you to focus on my hand.

136
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,986
Just relax

137
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,686
and look at my hand.

138
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:04,786
Okay, very slowly...

139
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,486
If you're ready, I'm going to apply
a little pressure.

140
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,653
You are going

141
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:17,819
to go on a journey.

142
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:33,019
As for the combination,

143
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,086
I'll tell you if you take me there.

144
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,653
I mean, how am I supposed to trust you?

145
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,486
Min-woo.

146
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,353
We're doing this

147
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:46,319
so we don't have to kill you.

148
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,553
If we split the money in that safe,
that makes us accomplices.

149
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:52,053
I know. I'm the one who suggested it,
why wouldn't I know?

150
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:55,186
You know, but why are you saying
you want to come with us?

151
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:58,686
Be honest. You're up to something,
aren't you, you bastard?

152
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,119
I'm warning you. Watch what you say.

153
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,053
I'm not the bastard, you are, got it?

154
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,453
Did you just call me a bastard?

155
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,586
Why can't I?

156
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:09,253
You're the one who put me
in a washing machine.

157
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:11,219
Hey, get the fuck up.

158
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:14,619
Was ten minutes of spin drying not enough?
How about 20 minutes? That'll be fun.

159
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:15,953
Cut it out!

160
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:17,753
So get the fuck up!

161
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:19,186
That's enough!

162
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,053
Jun-seong.

163
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:39,419
You already verified that the safe
is stored there.

164
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,953
And there's money in there, of course.

165
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:46,653
If you take me there, I'll open it myself.

166
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:51,019
I swear, I'm not up to anything.
For real.

167
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:55,886
Just think about it.

168
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,586
To live, I have to be an accomplice.

169
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,653
So why would I do something stupid?

170
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:02,353
That psycho Song Jae-hyo
would kill me right away.

171
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,786
What? Hey! Hey!

172
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,386
Want me to kill you now, huh?

173
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,053
Damn it.

174
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,519
Hey.

175
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,919
I don't ever want to hear you
speak my name again.

176
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:24,353
And don't try to
gaslight Jun-seong, got it?

177
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:26,519
I have no reason to speak
your name anyway.

178
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:39,886
Jun-seong...

179
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,286
Do you have the money?

180
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:48,419
You'll need a lot of money
to carry out your plan.

181
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,319
No.

182
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,519
No, Min-woo.

183
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,719
Don't go there.

184
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,453
Please, don't go there.

185
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,119
Listen to your mom.

186
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,753
Listen to your mom, Min-woo, please!

187
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,086
-Stop this.
-No, no. We're almost there.

188
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:13,019
Okay, ma'am, calm down.

189
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,919
Relax and breathe out slowly.

190
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,486
Don't go! Don't go, Min-woo!

191
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:22,486
Don't go!

192
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:26,719
Okay. We're going to go
a little further back in time.

193
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,163
Go back a little further.

194
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:30,719
No, I can't!

195
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,919
My son, my son just went out to meet them.

196
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,119
-I have to bring my son back.
-Hold on.

197
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,219
Who are the people Min-woo went to meet?

198
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,319
They... they are...

199
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,019
Who are they?

200
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,353
Im...

201
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:52,686
Geez, Im Tae-yeong's coming?

202
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,119
Where's Tae-yeong?

203
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:58,586
He couldn't make it.

204
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,853
Im Tae-yeong.

205
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,653
What? You want money from us?

206
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:13,619
We already apologized. Isn't that enough?

207
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,086
It's not like we ratted you out.
What more do you want?

208
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:24,086
What's going on?

209
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:28,886
Woah.

210
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:25,114
Want to settle for two million per person,

211
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:28,486
or want to end your life right here?
Choose.

212
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:31,324
POLICE OPEN RECRUITMENT
INTERVIEW EXAM CENTER

213
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:39,119
Number 278, please come in.

214
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,519
Yes.

215
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:50,086
All right. On to the next question then.

216
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,886
It says here that you volunteered
in the neighborhood watch program.

217
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,386
How long did you do it?

218
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:57,953
Around two years.

219
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:01,653
Wow, that's quite a long time.
How was it?

220
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,119
It was great.

221
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,986
I was happy to assist the police officers
at the community policing center.

222
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:10,919
Most of all, during those two years,

223
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,619
the crime rate in our neighborhood
went down by 5%.

224
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:17,653
This is the final question.

225
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,319
If you are in a situation
where both your safety

226
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,886
and the victim's safety are at risk,

227
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:26,153
what would you do?

228
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:27,653
Uh...

229
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:33,286
In that situation, I would immediately...

230
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:42,241
Applicant?

231
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,419
Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:51,053
I would immediately...

233
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:22,941
You didn't answer the question?

234
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:26,344
My mind suddenly went blank
and I couldn't say a word.

235
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:30,077
Why? It's a straightforward question.
Didn't you prepare a model answer?

236
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:32,444
Of course I did.

237
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:36,111
I did, but I don't know
what happened to me.

238
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,944
You'll be fine. You aced everything else.

239
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:41,544
-Just forget about it.
-Yeah.

240
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:44,944
I'm going to take it easy today.
You have a good day too.

241
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,844
Yeah, training is about to begin.

242
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:49,677
Okay. Stay safe and don't get hurt again.
See you tomorrow.

243
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:51,277
Okay. Love you!

244
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:52,711
Bye.

245
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,944
When did you start hanging out
with Song Jae-hyo?

246
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,644
Why do you ask?

247
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,211
Because you're not like him.

248
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,711
How so?

249
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:01,877
I mean,

250
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,544
Song Jae-hyo is a real psychopath.

251
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:08,377
That prick went berserk
and decided to kidnap me.

252
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,477
He told me you were
against this all along.

253
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:20,011
So, what is it you want from me?

254
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:25,077
What do you want from driving a wedge
between Jae-hyo and me?

255
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:29,311
Ha.

256
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,844
No, it's not that. Why would I do that?

257
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:37,277
Untie my feet at least.
I have to get in the car, don't I?

258
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:46,844
Jun-seong.

259
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,411
Put your feet down.

260
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:55,144
Only untie him once we get the money.

261
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,677
Then do you expect me to hop to the car?

262
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:04,911
You're not going in the car.
You're going in here.

263
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,944
Are you telling me to get in the suitcase?

264
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:10,277
Yeah. Ah, we have to gag you first.

265
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:13,044
I'm a human being, not luggage.

266
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:14,611
Why don't you shut that mouth?

267
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:16,977
You even went in the washing machine.

268
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,911
It's only for a little while.

269
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,311
I told you he's a psycho.

270
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,011
Let's do this then.

271
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,044
We untie his feet.

272
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:27,411
But you have to go in the suitcase.

273
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:29,111
-Don't want to.
-Me neither.

274
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:29,911
Geez.

275
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:32,777
You don't have a choice. You're a hostage.

276
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,311
Psychopath.

277
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,911
-You crazy bastard.
-Jae-hyo!

278
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:38,811
What? Why?

279
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,144
-Let go!
-Come on.

280
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:41,277
What's wrong with you?

281
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:44,511
I said let go! Aren't you tired
of playing the nice guy?

282
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:46,377
Until when do I have to do
everything your way?

283
00:23:46,377 --> 00:23:48,677
I've done everything you wanted.

284
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,944
I agreed to take him with us.

285
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:53,044
I even put clothes on him as you wanted.

286
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:55,577
Then shouldn't you fucking
listen to me for once?

287
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:58,811
Okay. But don't treat Min-woo like that.
Come here. Let's talk.

288
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,811
Let go!

289
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:04,244
Am I wrong? Answer me.

290
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:09,844
I'll do it. I'll go in there.

291
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:12,444
It's not a big deal anyway.

292
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,377
Come on. Load the luggage.

293
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:01,777
Excuse me. You're Mr. Im Tae-yeong, right?

294
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:04,111
Who are you?

295
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:07,777
Ah, it's about separating the trash.

296
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,577
Shh!

297
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:23,277
Where is Park Min-woo? Park Min-woo.
Answer me.

298
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:29,211
I'm going to take my hand away.

299
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:33,677
But if you scream, I'm going to kill you.
Understand?

300
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:36,977
Okay... let go of my hand.

301
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,377
Where is Park Min-woo?

302
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:47,144
But who are you really?

303
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:51,344
Why are you doing this to me?

304
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:54,377
And how do you know my name?

305
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,744
Holy shit.

306
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,311
Answer the question.

307
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:11,677
Okay.

308
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:16,251
He's a classmate from high school.
But I haven't seen him.

309
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,420
A few of us planned to get together

310
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,644
for drinks a few days ago,
but we called it off.

311
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,311
Who are the others?

312
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:26,844
Song Jae-hyo and Lee Jun-seong.

313
00:26:26,844 --> 00:26:28,077
I never went there.

314
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:29,644
Where do those punks live now?

315
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:32,444
Those punks... uh...

316
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:35,077
I don't know about Lee Jun-seong,

317
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:36,734
but Song Jae-hyo...

318
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:41,444
Sillim-dong. That's where he lives.

319
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:44,409
Uh... Daeyang Villa. Yes, Daeyang Villa.

320
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:57,043
LOCATED SONG JAE-HYO
B101, DAEYANG VILLA, SILLIM-DONG

321
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:17,411
Hey, slow down.

322
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:22,044
Wait a sec.

323
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:23,677
Hold it up higher.

324
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,311
Geez.

325
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,611
One, two, three. Oof!

326
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,677
-I'm backing out.
-Yeah.

327
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:05,577
-Why isn't it moving?
-What are you doing?

328
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:06,911
It's not moving.

329
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:08,744
What are you saying?

330
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,277
Hey, get out of the way!

331
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:12,777
Okay.

332
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:15,544
Come. Back out straight.

333
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,877
A bit more. More, more, more.

334
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,544
No, stop!

335
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:21,877
Go forward then back.

336
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:23,277
Forward?

337
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:40,777
Hey, hey!

338
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:43,344
Center. That's it.
Back, back.

339
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:44,411
I think I'm going to hit the wall.

340
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:46,044
You won't! Come on.

341
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:52,044
Darn.

342
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:54,411
Hey, mister! Move!

343
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:59,177
Mister, back up!

344
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:00,744
Hey, come with me!

345
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,244
-Okay?
-Yeah, come.

346
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,911
More, more.

347
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,311
Okay, stop.

348
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:15,811
-Get in!
-Okay.

349
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,144
You didn't have to yell at me like that.

350
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:23,411
Why don't you drive properly then?

351
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,711
Hey, Park Min-woo!

352
00:30:36,844 --> 00:30:40,211
What time is it? Isn't it past ten?

353
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,077
Why isn't he going home?

354
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,711
He will soon.

355
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,277
Hey, he's coming out!

356
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,977
He came out.

357
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:50,777
Are you sure he's leaving?

358
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,511
Yeah, I'm sure.

359
00:30:57,544 --> 00:30:59,111
-Let's go.
-Hey.

360
00:30:59,111 --> 00:31:00,911
Let Min-woo out first.

361
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:14,211
Darn it. Where did they go?

362
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:30,244
Three?

363
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:34,277
What? He's alive.

364
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:40,144
If you are in a situation
where both your safety

365
00:31:40,144 --> 00:31:42,677
and the victim's safety are at risk,

366
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:45,344
what would you do?

367
00:31:49,077 --> 00:31:50,511
What the heck...

368
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:51,977
Argh!

369
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,718
Turn your head.

370
00:32:10,877 --> 00:32:12,233
Ready?

371
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,533
-Yeah.
-Wait a sec.

372
00:32:15,344 --> 00:32:16,977
Careful, careful.

373
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,277
-Come on.
-Hurry up and go.

374
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,077
What are you doing?

375
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,211
-I feel really nauseous.
-Cut the crap and get moving.

376
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,860
Careful, careful.

377
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,877
Yeah.

378
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:33,144
-Is this the right way?
-Yeah, it is.

379
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:46,877
Keep moving.

380
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,711
Darn, what the hell!

381
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:03,444
Keep quiet, will you?

382
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:04,911
Walk faster.

383
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:24,811
Found it. It's this one.

384
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:26,277
It is?

385
00:33:27,077 --> 00:33:28,444
Yep.

386
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:37,077
There are three locks.
I need the cutter.

387
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,544
Hey, Min-woo. I need the light.

388
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,077
Quick.

389
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:03,577
What are you doing? We need the light.

390
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:05,911
Stop moving your darn head.

391
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:14,877
Shit. Why won't it break?

392
00:34:14,877 --> 00:34:16,844
It won't break?

393
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:22,344
Where is our hammer?

394
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,644
I'm sure I put it in the bag.

395
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:27,077
Finally.

396
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:29,544
You stole it, didn't you?

397
00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:31,711
What are you saying?

398
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:34,644
How on earth could I steal it?

399
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,211
-Get over here.
-Why?

400
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,044
I said come here! Just do as I say.

401
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:44,544
Fuck, am I your lapdog?

402
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:46,777
Keep it down, both of you!

403
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,411
Hey, you hold this.

404
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,877
Hold it.

405
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:51,211
Hold onto it.

406
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:53,811
Hang on a sec.
I think we should cut it here.

407
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,744
One, two, three.

408
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:02,477
Hang on. One, two, three.

409
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:36,218
-Hey!
-What the...

410
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:51,367
If you make one more move,
I'm sending this to the police.

411
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:54,811
Unit 101! I know you're a med student.

412
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,277
Who is she?

413
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:00,244
Unit 102?

414
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,344
Stop talking. You, the tall one,
come over here quick.

415
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,144
You mean... me?

416
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,277
Yes, come on, quick!

417
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,711
-What? The hammer.
-Why that...

418
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,344
You bastards are dead meat.

419
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:17,044
Search all you want.
You think you'll find the money in there?

420
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,011
You fuckers.

421
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,677
What?

422
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,544
-Is your leg okay?
-Yes.

423
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:27,011
-Take this.
-What is it?

424
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:29,444
Go out the way you came
and you'll see a scooter.

425
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:32,777
You'll find a tool to untie your hands.
Head straight to the police.

426
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:34,277
Don't move!

427
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:36,777
I said don't move.

428
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:41,611
But aren't you coming with me?

429
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,277
Those punks have a van.

430
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:45,511
I'll watch them, so just hurry up and go.

431
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:47,977
Thank you.

432
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:51,262
You don't have to thank me.

433
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,824
Just go!

434
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:55,844
You have to stay safe.

435
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:06,344
-Huh?
-Huh?

436
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,177
Don't... don't move!

437
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:13,282
Wait... wait...

438
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:15,277
Are you guys trying to play me?

439
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,111
-Hey.
-Shit.

440
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:32,677
Nobody move.

441
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:58,618
THE SAFE
