1
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,509
Jian,

2
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,150
the license plate "Yan 88700" should also

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,280
be a fake for the Besturn.

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,400
The original car has been in the Yanping Airport parking lot

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,130
for three days without moving.

6
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,090
Switching plates twice in one operation,

7
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,810
are you that well prepared?

8
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,030
This guy who seems to be Luca,

9
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,240
why do I think

10
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,360
he looks so much like the one who sabotaged

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
Zhao Yaning's brakes and took your money

12
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,870
for photos before?

13
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
Could it be the same person?

14
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,840
But why did he follow you this time?

15
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,680
To assassinate you?

16
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,570
He's really crazy then.

17
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,450
What does he want to do?

18
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, right.

19
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,090
During the tracking process,

20
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
the guy fell

21
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,910
pretty hard.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,910
I guess he sprained his ankle.

23
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,680
He limped after getting up.

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
If Luca's also

25
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,590
also limping now,

26
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,910
then we can basically conclude

27
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,040
this person is Luca.

28
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,110
That simplifies things.

29
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
Just keep a close eye on Luca

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
and see what we can find out.

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,090
Understood.

32
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Division Director Yang.

33
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,270
Hello, you called?

34
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,630
Are you free tonight?

35
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,360
Why? What is it?

36
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,260
Let's talk about it in person.

37
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

38
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
Send me the location.

39
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,950
My package, please.

40
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,430
Wang.

41
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,800
Go get the package.

42
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,130
Okay.

43
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
Any problem with my passport?

44
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,390
No problem. Waiting a moment, please.

45
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay.

46
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,040
Please check your package.

47
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Okay.

48
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,770
Okay.

49
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,840
Please sign your name.

50
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,170
Okay.

51
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,610
Your passport.

52
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,110
Thank you.

53
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,660
See you.

54
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,170
Why did you suddenly ask me out?

55
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,800
What's up?

56
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,280
Can't I just want to see you?

57
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
Of course you can.

58
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,440
By the way,

59
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,670
that night,

60
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,440
at your boss's house,

61
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,240
I did drink a lot

62
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,750
and talk too much.

63
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,840
Did I embarrass you?

64
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,000
What they think

65
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,790
doesn't matter to me.

66
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,150
Besides,

67
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,280
who hasn't gotten drunk before?

68
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,870
I was so drunk that I slept at your house.

69
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,490
Are you embarrassed of me?

70
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,610
That's because that night

71
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
you were so tired.

72
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,360
No matter how tired I am,

73
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,930
I've never slept at someone else's house.

74
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Being with you

75
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,990
makes me feel at ease.

76
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,180
Although I've only known you for a short time

77
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
and I don't know much about you,

78
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,120
I enjoy being with you.

79
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,460
What about you?

80
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,030
Do you like to be with me?

81
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
You can refuse to answer,

82
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,480
but if you do,

83
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,240
I want to hear the truth.

84
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,250
I like it.

85
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,750
Thank you.

86
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,450
I'm very satisfied with this answer.

87
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,720
This is your reward.

88
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,600
Gosh.

89
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,000
If I got it wrong, it's gone?

90
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Yes.

91
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,000
Take a look.

92
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,920
Do you like it?

93
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,200
What is this?

94
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,550
Just tell me if you like it.

95
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,630
Yes, I... I like it.

96
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,170
But this...

97
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,030
is so not your style.

98
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
Let me show you.

99
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,670
This is you

100
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
in the Capital City.

101
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,790
This

102
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,390
is

103
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,000
you in China.

104
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,440
Am I that twisted in China?

105
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,790
Yes.

106
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,630
This one.

107
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,750
This is you on a mission.

108
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
And this

109
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,630
is the you in my eyes.

110
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,550
In your eyes?

111
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,790
What am I doing?

112
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,180
Doing exercise...

113
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,390
Making a heart.

114
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,240
Oh my god, you call this a heart?

115
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,960
Okay. Okay.

116
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,750
Is this how you play?

117
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,960
Okay, I got it.

118
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
This is you

119
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,840
who made a wish on your birthday.

120
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,910
This is you who cried pitifully

121
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,200
after the car accident that night.

122
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,670
Okay.

123
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,270
Okay.

124
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,790
Come on.

125
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,200
You sleeping at my house.

126
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,720
Okay.

127
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,480
This is

128
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,000
you in my eyes.

129
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,440
Why is it my back in your eyes?

130
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,150
Because every time you turn around,

131
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,960
it catches me

132
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,510
off guard.

133
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,120
Okay.

134
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
So tell me,

135
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,910
what am I like in your eyes?

136
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,470
I've actually thought about it.

137
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,790
If you hadn't gone abroad,

138
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,660
what would you be like now?

139
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,450
What would I be like?

140
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,030
Probably the same,

141
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,840
maybe in a different job,

142
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,600
in a different city,

143
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,840
but the core

144
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,400
would never change.

145
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,720
Let me tell you

146
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
what I might have done

147
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,290
if I hadn't gone abroad.

148
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
I would probably be a teacher

149
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
at school.

150
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,480
That's good.

151
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,080
Working from 9AM to 5PM,

152
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,030
owning a house,

153
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,910
with the sea

154
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,750
and blooming flowers in view,

155
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,390
Nice.

156
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
I would have a funny lover

157
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,790
a lovely child,

158
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,080
and

159
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,480
a dog that likes to lie on my knees.

160
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,440
You believed it.

161
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,000
You believed it?

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,260
What's wrong with you?

163
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,200
It would be so boring.

164
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,080
Let me tell you,

165
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,030
people in our industry are as sick as you.

166
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,000
A peaceful life has nothing to do with us.

167
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,670
You actually believe that?

168
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,030
You fooled me, did you?

169
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,840
Fine.

170
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Okay.

171
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,770
Here's to two patients.

172
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,120
Here's to

173
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,910
two patients

174
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,570
who won't go alone.

175
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,550
Unlocked.

176
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,360
Boss,

177
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,270
I've got the first package.

178
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,360
The next one will be sent directly to Leader

179
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
International Express.

180
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,390
Addressed to Jack.

181
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,030
Got it, Boss.

182
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,839
We've been watching Luca for days.

183
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,240
We didn't find anything.

184
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,160
Although we've confirmed

185
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,790
that Luca is an escaped criminal of Hermes,

186
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
looking at his current behavior,

187
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,270
he's just shopping, dating, eating

188
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,280
every day.

189
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,890
What do you think

190
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
he's waiting for?

191
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,109
Could it be that Hermes still has residual forces?

192
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,569
Is he waiting for the call of those forces?

193
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,470
I've investigated through intelligence.

194
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,070
Hermes' intelligence stations and personnel

195
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,400
around the globe have all been disbanded.

196
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,310
The core figure in our country,

197
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,270
Sander Bowie, has also been arrested.

198
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,110
So this is almost impossible.

199
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
Then why did he stay?

200
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,570
It seems long-distance surveillance

201
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,580
hasn't yielded good results.

202
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,210
We need to find another way.

203
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,920
I'll apply to Director Zhang

204
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,450
to see if we can use technical investigation.

205
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,440
When will it be implemented?

206
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,700
Don't get excited yet.

207
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,370
Wait for Director Zhang's approval.

208
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,280
Right,

209
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,790
I've been thinking about

210
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,320
what you told me these days.

211
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,920
You said that person who seems to be Luca

212
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,050
sprained his ankle,

213
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,670
and it was quite serious.

214
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,230
Can we

215
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,200
create an opportunity

216
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,960
to observe Luca up close?

217
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,440
This way we can determine

218
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,000
if he's the one who's been tailing me and Director Zhang.

219
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,830
Good idea.

220
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,790
Honey,

221
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,350
let's play badminton tomorrow.

222
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,150
Why do you suddenly want to play?

223
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,070
Yang Guang

224
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,240
sent me a message.

225
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,680
He said it's been a while since we played,

226
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,550
so he asked me out to play badminton.

227
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,680
I thought

228
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,790
it's been a long time

229
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,720
since I've participated in group activities,

230
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,240
so I agreed.

231
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,000
Go ahead then.

232
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,970
I'm not familiar with them.

233
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,030
Let's go together.

234
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,240
You'll get to know each other.

235
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,160
He is very easy-going.

236
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,830
Besides, you've been sitting around all day.

237
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,880
It's a good way to exercise your neck.

238
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,680
Listen,

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,680
badminton is a great sport.

240
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,270
But

241
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,400
I really don't like playing.

242
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,070
Come on, just go with me.

243
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,510
Since we were together,

244
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,310
I've been around you every day.

245
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,200
My friends

246
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,100
can barely see me anymore.

247
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,270
I feel like I've become someone

248
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,000
who abandons friends for love.

249
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,550
I don't want them to see me that way.

250
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
Although we're indeed happy together,

251
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,480
we

252
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,400
can't live in a vacuum after all.

253
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,200
We still need friends.

254
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,960
Am I right?

255
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,960
I really want my friends to see

256
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,730
how handsome and talented

257
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,960
my boyfriend is,

258
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,480
and how happy we are.

259
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,550
Fine.

260
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,920
I'll go with you.

261
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,550
Really?

262
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,920
I'll get ready.

263
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,440
Honey, it's time to go.

264
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
Coming now.

265
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,110
Division Director Yang, the target has set off.

266
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,790
Move now.

267
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,880
Take cover.

268
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,480
Got it.

269
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,400
Radio test.

270
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,440
Radio test.

271
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,400
Clear.

272
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,160
Radio test.

273
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,460
The sound is clear.

274
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,830
Radio test.

275
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,200
Clear.

276
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,030
Okay.

277
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,450
Are you done?

278
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,410
Let's go.

279
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,440
Coming.

280
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,730
Xiaoman.

281
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,750
Here.

282
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm sorry.

283
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,440
There was a traffic jam.

284
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,510
How long have you been waiting?

285
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,960
No, we just got here.

286
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,350
Mr. Luca.

287
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,350
Nice to meet you again.

288
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,830
Hello.

289
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,720
Mr. Yang.

290
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,440
Hello.

291
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,030
Hello, Mr. Luca.

292
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,110
I'm Li Jian.

293
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,310
We met last time.

294
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,920
Right here.

295
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,070
You came to pick up Xiaoman.

296
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,400
Mr. Li Jian?

297
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:50,750
Yes.

298
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,240
You met here last time.

299
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,440
You must be Mr. Yang's good friend.

300
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:56,970
Friend.

301
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:57,960
Friend.

302
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,920
Nice to meet you.

303
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,270
I'm Luca Mori.

304
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,410
Nice to meet you.

305
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,350
Hello. Hello.

306
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,720
Mr. Luca.

307
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,440
Have some water.

308
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,720
I brought my own.

309
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm used to drinking this.

310
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,590
Got it.

311
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,250
Why is your Chinese so good?

312
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,810
When did you come to China?

313
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,000
I've been to China

314
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,920
many times for work.

315
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,750
Mmm.

316
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,030
But learning Chinese is not easy.

317
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,830
Yes.

318
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,200
Where is your hometown?

319
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,200
Do you know the Kuwei Islands?

320
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
Oh.

321
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,830
No idea.

322
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,570
It's a small island.

323
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,880
I heard you're a writer.

324
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,550
When's your new book coming out?

325
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,610
I'd like to read it.

326
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,880
Soon.

327
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,440
Mr. Li Jian, you must be very busy.

328
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,440
Yes.

329
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,920
Xiaoman told me that Mr. Yang is a businessman.

330
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,350
Yes.

331
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,880
Then what do you do?

332
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,640
We are the same.

333
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,830
We cooperate.

334
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:56,680
Cooperate?

335
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,740
But I'm a supplier.

336
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,270
It's quite busy,

337
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,310
-running around. -It's quite good.

338
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,480
Everyone has their own life.

339
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,160
Yes.

340
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,400
Nice shot!

341
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,160
Go for it!

342
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,770
Here, have some water.

343
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,790
Thank you.

344
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
How have you been

345
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,400
lately?

346
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,240
All good.

347
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,240
I can tell.

348
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,310
Your eyes

349
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,140
are all about Mr. Luca.

350
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,510
We want to get married.

351
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,240
Luca said

352
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
after some time,

353
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,480
we plan to immigrate to the US.

354
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,590
US?

355
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,630
What's wrong?

356
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,240
No.

357
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
Why wouldn't Mr. Luca return to his own country?

358
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,830
Why immigrate to the US?

359
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,030
Because he's preparing for his next work.

360
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,030
He wants to write a novel

361
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,960
about Asians striving in America,

362
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
so he needs to do some field research.

363
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,240
Just wait for me to get ready.

364
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,830
Good.

365
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,240
Enough about me.

366
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,920
Is there any progress between you and Ms. Zhao?

367
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,200
You're not young anymore.

368
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,110
Still single?

369
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,820
Don't move.

370
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,110
Don't move at all.

371
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,270
I'm telling you,

372
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,750
your current expression

373
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,110
and tone

374
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
are just like my mom.

375
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,920
How old are you?

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,880
How old is she?

377
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,160
You're just like her.

378
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,530
Can you stop gossiping?

379
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,000
Stop pushing me to get married.

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,830
Hurry up.

381
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,310
Go for it!

382
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,400
Luca.

383
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,590
You…

384
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,350
Honey.

385
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,160
Honey, are you okay?

386
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,240
I'm fine.

387
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
I just sprained my ankle.

388
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
Do you need to go to the hospital?

389
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,880
No.

390
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,440
We'll just go home and apply some ice.

391
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,110
Sorry.

392
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,490
I really didn't mean it.

393
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,890
I'm really fine.

394
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,140
It's normal when playing.

395
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
It has nothing to do with you.

396
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,480
It's okay.

397
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,550
Sorry

398
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,440
to interrupt your mood.

399
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,960
Health comes first.

400
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,920
Let's reschedule another day

401
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,050
when you're better.

402
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,200
Okay.

403
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm leaving.

404
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,930
Bye. Take care.

405
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,710
Thank you.

406
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,310
Easy.

407
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,310
I'm okay.

408
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,830
Okay, let's meet another day.

409
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,490
Safe drive.

410
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,530
He came here walking fast,

411
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,480
and jumped around

412
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,080
when playing inside.

413
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,270
Given this situation,

414
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,750
he's not the one

415
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,270
who followed me two days ago.

416
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,200
I think

417
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,920
he sprained his ankle on purpose.

418
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,480
Even people who don't exercise wouldn't do that.

419
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,000
He sprained his ankle on purpose in front of us.

420
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
He did that for only one purpose,

421
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,400
to prove in front of us

422
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,310
he's not the one

423
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,910
who was following me before.

424
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,790
There's one thing I don't get.

425
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,490
Before he sprained his ankle,

426
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
how did he manage not to limp?

427
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,660
He must have had an injection.

428
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,590
If that's the case,

429
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,190
this guy's pretty ruthless.

430
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,680
Okay, let's go.

431
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,350
By the way,

432
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,960
when you were playing badminton,

433
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,020
Xie Xiaoman told me

434
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,640
Luca wants to take her to immigrate to the US,

435
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,960
for research.

436
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,110
US?

437
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,400
After she told me,

438
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,680
I've been thinking.

439
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,110
Leader has a branch in the US.

440
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,200
Luca, a Kuwei Islander,

441
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,000
not going back home but to the US,

442
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,480
do you think there's any

443
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,880
connection with Leader?

444
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,110
Could Luca have been recruited by Leader?

445
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,090
If that's the case,

446
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,720
it would explain

447
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,550
why Luca didn't return home

448
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,350
after Hermes was wiped out,

449
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,610
but stayed in Yanping.

450
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,400
Could he already

451
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,550
be James's man?

452
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,480
Hello?

453
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,110
Boss.

454
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,350
You and Li Jian

455
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,790
come over here right away.

456
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,070
Yes.

457
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,970
Do you recognize this person?

458
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,070
I can't tell.

459
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,130
The night before yesterday at 9 p.m.,

460
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,080
he went to the airport to get the airline package.

461
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
The passport and photo matched.

462
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,120
But the staff at the airport

463
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,240
felt there was something wrong with him.

464
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,370
So they did a recheck

465
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,720
and found

466
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,740
the passport was real,

467
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,430
but the person it belonged to

468
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,410
had passed away six months ago.

469
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,790
After analysis by physical

470
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,720
and facial recognition experts,

471
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,800
it was basically confirmed

472
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,400
that the person using the passport now,

473
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,640
this person

474
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,210
is the president of Leader Group,

475
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,000
James.

476
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,510
What did he pick up?

477
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,110
A latest microwave oven.

478
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,790
Are you kidding?

479
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,050
Importing a microwave oven from so far away?

480
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,880
Okay.

481
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,030
I'll be ready to receive the package.

482
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,510
This is the recording from that day you went to James's house.

483
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,000
So

484
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,110
what exactly is this microwave?

485
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,070
How many packages are there?

486
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,330
What's their purpose?

487
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,510
We must find out.

488
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,560
Understood.

489
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,270
Nuclear cooperation

490
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,930
is like an arrow on the string.

491
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,070
We must hurry.

492
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,240
How is it?

493
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,480
It's fine.

494
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,480
It doesn't hurt that much.

495
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,240
Let me see.

496
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,630
What's wrong?

497
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,750
There's a puncture wound

498
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,830
on your ankle.

499
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,300
A puncture?

500
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,310
How could that be?

501
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,440
You mean this?

502
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,950
It does look like a puncture,

503
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,790
but

504
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,920
who would inject here?

505
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,750
It must be

506
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,090
a tear from the shoe.

507
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,310
I'll buy you a more comfortable pair next time.

508
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,920
Look at your foot.

509
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,000
It's okay.

510
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,240
As a man,

511
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,510
I can bear this pain.

512
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,830
No way.

513
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,440
I can't let my boyfriend suffer.

514
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,160
I regret bringing you

515
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,440
to play badminton.

516
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,310
I should have listened to you and quit.

517
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm really fine.

518
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,840
I'm happy when I'm with you.

519
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,680
Fine.

520
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,510
You sit here.

521
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,610
I'll make you a pork trotter soup.

522
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,690
There's an old saying in China,

523
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,510
food and nutrition.

524
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,590
He must have had an injection.

525
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,250
No wonder he didn't feel pain.

526
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,210
He's really tough on himself.

527
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,360
This Xie Xiaoman is so stupid,

528
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,400
believing whatever he said.

529
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,440
That's why

530
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,360
love can lower one's IQ.

531
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,440
So you've been single,

532
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,290
afraid of becoming stupid?

533
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,590
Who?

534
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,000
Me?

535
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,260
You.

536
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,570
You're quite funny.

537
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,960
I wonder

538
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
what could make me stupid.

539
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,480
If not,

540
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,630
why don't you find a girlfriend?

541
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,159
It's none of your business.

542
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,360
Well,

543
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,590
I'm just concerned about you.

544
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,710
What kind of girl do you want?

545
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,030
I can give you some advice.

546
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,590
Mind your own business.

547
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,920
I don't need to worry about myself.

548
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,850
I'm still young.

549
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Why should I be anxious?

550
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,710
I'm anxious for you.

551
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,590
Do you know?

552
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,230
You're starting to look old.

553
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,070
Listen,

554
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,840
you better hurry up.

555
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,550
I still have a few besties.

556
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,440
I can introduce them to you.

557
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,230
If you're not in a hurry,

558
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,520
my besties will belong to someone else.

559
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,410
You have a lot of free time, right?

560
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,920
Well...

561
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,510
You worry a lot, right?

562
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,780
Let me tell you,

563
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,760
stay here for a week.

564
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,190
Keep an eye on it for a week here

565
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,670
to keep you from

566
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,910
these idle thoughts.

567
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,150
No.

568
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,230
I'll be stinky if I stay here for a week.

569
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,920
You're too old to find a girlfriend.

570
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,480
But it's not cool to repay kindness with ingratitude.

571
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,280
Am I old?

572
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,550
Stop it, you two.

573
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,730
There's new sound over there.

574
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
How does it taste?

575
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,150
It's good.

576
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,550
Thank you, Xiaoman.

577
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,620
It's great to have you.

578
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,550
This soup

579
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,670
reminds me of

580
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,230
when I was sick at the orphanage.

581
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,110
The head would make seaweed soup

582
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,590
and feed me one spoon at a time.

583
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,230
You grew up in an orphanage?

584
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,840
Didn't you tell me

585
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,440
you were with your parents on the Kuwei Island?

586
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,320
Yes,

587
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,180
we were in the Kuwei Islands then.

588
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,280
Later my parents went abroad to work,

589
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,070
all the elderly at home passed away,

590
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,030
so

591
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,760
I was fostered in the orphanage for a while.

592
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,630
I see.

593
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,480
Oh, right.

594
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,190
Is there any reply from the publishing house?

595
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,630
Not yet.

596
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,150
Just wait.

597
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,590
Alright.

598
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,820
I'll get you another bowl.

599
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,840
It looks like

600
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,190
a microcomputer-controlled microwave oven.

601
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,370
Check this out.

602
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,410
Primary switch.

603
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,230
Secondary switch.

604
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,360
Monitoring switch.

605
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,760
Oven thermostat.

606
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,320
Magnetron thermostat.

607
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,110
High-voltage transformer.

608
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,350
High-voltage diode.

609
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,860
High-voltage capacitor.

610
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,840
Grill tube.

611
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,840
Magnetron.

612
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,190
Fuse.

613
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,230
This part here

614
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,510
is the panel control chip.

615
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
This is

616
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,240
the temperature control chip.

617
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,550
This part...

618
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,800
Excuse me.

619
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,480
Experts,

620
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,530
to be honest,

621
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,110
I can't understand all this complexity.

622
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,920
My request is simple.

623
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
I just want to confirm

624
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,650
whether this is a real microwave oven

625
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,960
or just has the shell of a microwave oven

626
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,230
while the inside is actually other equipment.

627
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,190
All the other parts are normal.

628
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,650
But this part here,

629
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,760
which looks like

630
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,230
a chip with pins

631
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,440
inserted into the circuit board.

632
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,880
I can't figure out

633
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,360
its function.

634
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,510
It seems a bit redundant.

635
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,360
This chip shouldn't play a role

636
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,800
in the entire microwave oven's intelligent temperature

637
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,810
control system.

638
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,070
Can you determine

639
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,880
the level

640
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,760
of this chip?

641
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,000
No.

642
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,800
Because chips are used after

643
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,810
being packaged.

644
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,620
You can't tell any difference from the outside.

645
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,000
You have to get it in hand and conduct a test

646
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,920
to know.

647
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,720
So, can I understand it this way?

648
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,960
Theoretically,

649
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,360
this chip

650
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,800
shouldn't belong to this microwave oven.

651
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,600
That's right.

652
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,400
Yes,

653
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,550
it should be like that.

654
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,190
I see.

655
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,030
Hello,

656
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,190
Jack's delivery.

657
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,520
Okay, thank you.

658
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,710
Is there anyone named Jack in our company?

659
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,550
Ms. Zhao, this is specially instructed by Mr. James.

660
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,680
It's for his friend.

661
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I'll take it to him.

662
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,490
Ms. Zhao.

663
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,000
I see.

664
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,150
When did you change your name to Jack?

665
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,110
Why do you have it?

666
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,350
I brought it from the reception.

667
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,630
What is it?

668
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,030
So mysterious.

669
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,840
It's something needed for the next stage.

670
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,940
Sent by the headquarters.

671
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,920
You'll know then.

672
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,190
Okay.

673
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,320
The contract between Huaze Group and Taiyu Group

674
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
has been settled.

675
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,070
There's a signing ceremony this afternoon.

676
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,070
Mr. Xiang wants you to attend it too.

677
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,060
No problem.

678
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,510
This is a big deal.

679
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,880
I'll get ready.

680
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,400
Okay.

681
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,260
You want to use Division Three's technical methods

682
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,710
to help you enter James's office

683
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,480
and complete the investigation?

684
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
The time for nuclear power cooperation is imminent.

685
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,400
The signing ceremony will be held this afternoon.

686
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,530
After that, they will head to Lianhai.

687
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,550
At that time,

688
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,020
James received a mysterious device.

689
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,700
This is too sensitive.

690
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,190
And we have no idea

691
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,560
what this device is for.

692
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,030
We also don't know

693
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,630
what their ultimate plan is.

694
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,510
I think there must be many secrets

695
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,840
in James's office.

696
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,280
If we can find any useful clues,

697
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,810
we'll be in luck.

698
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,030
Okay.

699
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,190
I agree.

700
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,880
But you must be careful.

701
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,110
Don't alert them.

702
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,280
Understood.

703
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,770
This afternoon,

704
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,200
James and Zhao Yaning

705
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,760
will attend the signing ceremony between Huaze Group

706
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,690
and Taiyu Group.

707
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,150
This timing

708
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,500
is perfect.

709
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,630
They've got in the car.

710
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,560
They're about to leave the garage.

711
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,550
Hello.

712
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,150
Express delivery can't go in here.

713
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,070
There's a delivery cabinet over there.

714
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,800
Put it there.

715
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:15,800
No.

716
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,960
I'm delivering important documents.

717
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
The client has to sign for them in person.

718
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,360
Then call him and ask him to come down and sign.

719
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,630
I have. I've been calling.

720
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,110
19th floor,

721
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,480
Dada Network Technology Co., Ltd.

722
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,880
I've been calling for a long time, but no one answered.

723
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,810
Please, please.

724
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,510
This document is time-limited.

725
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,640
If I don't deliver it

726
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,550
within the time limit,

727
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,360
I'll be fined.

728
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
And I'll have to bear all the losses.

729
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,510
Could you let me go up there?

730
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,310
I'll come down right away, okay?

731
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,600
Please, please.

732
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,030
Alright, but hurry up.

733
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,030
Thank you.

734
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,240
They've arrived at Huaze Group.

735
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,920
Copy that.
