1
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,950
Bro.

2
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
James confessed.

3
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,680
Now the proceeding should be starting.

4
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,880
Espionage charges are confirmed.

5
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Luca's dead.

6
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,480
He got what he deserved.

7
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,950
Xie Xiaoman has become the key witness.

8
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,880
She's a bit unstable emotionally,

9
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,280
but at least she's safe now.

10
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,560
Also,

11
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,240
James' cane turned out

12
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
to be the key to the whole operation.

13
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,159
It looks like an ordinary cane,

14
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,870
but inside it has

15
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,720
an antenna made from a special conductor,

16
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,510
which is impossible to detect.

17
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,160
It was designed to receive important data

18
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,870
from the nuclear plant once it's up and running.

19
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,160
The assembly equipment left by Luca

20
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,000
is the receiver.

21
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Anyway,

22
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,680
we made it.

23
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,850
A couple of days ago,

24
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,520
the higher-ups talked to me.

25
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,310
They said they wanted to transfer me

26
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,630
and they promoted me to deputy division director.

27
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,580
I didn't accept it though.

28
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,070
I was thinking

29
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,710
that when we're together

30
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,170
I feel more at ease.

31
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
I still want to work with you.

32
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,830
Wake up soon,

33
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,560
we're all waiting for you to come back.

34
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,470
The Leader Group case

35
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,510
has been handed over to the department

36
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,040
for special case handling.

37
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,360
Division Three can close the case for now.

38
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,960
During this investigation,

39
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,130
the comrades from Division Three

40
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,600
were brave, tenacious,

41
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,370
fearless of sacrifice,

42
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
patient, steady,

43
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,800
and determined.

44
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,730
Thank you all

45
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,270
for your selfless contributions and sacrifices

46
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,730
in solving the Leader Group espionage case.

47
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,020
After discussions with senior leadership,

48
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,360
Division Three is awarded
a second-class collective merit.

49
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,600
Comrades Yang Guang

50
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,750
and Tian Ziwei are awarded

51
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,680
second-class individual merits.

52
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,480
Keep up the good work

53
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,270
and keep moving forward.

54
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,240
Defend the land,

55
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,990
and fulfill your duty

56
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,510
to protect the people and the country.

57
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,250
Everyone in Division Three

58
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,660
has done an excellent job.

59
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,370
Salute!

60
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,270
Tian.

61
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,030
Nurse.

62
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,270
Where...

63
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,000
Where's Tian Ziwei?

64
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,170
She might have gone for a check-up.

65
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,490
Thanks though.

66
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,150
Well.

67
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,550
I came here to thank you,

68
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,680
but you're not here.

69
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,670
What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,730
You don't want to hear me talk, do you?

71
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,510
Let me tell you.

72
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
That day with Luca,

73
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,070
we both sank into the sea.

74
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,960
We were both suffocating.

75
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,090
I just kept sinking,

76
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
but then I suddenly thought of you.

77
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
I thought about you

78
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,960
falling into the sea.

79
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,630
I was so worried.

80
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,170
I immediately woke up.

81
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,910
And I started swimming up.

82
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,870
I have no idea where the strength came from,

83
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,840
but I made it to the surface.

84
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,650
It was amazing.

85
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
I never thought I could do it.

86
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,670
Actually,

87
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,150
I didn't just come to thank you.

88
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,370
During the time you've been in the hospital,

89
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,750
I felt like the whole world went quiet.

90
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,790
I didn't enjoy it

91
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,080
at all.

92
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,380
It even makes me a bit anxious.

93
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,200
Back then,

94
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,860
why did I always joke about
you talking too much?

95
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
But honestly, your voice is actually really nice.

96
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,460
I like listening to it.

97
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,080
I like it.

98
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Just the voice?

99
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,250
When did you come in?

100
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,930
I didn't even hear your footsteps.

101
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,240
I think your voice sounds really nice now.

102
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,280
Keep talking.

103
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,270
What's with the silence?

104
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,750
You were talking non-stop earlier.

105
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,790
Keep going.

106
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,180
Do you only like the voice?

107
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,070
What else do you like?

108
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,970
Comrade Tian Ziwei.

109
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,630
This is the second-class medal of honor

110
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,290
awarded to you by the country.

111
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,610
Thank you, leader.

112
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,750
Anyway, you heard everything earlier.

113
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,720
I just want to tell you,

114
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,550
you're my medal.

115
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,520
Is that okay?

116
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,680
What do you mean?

117
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,750
I like you.

118
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,750
Is that okay?

119
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,890
Give me a clear answer.

120
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,390
Why are you so fierce

121
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,920
when you confess your love?

122
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,850
I get it.

123
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,760
But honestly, I kind of like it.

124
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,550
Ah.

125
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,430
Why didn't you say that earlier?

126
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,780
You're quite good with words.

127
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,720
Say it again.

128
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,840
I won't say it again.

129
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,970
I'll only say it once in this lifetime.

130
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,630
Zhao Yaning.

131
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,080
Behind you.

132
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,870
Careful!

133
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,910
You're awake.

134
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,510
You can't move yet.

135
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,960
Let me help you lie down.

136
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,360
How did I end up here?

137
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,510
You were unconscious.

138
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,970
Someone brought you here.

139
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
How long have I been unconscious?

140
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,050
It's been 3 days.

141
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
Who brought me here?

142
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
A woman.

143
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,480
Her name's Zhao Yaning.

144
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,510
She was injured too.

145
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,770
She's in the next room.

146
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,320
Sir, you can't pull it out.

147
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,790
You're not fully recovered yet.

148
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,390
Sir.

149
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,360
You can't run, Sir.

150
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,480
You're awake.

151
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,360
Where is she?

152
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,630
She's gone.

153
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,320
How could

154
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,780
a person be gone like that?

155
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,110
It's not that kind of 'gone'.

156
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,630
Where is she now?

157
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,850
You've been out for 3 days.

158
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,080
Let's go outside for a walk.

159
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
I kept this from you for a bit.

161
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,000
It's time for you to know everything now.

162
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,670
Everything Zhao Yaning said was true.

163
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,000
She's one of us.

164
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,000
She's from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

165
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,930
A member of the Jiangshan Project.

166
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,340
Her codename is

167
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,120
Jiangshan 2047.

168
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,480
The Jiangshan Project?

169
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,760
What's that?

170
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,440
It's a talent development program

171
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,910
designed to protect

172
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,320
our country's interests and security.

173
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,730
Only a few people know about it.

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,460
Zhao Yaning's superior is

175
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,430
Chairman Xie,

176
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,080
Xie Rujun?

177
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes.

178
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
Many years ago,

179
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,390
when Chairman Xie was still working

180
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,510
in Chinese Ministry of State Security,

181
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,570
he already foresaw

182
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
that future China

183
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,880
would have greater development

184
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,670
and would also face more severe international situations.

185
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,120
It was necessary to prepare in advance

186
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,450
to meet the challenges.

187
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,360
So,

188
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,820
on the surface,

189
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,130
Chairman Xie resigned

190
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,960
from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

191
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,820
But in reality,

192
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,030
he used his position as the president of

193
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,270
the Jiangcheng International Trade Association as a cover,

194
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,670
while continuing to handle top-secret missions.

195
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,530
He would select qualified people

196
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,360
from the State Security,

197
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,000
train them rigorously,

198
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,680
and send them to the frontlines
of intelligence operations

199
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,609
to protect the nation's security.

200
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,550
That was

201
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,440
the Jiangshan Project,

202
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,310
a program to nurture talents of State Security.

203
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,270
Back then,

204
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,790
Zhao Yaning was chosen by Chairman Xie

205
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,240
because of her exceptional language skills

206
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,829
and excellent adaptability.

207
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,510
Chairman Xie is her superior.

208
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,400
But isn't Chairman Xie still in a deep coma

209
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,550
in Jiangcheng Hospital?

210
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,250
That was a long time ago.

211
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,240
He woke up?

212
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,510
Yes, half a month ago.

213
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,680
He contacted me,

214
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,480
and that's when

215
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,910
I knew about Jiangshan 2047.

216
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,500
I also learned that

217
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,510
Zhao Yaning was one of us,

218
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,330
She specializes in long-line missions.

219
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,680
But for your safety,

220
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,160
it was best to maintain the current situation.

221
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,290
So I didn't tell you.

222
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,510
At that time,

223
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,610
we decided you'd continue with the case.

224
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,750
Jiangshan 2047

225
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,010
would remain by James's side.

226
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,310
I would only tell you when necessary.

227
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,160
To sacrifice you short-term undercover agent

228
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,480
to protect the long-term one.

229
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
I understand.

230
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,170
So nothing like that happened,

231
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,800
which is why you didn't tell me.

232
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,880
Exactly.

233
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,810
You had already started your work.

234
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,720
Fortunately,

235
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,420
at the crucial moment,

236
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
she stepped forward.

237
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Where is she now?

238
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,380
That's highly confidential.

239
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,130
I can't tell you.

240
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,830
Come in.

241
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,720
Mr. Xie, long time no see.

242
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,430
It hasn't been that long.

243
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,680
Jiangshan 2047,

244
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,440
you've worked hard.

245
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,270
It's thanks to our last meeting

246
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,650
that a lot of things
went much more smoothly afterward.

247
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:19,030
The private room is ready.
Dinner's prepared.

248
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,020
Please come in.

249
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,200
Mr. Xie.

250
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,530
You're finally awake.

251
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,240
You've worked hard.

252
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,200
After you woke up and contacted me,

253
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,030
I learned that Yang Guang
and the others would also be coming to Lianhai.

254
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,430
That kept me from being alone in this fight.

255
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,100
This operation's success is also thanks to you.

256
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,240
Lady.

257
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,110
Who are you looking for?

258
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,960
Are you sure everything's okay?

259
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,990
Yes, everything's fine.

260
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,790
It's been hard on you.

261
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,830
I know that you've done a lot

262
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,020
since you arrived in Jiangcheng.

263
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,240
I've arrived.

264
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,610
Everything is fine.

265
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,310
It's been arranged.

266
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,310
Tomorrow, 9 AM.

267
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,240
Okay.

268
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,440
Remember.

269
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,790
No matter the outcome,

270
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,110
report it to me.

271
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,830
Also, keep a close eye on them.

272
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,660
They're up to take something.

273
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,070
Handle any problem once they come up.

274
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,590
I'll take care of it.

275
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,810
When we talk later,

276
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,270
make sure you all

277
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,920
write it down as much as you can.

278
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,030
Including the key points in his words.

279
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,760
It's best if you can make notes.

280
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,920
Hello, the number you've dialed is currently…

281
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,510
I've arrived, you can contact me.

282
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Two hours after the meeting. Jiangcheng Park.

283
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,920
The time I went to Jiangcheng to see you,

284
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,200
I was there to report

285
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,480
the intel on Leader's plan to

286
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,540
act on the Gen-4 nuclear energy tech.

287
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,690
I didn't expect you to suddenly have an accident.

288
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,650
At that time, I was really worried.

289
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,690
I thought you might never wake up.

290
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
But thankfully,

291
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,350
even under those difficult circumstances,

292
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,400
you didn't forget your identity

293
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,790
and continued to carry out your mission.

294
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,550
Since things have happened,

295
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,510
I have no other choice.

296
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,310
I have to keep going.

297
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,570
The Leader's plan was always deeply hidden.

298
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,880
They initially had me make contact with Hermes.

299
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,880
So besides maintaining the status quo,

300
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,550
I also had to keep a close eye on Hermes.

301
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,720
The problem was

302
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,030
Yang Guang started

303
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,830
focusing on me at that same time.

304
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,070
This comrade is good.

305
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,070
He figured out right away

306
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,870
that my identity wasn't simple.

307
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,680
So during that time,

308
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,510
I had to follow
the actions of Sander and his team,

309
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,820
while also carrying out James's instructions.

310
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,650
At the same time, I had to figure out

311
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,980
how to shake off Yang Guang's suspicion.

312
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,240
I really don't know

313
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,160
how I got through it.

314
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,030
In that case,

315
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,510
those tests I thought were smart

316
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,110
might have actually harmed her.

317
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,680
Have we

318
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,160
met before?

319
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,580
She really went through a lot.

320
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,960
But from a professional standpoint,

321
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,510
she's been playing the role of an intelligence trader

322
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,790
in all of this.

323
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,590
And every move has been spot on.

324
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,920
Back then,

325
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,010
she was the smartest

326
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,000
and most outstanding young person.

327
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,440
That's why we chose her

328
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,550
to complete the Jiangshan Plan.

329
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Looking at it now,

330
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,310
she couldn't have been a better fit.

331
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,420
The Jiangshan Project

332
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,030
is the highest-level secret
in the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

333
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,690
All members only contact their supervisors.

334
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,720
And only they know who their superior is.

335
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,810
When we initially recruited Zhao Yaning,

336
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,220
we hoped that she could

337
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,590
become a sharp blade we could

338
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,520
insert into the heart of the enemy.

339
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,960
She doesn't need to accept special missions

340
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,510
or frequently contact us.

341
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,480
She only needs to play her role
at critical moments

342
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,380
to protect national security

343
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,010
and interests at any cost.

344
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,330
I'll keep doing what I've always done.

345
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Defending the nation's interests.

346
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,110
I'm not afraid of

347
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,510
whoever wants to harm me.

348
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,550
Because I know

349
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,590
my country has my back.

350
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,730
So everything she displayed,

351
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
persuading Luca,

352
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,790
facilitating nuclear power cooperation,

353
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,400
cooperating with James's defection plan,

354
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,270
testing me,

355
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,490
and those things that only spies would do,

356
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,040
were all because she had to do so.

357
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,050
She had to pretend to be one of the enemy

358
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,370
without making a single misstep.

359
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,590
Sometimes,

360
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,550
she even had to deliberately cooperate with them

361
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,790
to sabotage our operations.

362
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,400
Right?

363
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,480
If the facts and evidence don't prove it,

364
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,080
will you still trust me?

365
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,150
If the facts and evidence

366
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,640
don't prove it,

367
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,840
should I still trust you?

368
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,830
I hope you trust me.

369
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,720
But they killed Mr. Sun.

370
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,560
I honestly didn't expect that.

371
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,270
But you can't blame yourself for that.

372
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,550
I blame myself.

373
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,880
During that time,

374
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,550
you were in the hospital, unconscious.

375
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,880
And I had no one to contact.

376
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,830
I couldn't be sure

377
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,360
that every step I took was the right one.

378
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
It felt like

379
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,960
walking in the dark.

380
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,510
But in the end, you kept going.

381
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Instead of just saying I kept going,

382
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,960
it was more like an instinct.

383
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,410
I've been playing Zhao Yaning

384
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,510
for so long.

385
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,310
I almost forgot who I really am.

386
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,170
Thankfully, there was Yang Guang.

387
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,440
He made me feel like I was truly myself.

388
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,960
He made me feel that

389
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,030
I wasn't fighting alone

390
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,970
and having a comrade by my side.

391
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,350
You've got along well with him, huh?

392
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,340
He's someone I trust completely.

393
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,680
So when did you

394
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,440
realize his identity?

395
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,650
Actually, the first time I met him,

396
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,590
I think I knew that.

397
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,840
Later, at Jianyu Mountain,

398
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
when he formally introduced himself to me.

399
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,650
Let me introduce myself again.

400
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,850
I'm Yang Guang
from the Yanping State Security Bureau.

401
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,080
My feelings were complicated.

402
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,550
On the one hand, I was excited

403
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,540
to finally confirm his identity.

404
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,830
But on the other hand,

405
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
I felt unbalanced.

406
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,720
I envied him.

407
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,240
I envied how he could proudly

408
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,030
introduce himself with his real identity.

409
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,830
But I couldn't.

410
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,400
I could only say my name to him in my heart.

411
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,440
And let him know

412
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,240
I stand with him.

413
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,880
Like him,

414
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,510
I also had a police badge hidden in my heart.

415
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm deeply grateful to all comrades from

416
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
the Chinese Ministry of State Security,
fighting on the covert frontlines.

417
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,070
Their actions prove one thing.

418
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,160
Justice is never absent.

419
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
Do you

420
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,590
regret it?

421
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,350
I've never regretted it.

422
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,070
It was my choice

423
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,680
and my promise.

424
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,770
You've worked hard.

425
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,880
It's because of people like you

426
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,520
that we can keep moving forward.

427
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
So, where should I go now?

428
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,510
Are

429
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,720
you willing?

430
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,830
I'm willing.

431
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,640
This is my mission.

432
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,030
I also want to ask you

433
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
about you and him…

434
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,660
Let's not talk about that.

435
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,070
We both

436
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,000
have more important things to do.

437
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,750
Yang Guang.

438
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,240
I know you're feeling conflicted.

439
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,750
But I need to tell you.

440
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,530
Everything you've done has been worth it.

441
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,520
You've never let the Party
or the country down.

442
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,880
You are unsung heroes.

443
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
What I've done is just part of my job.

444
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
She's the real unsung hero.

445
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,930
Director Zhang.

446
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Could you arrange for me to meet her?

447
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,750
Just one meeting.

448
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,920
She's off to carry out a new mission.

449
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,450
She must have already left.

450
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,960
She got another mission so soon?

451
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,000
When will she be back?

452
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,070
Well.

453
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,830
I can't answer.

454
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,350
Mr. Xie.

455
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,270
Take care.

456
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,960
See you next time.

457
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,230
The long wind will break the waves, and in time,

458
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,290
success will come.

459
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,250
Success will come.

460
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,360
By the way, Mr. Xie.

461
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,670
Did you pass on the things

462
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,960
I gave Yang Guang?

463
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,030
Don't worry.

464
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,290
It's all taken care of.

465
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,510
Here's a letter she left for you.

466
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,670
I know.

467
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,880
You two share a special bond.

468
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Because you two

469
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,600
are the same kind of person.

470
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,740
I hope you understand all of this.

471
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,230
Yang Guang.

472
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,590
Right now, it's raining outside.

473
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,320
And I'm reminded of

474
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,150
the day we ate instant noodles
by the roadside.

475
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,670
Although we're used to
parting without goodbyes,

476
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,320
knowing that you'll only ever know my identity,

477
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
not my name,

478
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,080
I can't help but feel a bit sentimental.

479
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,110
You don't know

480
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,230
that we've known each other for a long time.

481
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,600
We both entered
the International College the same year.

482
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,800
Right now,

483
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,840
even though I've long
let go of my real name,

484
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,480
the name Zhao Yaning

485
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,800
represents my mission.

486
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,280
I think

487
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,090
the reason people are fearless

488
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,440
is because they carry faith in their hearts

489
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,030
on a thorny path.

490
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,480
The days in Yanping

491
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,760
were like walking in the dark.

492
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,780
But fortunately, you were there,

493
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,480
accompanying me like a warm beam of light,

494
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
illuminating the path ahead

495
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,440
and illuminating me.

496
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,510
Thank you.

497
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,510
My teammate.

498
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,320
My comrade.

499
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,720
From now on, we part ways.

500
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,150
We're heading in different directions.

501
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,510
We'll return to our parallel paths.

502
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,670
Looking back at the desolate place,

503
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,710
I return

504
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,760
to find neither storm nor sunshine.

505
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,030
You and I

506
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,220
will never walk alone.

507
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,590
Zhao Yaning.

508
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,320
Welcome, what can I get you today?

509
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,070
Coffee, please.

510
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,510
Okay.

511
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,280
No. 1 is in position.

512
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,830
Everything is fine out here.

513
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,030
No suspicious persons were found

514
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,590
within the monitoring range.
