1
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,440
Please do me a favor.

2
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,940
I have to deliver this file

3
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,120
within a certain time period,

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,950
or my pay

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
will be docked.

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
I'll have to bear all the losses too.

7
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,950
Please let me go upstairs.

8
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,350
I'll be right down, okay?

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,789
Please.

10
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,530
Fine. Get it done quickly.

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,479
Thank you.

12
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,670
They've arrived at Huaze Group.

13
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,520
Copy that.

14
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,870
Ms. Ma,

15
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,690
is the vision clear?

16
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,930
Yes, very clear.

17
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,220
Roger that.

18
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,260
[The copying will be finished in 54 minutes]

19
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,870
Your country has finally started
putting nuclear power

20
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,600
technology to commercial use.

21
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,310
Our efforts finally paid off

22
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,960
after so many setbacks.

23
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,070
Next, you'll conduct

24
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,830
field inspections, right?

25
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,470
Yes.

26
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,270
We're going to inspect

27
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,830
Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant in three days.

28
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,920
We'll wait for the notice then.

29
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,170
No problem.

30
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,120
Pleasure working with you.

31
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,040
Have a nice day.

32
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,800
Okay.

33
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,290
[The copying will be finished in 35 minutes]

34
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,390
Division Director Yang,

35
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,320
the targets have left Huaze Group.

36
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,570
When will they arrive here?

37
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,160
At the current rate,

38
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,370
in about 40 minutes.

39
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,420
Enough time for me.

40
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
Let me know when they reach

41
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,170
the parking lot.

42
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,720
Got it.

43
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,200
Ms. Ma，

44
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,960
find out

45
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,180
what kind of a safe this is,

46
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,960
and if it can be cracked.

47
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,670
It's the TDXG35 model.

48
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,440
It won't open until it identifies

49
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,550
the correct code, fingerprints and irises.

50
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,080
We can't crack it.

51
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,960
Got it.

52
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,320
[The copying will be finished in 25 minutes]

53
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,480
What are you looking at?

54
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,120
Nothing.

55
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm feeling a bit emotional.

56
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,630
We started working on this

57
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,410
a long time ago.

58
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
Finally, we've reached the payoff moment.

59
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,010
We're one step away from victory.

60
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,850
At this time,

61
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,290
we must not let our guard down.

62
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,520
I understand.

63
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,210
I need to set out for Lianhai in three days, right?

64
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,740
Yes.

65
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,880
I'll make an itinerary.

66
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Wait to hear from me.

67
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,440
Okay.

68
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,750
[The copying will be finished in 4 minutes]

69
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,390
Division Director Yang,

70
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,720
the targets have reached the parking lot.

71
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm on the 23rd floor.

72
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,270
The elevator goes up a floor in three seconds.

73
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,470
I need about a minute.

74
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,280
Can you stall them for a minute?

75
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,550
The clock is ticking.

76
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,630
Time is running out.

77
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,270
Got it.

78
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,830
[The copying will be finished in 3 minutes and 40 seconds]

79
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,110
[The copying will be finished in 2 minutes and 30 seconds]

80
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,600
[The copying will be finished in 2 minutes]

81
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,530
Hello, Mr. Zhan.

82
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,410
Anything wrong?

83
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,440
Nothing.

84
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,030
To our early wins.

85
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,320
We must keep our guard up.

86
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,490
They're breathing down our necks these days.

87
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,720
I might need you

88
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,080
to pick up the next delivery for me.

89
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,960
Sure, no problem.

90
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,970
Go back to your work.

91
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,580
I have issues to deal with.

92
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,530
I'm leaving now.

93
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay.

94
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,670
This is the footage of the past two hours.

95
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,270
I'll play it at double speed.

96
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,670
I'd like to see

97
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,230
what you recorded in the lobby two hours

98
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,330
before I came back.

99
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,130
Did something happen?

100
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm not sure yet.

101
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,120
Ms. Ma,

102
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,930
the time ran out

103
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,080
before

104
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,810
I finished copying

105
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,840
all the data.

106
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,870
I'll be back

107
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,510
in the office in about 20 minutes.

108
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,710
I'll talk to you then.

109
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,960
This is the hard drive data on James' computer.

110
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,630
I needed two more minutes

111
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,470
to complete the copying.

112
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,360
But I already got 91% of all the data.

113
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,420
Check it carefully

114
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,030
and see if there is a new finding.

115
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,480
Okay.

116
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,390
Can the information on this note be recovered?

117
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,320
No.

118
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,600
That's heat-sensitive paper.

119
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,790
It turns dark when it meets fire.

120
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,390
There's no way to reverse it.

121
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,690
Check the hard drive data then.

122
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,340
What about you?

123
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,510
Any new findings?

124
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,550
We're monitoring the phones that James,

125
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,210
Taylor, Li Taiheng and Zhao Yaning usually use.

126
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,300
But no delivery records can be found.

127
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,150
The name of the package recipient at the airport is fake.

128
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,010
I'm sure they use several phones.

129
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,750
All we can do is keep watch on them now.

130
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:55,790
Hey.

131
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,150
I don't mind you making some noise.

132
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,150
You know?

133
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,610
You don't have to...

134
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,150
Listen,

135
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,260
you can't really taste

136
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,970
the crisps if you crunch them.

137
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,069
What nonsense is that?

138
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,829
When you eat discreetly,

139
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,400
you can't let out a sound, right?

140
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,829
Yes?

141
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,550
It means you have to slowly

142
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,589
chew the crisps.

143
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,550
That's how you get the real taste of them.

144
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,680
Gosh.

145
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,589
What an impressive theory.

146
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,310
Hello?

147
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,880
Any new findings?

148
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,030
Xie Xiaoman got

149
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,200
suspicious,

150
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,000
but Luca dispelled her doubts.

151
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,240
What did she say?

152
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,930
Would that endanger her life?

153
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,800
Don't worry.

154
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,070
She didn't let out much.

155
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,200
She found a needle mark on Luca's foot.

156
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,350
He then made up a story to convince her.

157
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,880
Make sure she is safe.

158
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,160
If they ever start

159
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
a physical conflict,

160
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,230
notify me right away.

161
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,640
Don't worry. We're listening in on them 24/7.

162
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,790
Team A and B are both on it.

163
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,390
Good work.

164
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,790
Buy some nice food for Tian.

165
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Don't starve her.

166
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,190
How is she?

167
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,350
Is she doing okay?

168
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,030
She's doing a good job eating.

169
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,160
What are you saying?

170
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,350
Do you have to tell him that?

171
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,920
What?

172
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,400
What do you mean by that?

173
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,440
I mean, she's doing

174
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,070
her job well.

175
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,070
Good.

176
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,660
Tian is very intelligent.

177
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,620
Smart, too.

178
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,510
Don't be a bad influence on her.

179
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,960
I won't be.

180
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,150
Rest assured. She won't starve.

181
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,640
Bye.

182
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,840
My goodness.

183
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,100
Nice stuff.

184
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,590
Uncle Li,

185
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,510
I have an important discovery.

186
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,110
What is it?

187
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,680
The reason

188
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,110
that you're still single

189
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,160
at this age.

190
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,240
I just told

191
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,830
the division director that you were doing great.

Can't you say something nice to me?

193
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
You want some crisps?

194
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,050

Thank you.

197
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,560
I'll go to the market

198
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,560

I'll follow her.

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:54,960
Take them off.

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,790
I'll follow Xie Xiaoman.

to you over a week ago.

217
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,960

that I couldn't find this manuscript.

229
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
sent to the Publishing Department?

Yes.

Because of the needle mark?

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,400
I don't think so.

267

Ms. Ma,

322
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,790
have you reached the club yet?

323
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,070
I'm almost there.

324
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,970
Still on my way.

325
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,550
James is wandering

326
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,240
in the mall.

327
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,880
There's a high chance

328
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,140
that he's just a decoy.

329
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,310
So,

330

The Skynet system shows Zhao's car is still in the club.

333
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,160

Division Director Yang,

345
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,640
Zhao's car is parked

346
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,100
near the club's rear door.

347
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,200
If she is to drive away,

348
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,730
she must use the front gate.

349
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,350
I'll stay there.

350
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,920
Don't lose track of her.

351
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,550
I won't.

353
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,400
Zhao's car is going out.

354
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,150
Tag along.

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,310
Hello.

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,510
Welcome.

Division Director Yang,

358
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,200
Zhao has returned to Leader Group.

359
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,480
Have you found anything unusual?

360
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,920
No.

361
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,270
She was in the club the whole time.

362
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,600
I've been watching her.

363
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,480
Go back to the office then.

364
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:02,880
Okay.

365
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Did you not get the parcel?

366
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,590
I did.

367
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,000
It's in my car.

368
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,830
I left it there to avoid it being filmed

369
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,240
by the surveillance cameras.

370
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,790
Let's go to the garage later.

371
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,070
I'll place it in your car.

372
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,510
Okay.

373
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,350
What is in the parcel?

374
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,110
Something we need

375
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,550
for the second phase.

376
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,880
What is it?

377
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,280
You'll know when it's time.

378
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,010
Can't you just tell me now?

379
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,480
I don't need all the details.

380
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,510
I went out on a limb for this stuff.

381
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,960
Don't I deserve to know

382
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,200
what it is?

383
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,350
I really can't

384
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
let you in on this.

385
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,510
I can only tell you

386
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,640
that I'll bring it to Lianhai.

387
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,000
When it happens,

388
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,840
I'll tell you what it is.

389
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,680
Is it for

390
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,430
the nuclear power plant?

391
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
Focus on your job.

392
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,350
Okay.

393
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,830
I got it.

394
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,170
Did anything happen on your trip?

395
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,750
A woman was following me.

396
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,720
I think she works for the State Security.

397
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,580
But she didn't find out anything.

398
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,240
When I picked up the previous parcel,

399
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,720
I used a fake passport.

400
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,010
Maybe I attracted their attention at that time.

401
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,480
Will it affect our future moves?

402
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,450
Don't worry.

403
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,160
For the time being, they have no evidence.

404
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,510
It's Xiang Taisheng.

405
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,750
Pick up the phone.

406
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,960
Mr. Xiang,

407
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,240
what's up?

408
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,490
I have some news for you.

409
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,680
Mr. Li of Taiyu Group

410
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,680
hopes to see

411
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,920
the HTGR

412
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,640
technologies

413
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,350
be put into practice as soon as possible.

414
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,590
We are

415
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,480
leaving for Lianhai tomorrow.

416
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,920
I hope you'll

417
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,350
get ready too.

418
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,920
No problem.

419
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,310
We can set off anytime.

420
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,680
See you in Lianhai.

421
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,440
Okay.

422
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,550
Victory is awaiting us.

423
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,880
How's it going?

424
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,150
Any findings?

425
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,760
There is a lot of data on the hard drive.

426
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,760
I used AI to scan

427
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,630
through the documents and found

428
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,020
all of them related to Leader Group's business.

429
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,880
There is no record of

430
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,440
deliveries or their so-called

431
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,230
intelligence plans.

432
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,920
James didn't collect any parcels.

433
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,520
He just loitered in the mall.

434
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,670
At the same time, Zhao Yaning went to a club.

435
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,929
Ma Qingli followed her

436
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,670
and found nothing peculiar.

437
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
All the group executives

438
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,360
stayed in the office the entire time.

439
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,110
We traced their delivery orders

440
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,640
and found nothing unusual.

441
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,280
After all the investigation,

442
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,940
we still couldn't find a clue.

443
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,020
We're stuck again.

444
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,030
It is not easy to achieve commercial

445
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,030
cooperation on the 4th-generation

446
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,400
nuclear power technology.

447
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,840
Catching spies is important.

448
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,900
So is this project.

449
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,800
Unless we have solid evidence,

450
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,230
it must go as planned.

451
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,890
I know what you mean.

452
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,170
I actually have an idea.

453
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,060
That is, we should stay quiet.

454
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,200
We won't alert them,

455
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,070
or expand the scope of investigation.

456
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,480
Just let the nuclear power cooperation continue.

457
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,590
Then, the spies will give themselves away.

458
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,850
However, to fight over safety concerns,

459
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,880
we can let James leave Yanping,

460
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,630
but what was mailed to him

461
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,290
must not reach Lianhai.

462
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,630
I understand.

463
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,390
Leader Group's plans

464
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
are more devious

465
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,320
and elusive

466
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,760
than Hermes'.

467
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,510
We must be thoroughly prepared.

468
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,360
I'll consult the brass.

469
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,840
Commissioner Zhao,

470
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,480
hello.

471
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,050
A situation came up.

472
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,280
I hope you can lend me a helping hand.

473
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,140
Can you arrange

474
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,760
a charter flight for Huaze Group,

475
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,880
so its partners can safely

476
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,380
arrive at Lianhai?

477
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,630
Hello?

478
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,750
What's up?

479
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,920
J, there's an emergency.

480
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,800
The board of directors of Huaze Group

481
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,530
thinks highly of this project.

482
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,670
It instantly organized a charter flight

483
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,670
to Lianhai for all the event attendees.

484
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,550
Tomorrow morning,

485
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,280
the representatives of Huaze Group and Taiyu Group,

486
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
as well as our staff,

487
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,080
will go to Lianhai on that plane.

488
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,010
This...

489
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
This is totally out of the blue.

490
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,210
Didn't we agree to drive there?

491
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,960
Yes.

492
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
I told Mr. Xiang about it,

493
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,120
but he was very determined.

494
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,800
Taiyu Group has agreed to the proposal,

495
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,150
so we have to say yes too.

496
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,070
J,

497
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,190
how are you going to

498
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,670
bring your stuff there?

499
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,270
The security check will be very strict.

500
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,410
Alright.

501
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,670
Well noted.

502
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,440
Okay.

503
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,150
Hey, boss.

504
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,400
I need your advice.

505
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,480
Due to the Chinese' plan,

506
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,280
I can't bring our equipment.

507
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,630
Now, this item can be broken up.

508
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,280
So,

509
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,230
I want the Whale to take it to Lianhai.

510
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
The Whale?

511
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,670
Are you sure?

512
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,960
Yeah.

513
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,880
I have the confidence to handle him.

514
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,400
Good.

515
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,190
Go ahead.

516
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,550
Got it.

517
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,960
Division Director Yang,

518
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,920
Zhao Yaning and James

519
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,880
got in a brown sedan

520
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,810
whose license plate ends with 900.

521
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,450
Li Taiheng didn't get in it.

522
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,550
They just left.

523
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,830
[I'm on a business trip. Call you in a few days.]

524
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,590
[Okay. Wish you the best of luck.]

525
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,440
Hello, Ms. Ma.

526
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,760
I haven't seen Taylor the whole day.

527
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,760
Find out where he is.

528
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm on it.

529
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,280
Speak up.
