1
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,729
Well, get some rest, Mr. Yang.

2
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,039
I'll be going now.

3
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,280
Thank you.

4
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,150
Alethea.

5
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,640
Bye-bye, Sonny.

6
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,280
What's going on?

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,860
Why is she here?

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,340
Why are you so late?

9
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,640
Ah.

10
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,180
Yang Guang was too dangerous.

11
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,610
We'll never see him again.

12
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,880
He's the Ministry of State Security's man. Is that okay?

13
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,870
Yeah. You know, accidents

14
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,190
happen all the time.

15
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,710
And because the Whale did it.

16
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,310
Nothing can be traced back to us.

17
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,310
Don't worry.

18
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,430
The whale has its ways.

19
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,470
He's also a very smart man.

20
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,470
That girl is his guardian angel.

21
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,430
Look, he's here.

22
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
I just want to ask you.

23
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Why didn't you answer my call?

24
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,000
I was unconscious, how could I answer?

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,860
You answered Zhao Yaning's call.

26
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,200
The doctor answered it.

27
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
When she called,

28
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
the doctor answered.

29
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,510
When you called,

30
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,630
the doctor didn't see it.

31
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,430
Just bad luck.

32
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,390
Well.

33
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,159
Couldn't you wait for me for a while

34
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,600
after you finished the phone call?

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,950
I was on my way.

36
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,390
At that time, the suspect

37
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,450
jumped out of the window and ran away.

38
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,310
I immediately chased after him.

39
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,480
The chance was fleeting.

40
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,870
I didn't have time to wait for you.

41
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,680
Just followed him.

42
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,330
What did you risk your life?

43
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,560
If the car were a little further,

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
we would never see each other again.

45
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,830
You're fine now, aren't you?

46
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,190
You have time now, right?

47
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,650
No more fleeting moments.

48
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,600
Concussion.

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,900
Bone fracture.

50
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,720
What?

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Golden partners?

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,000
I stay in the hospital once,

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,360
you have to stay once too.

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,920
Are we competing on this too?

55
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,310
Can you stop making me laugh?

56
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,800
This...

57
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,040
What's going on here?

58
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,920
Breathing my oxygen,

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,750
why do you still acting so recklessly?

60
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,240
Sorry.

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,260
Oh, by the way, I need to remind you of something.

62
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
To Zhao Yaning,

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm still the general manager of our trading company.

64
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
In case you meet her again,

65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,000
keep that in mind.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,300
Understood, Mr. Yang.

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Steven.

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,740
How many documents

69
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,360
did Sander Bowie and his people actually take

70
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,630
from Mr. Sun's villa?

71
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Have you investigated it clearly?

72
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,810
It's not very clear yet.

73
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,680
But according to Mrs. Sun,

74
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,750
what they took were all just drafts.

75
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,600
They're useless.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
The really useful ones

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,360
have all been sealed and sent to the research institute.

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
They absolutely can't access them.

79
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,230
That's great.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,320
It's a blessing in disguise.

81
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,640
Like hell it's good.

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
We were about to say our final goodbyes.

83
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,720
And you're saying it's great?

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,580
You just focus on getting better.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm fine.

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,750
Hurry up.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,110
Arrange for me to be transferred back quickly

88
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,640
to the hospital in Yanping.

89
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,920
Sander Bowie and his people's plans

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,830
won't stop.

91
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't worry.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,660
Everything's been arranged.

93
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,390
Oh my god.

94
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,480
How far did you run?

95
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,600
What are you doing?

96
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,920
This...

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,770
You can't be this eager to leave the hospital.

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,070
Haste makes waste.

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,530
Much better.

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,410
Much better.

101
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Stop looking at me so miserably, will you?

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
Promise me you won't train like this again, okay?

103
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,440
Let's talk business.

104
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,190
Since Sander returned to Yanping,

105
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,280
he's been behaving himself.

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Apart from normal business cooperation,

107
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,480
he's mostly stayed inside the Moss Trading Group.

108
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,190
It's not like he's really doing legitimate business.

109
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,270
He's just pretending every day.

110
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,130
Isn't he tired?

111
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,720
Is he planning his next move?

112
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,800
But I think

113
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,720
he doesn't have any loopholes to exploit anymore.

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,980
Don't underestimate this Sander Bowie.

115
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,040
For this matter,

116
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,850
he even dared to try to take my life.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
He's an old fox,

118
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,490
a slippery old eel.

119
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,240
He'll squeeze through any gap he finds.

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,900
We must not let our guard down.

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,570
What about Zhao Yaning?

122
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,650
Missing your benefactor?

123
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,010
Can you speak properly?

124
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,740
She's had several consecutive meetings with She Shiyuan.

125
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,160
The content of their conversations is unclear,

126
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
but judging from her expression, she seemed very disappointed.

127
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
It doesn't seem to be going well.

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,549
She's going on behalf of Sander Bowie, right?

129
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,080
Which means Sander Bowie hasn't given up yet.

130
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,390
But I think it's almost over.

131
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,909
Can't you say everything at once?

132
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,200
Stop making me ask you all the time.

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,260
Alright, alright.

134
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,360
She Shiyuan has proactively contacted Huaze Group.

135
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,910
He even applied to visit Huaze Group today.

136
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,670
I think Sander

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,570
has been completely defeated.

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,640
How's the surveillance?

139
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,960
Have you found the culprit?

140
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,750
It's not easy to find.

141
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,270
The perpetrator might be deliberately avoiding cameras.

142
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,200
The surveillance at the intersection where the accident occurred

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,270
is very old.

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,390
It's very blurry.

145
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,790
The surveillance from other intersections is the same.

146
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,390
From the angle of the driver,

147
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
the face is completely unclear.

148
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,730
After image enhancement,

149
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,490
this is the best we can get.

150
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,410
It's impossible to identify who this is.

151
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
Ms. Zhao,

152
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,000
do you need something?

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,670
Mr. She,

154
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,870
I do have

155
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,200
a very important matter

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
that I'd like to discuss with you in person.

157
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,870
Not today.

158
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm on my way to Jianyu Mountain.

159
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,270
Are you going hiking?

160
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,280
Yes, I am.

161
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,720
It's my way

162
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,950
of relieving stress.

163
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,910
I'm planning to stay here overnight.

164
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,870
I'll return to Yanping early tomorrow morning.

165
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,330
Let's meet tomorrow then.

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,690
Then I'll go to find you.

167
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,580
I think I need to relieve some stress too.

168
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,390
You want to go hiking as well?

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,550
But this place is a bit remote.

170
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,760
I'll still go to find you.

171
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Alright then.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,530
I'll send you the location.

173
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,240
Okay.

174
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,870
See you later then.

175
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,840
Mr. She.

176
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,790
Mr. She.

177
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,440
Ms. Zhao.

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,510
Mr. She.

179
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Your stamina is really impressive.

180
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,170
I really can't keep up with you.

181
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Ms. Zhao,

182
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
you came hiking,

183
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,480
why didn't you change your clothes?

184
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,240
These shoes,

185
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,340
these clothes,

186
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,600
they're really holding you back.

187
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,320
Yes,

188
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,200
I was in such a hurry

189
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,450
to see you quickly.

190
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,910
I didn't expect the trail to be so steep.

191
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,240
Hang in there.

192
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,550
Boss.

193
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,870
We've got something.

194
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,630
Go on.

195
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,480
Take a look.

196
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,080
This is...

197
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,760
A photo of the suspected perpetrator.

198
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,120
This...

199
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,960
This is...

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,580
You think it's too blurry?

201
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
Don't complain about the blurriness.

202
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,030
This is

203
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,200
taken from the dashcam

204
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,670
of the truck that passed by.

205
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,720
It's the only frontal shot we have.

206
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,040
You've worked hard.

207
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
It's just my fate.

208
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,030
Ms. Ma.

209
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,910
Ms. Ma.

210
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,490
Alright.

211
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,670
Make sure the police secure the scene.

212
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,270
Send me the location. I'll be there right away.

213
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,220
What happened?

214
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,960
She Shiyuan fell off a cliff at Jianyu Mountain.

215
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,750
The police have already cordoned off the scene.

216
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,870
The case has been transferred to Division Three.

217
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
I need to go there.

218
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,480
Wait.

219
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll go with you.

220
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,550
Division Director Yang.

221
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,630
Mentor.

222
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,120
Division Director Yang, you've been discharged from the hospital?

223
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,380
What's the situation?

224
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,890
The police received a report at 5:05 p.m.

225
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
The local police station immediately

226
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,260
sealed off the entire mountain area.

227
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,120
From receiving the report to sealing off the mountain,

228
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,250
how long did it take?

229
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,670
About

230
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,800
20 minutes or so.

231
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,120
How many exits are there from the mountain?

232
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
There's only one road down the mountain.

233
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,000
The exit surveillance footage shows

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,270
from the time of the incident until now,

235
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,910
no one has been seen coming down the mountain.

236
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,000
We have also conducted

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,390
the whole mountain area.

238
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,150
The four people, including the injured,

239
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,200
should be the only group of hikers

240
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
during this time period.

241
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,370
Have you checked

242
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,790
the entire mountain situation?

243
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,960
The peak of Jianyu Mountain,

244
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,390
also known as Eagle's Backward Flight,

245
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,390
is very dangerous.

246
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,200
Every year, several hiking enthusiasts

247
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,530
get injured or die here.

248
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,000
What about the injured person?

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,630
The injured person has already been transferred.

250
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,000
Those two are bodyguards.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,530
Where's the fourth person?

252
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,200
The person who reported the incident is in the car.

253
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,400
Zhang Lei will question her in a moment.

254
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,190
Division Director Yang.

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,730
You know her.

256
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,720
Who?

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,730
Zhao Yaning.

258
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,210
Tan Yaoduo,

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,600
take a team

260
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,200
to the first scene at the mountain top.

261
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,930
Understood.

262
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,120
You go to the second scene

263
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,120
and see if Liu Weijian

264
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,580
has made any discoveries.

265
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,330
Tian Ziwei,

266
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,970
you and Section Chief Chen

267
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
use night vision drones

268
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
to carefully scan the entire mountain

269
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
and see if you can find anything.

270
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,630
Alright.

271
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,230
Thank you for your hard work.

272
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,840
Hello.

273
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,650
Let me reintroduce myself.

274
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,020
I'm Yang Guang from the Yanping State Security Bureau.

275
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,180
I couldn't tell you before

276
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,970
because we have our protocols.

277
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,800
Please understand.

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,320
What happened today

279
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,970
is something none of us wanted to see.

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,550
I hope you can tell us

281
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,490
everything you know truthfully.

282
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,790
Today,

283
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,260
the president of Moss Trading Group,

284
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,080
Mr. Sander Bowie,

285
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
called me.

286
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,910
He wanted me to persuade

287
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,960
Mr. She Shiyuan

288
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,330
to reconsider cooperating with them.

289
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,550
So I called Mr. She,

290
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,440
and he told me

291
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
he was on his way to Jianyu Mountain.

292
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,270
Then,

293
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,340
I immediately set out to find him.

294
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Based on the location he gave me,

295
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,330
after meeting up with him,

296
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,840
in order to persuade him,

297
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,330
I accompanied him on the hike.

298
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,840
How did the persuasion go?

299
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Before we even got to the main topic,

300
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,630
he told me with certainty

301
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,770
that he had already decided

302
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,500
not to cooperate with Sander.

303
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,500
Such a simple decision

304
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,810
could have been explained over the phone.

305
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Why did he wait until you came all the way here

306
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,080
to tell you?

307
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,240
He said it was precisely because I came after him

308
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,720
that he felt my sincerity.

309
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,030
He didn't want to beat around the bush with me anymore,

310
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,360
so he told me directly.

311
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,030
I see.

312
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,790
Then why did you

313
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,840
stop halfway?

314
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,320
Why didn't you climb to the top with him?

315
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,180
I really couldn't go any further.

316
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,870
Ms. Zhao, let's take a break.

317
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,510
Okay.

318
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,160
Ms. Zhao,

319
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,510
you can't climb any further.

320
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,109
I'll send someone to escort you down the mountain right away.

321
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,440
It's fine. I can manage.

322
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,040
Ms. Zhao's perseverance

323
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,750
is truly admirable.

324
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,240
This time, I'll reach the summit first.

325
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,720
When we're done, let's have a meal together.

326
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,069
It's my treat.

327
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,170
Alright.

328
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,680
You two stay here and protect Ms. Zhao.

329
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,310
These two will stay here to protect you.

330
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,310
It's okay.

331
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,720
How could I leave Ms. Zhao alone

332
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,510
here?

333
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,530
Okay.

334
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,380
Wait for me.

335
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,490
What happened after that?

336
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,850
It's already been 10 minutes. Why hasn't Mr. She come back?

337
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,720
Mr. She often climbs this mountain.

338
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,440
He should be back in 10 minutes normally.

339
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,000
I think he's on his way back.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,060
I'll go check what it's going on. You stay with Ms. Zhao.

341
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,880
Ms. Zhao,

342
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,110
please sit here for a moment.

343
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,440
I'll go look for Mr. She.

344
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,060
I'll come with you.

345
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,170
Watch your step.

346
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,960
Mr. She!

347
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,480
Mr. She!

348
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,640
Mr. She!

349
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,480
Mr. She!

350
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,240
Mr. She!

351
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,200
Mr. She!

352
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,400
Mr. She!

353
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,270
Mr. She!

354
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,200
Mr. She!

355
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,640
Mr. She!

356
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,750
Do you hear me?

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,750
Mr. She!

358
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,030
Mr. She!

359
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,640
Do you think the distance between this position and the cliff

360
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,370
is far or not?

361
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,480
Given this height,

362
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,590
to fall this far

363
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,350
indeed defies the laws of physics.

364
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,510
Are there any signs of struggle on the victim?

365
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,680
The forensic expert has examined

366
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,280
and said they found nothing.

367
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,240
Tan, Tan,

368
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,920
how's the situation at the summit?

369
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,400
Mentor,

370
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,350
there are signs of slipping on the side where the victim fell.

371
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,310
There are footprints from four pairs of shoes on the ground,

372
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,880
which roughly match the height and build of the victim

373
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
and the three witnesses.

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,830
No traces of anyone else were found.

375
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,440
You,

376
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,240
take some videos.

377
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,640
Make sure they're clear.

378
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,400
Capture everything around, okay?

379
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,130
Understood.

380
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,770
Come on.

381
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,720
Tian,

382
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,250
how's the drone situation?

383
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
We have now

384
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
thoroughly searched the cliffs on both sides

385
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,880
of the summit where the incident occurred.

386
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,920
So far, we haven't found any obvious signs

387
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,030
of ropes or climbing pitons being used.

388
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,230
I see. Keep at it then.

389
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,450
Alright.

390
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Hello, Director Zhang.

391
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,400
How's the investigation going?

392
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,200
It's ongoing.

393
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,000
Just now, Capital City Energy Company

394
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,310
elected a new representative.

395
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,000
Sun Daren.

396
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,790
He has notified Huaze Group

397
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,480
to suspend the nuclear power negotiations.

398
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,810
He suspects that She Shiyuan's cliff fall

399
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,240
is related to the current negotiations with the Chinese side.

400
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,830
Isn't this pure nonsense?

401
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,590
What evidence do they have?

402
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,650
Don't mind others.

403
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,920
But you

404
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,450
must give me an accurate answer

405
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,200
within 24 hours.

406
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,480
This matter has a significant impact.

407
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,210
Understood.

408
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,250
Ms. Zhao,

409
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,310
Sun Daren,

410
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,890
do you know him?

411
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,680
How did you two meet?

412
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,750
What kind of person is he?

413
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,840
Can you tell me about him?

414
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,110
I met him at

415
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,690
Leader Group's headquarters.

416
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,030
I remember

417
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,400
he served as a supervisor at Guangyu Bank.

418
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,270
That's all I know.

419
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,710
Thank you.

420
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,210
This information is very important to us.

421
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,860
May I leave now?

422
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,730
Yes, you may.

423
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,960
Please escort Ms. Zhao home.

424
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,490
Alright.

425
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,280
Let's add each other on WeChat.

426
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,970
Director Zhang called.

427
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,510
24 hours

428
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,160
to get a clear response.

429
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,690
Now, centered on the crime scene,

430
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,270
conduct a thorough search.

431
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,030
Pay special attention to the woods in flat areas

432
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,920
and places that could serve as hiding spots.

433
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,520
Remember,

434
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,000
no one is allowed to act alone.

435
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,130
Let's stay in touch.

436
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,450
Let's go.

437
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,660
Let's move.

438
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,640
Be careful.

439
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,520
Don't worry.

440
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,160
Tan,

441
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,250
take a look.

442
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,350
So many broken branches.

443
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,080
What was this covering?

444
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,550
There's a smell of engine oil.

445
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,790
Four-stroke engine oil.

446
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,110
Motorcycle oil, right?

447
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,480
Yes.

448
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,830
I used to be into vehicles, you know.

449
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,200
So I have some knowledge about this.

450
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,680
This should be

451
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,830
SC grade oil.

452
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,400
It's widely used.

453
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,250
Almost all brands produce it.

454
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,750
And it should be from

455
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,160
an off-road motorcycle.

456
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,960
Not too big,

457
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,480
probably around 125cc.

458
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,350
Tan,

459
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,200
contact the traffic management department.

460
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,590
Carefully check all surveillance footage half an hour before and after the mountain was closed.

461
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,320
Understood.

462
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,070
Good evening, Mr. Bowie.

463
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,350
Ms. Zhao.

464
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,510
I'm not well at all.

465
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,110
I'm very upset.

466
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,640
You've heard about Mr. She?

467
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,720
Yes, I have.

468
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,640
Now

469
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,130
I'm still in shock.

470
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,310
Yes.

471
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,200
It's too sudden.

472
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Yes.

473
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,280
Very sudden.

474
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,720
I want to ask you.

475
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,470
You have nothing to do with this, right?

476
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,230
How is that possible?

477
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,270
As you said,

478
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,830
whether the cooperation works out or not,

479
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,110
we're all friends, right?

480
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,600
Right.

481
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,960
I might be too confused right now.

483
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,290
I'm talking nonsense. Please don't mind.

484
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,240
I understand.

485
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Get some rest.

486
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,270
Calm down a bit.

487
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,000
This matter

488
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,510
is really upsetting.

489
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,710
By the way.

490
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,240
Tomorrow...

491
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,960
Never mind.

492
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,170
You'd better

493
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,270
get some rest.

494
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,530
It's okay. Go ahead.

495
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,940
Tomorrow morning.

496
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,590
At 10 o'clock.

497
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,350
We and

498
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,630
Capital City Energy Company

499
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,160
will restart

500
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,970
nuclear power negotiations.

501
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,530
It's alright. I'll be there tomorrow.

502
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,350
I must go.

503
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,720
Mr. Bowie,

504
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,320
doing our best at work now

505
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,010
is the greatest wish we can offer Mr. She.

506
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,550
Right?

507
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,030
Well said.

508
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,500
See you tomorrow then.

509
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,400
Okay.

510
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,590
At five o'clock this morning,

511
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,960
the police received a report.

512
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,350
It was discovered by a passerby.

513
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,680
They said it was an abandoned factory area.

514
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,940
There was a small fire.

515
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,550
After the firefighters arrived,

516
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,550
they found this burned motorcycle.

517
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,830
The characteristics of this vehicle

518
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,750
completely match

519
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,510
the clues we found in the mountains.

520
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,790
It can basically be identified as the same.

521
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,440
Have you checked the surrounding surveillance?

522
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,590
This abandoned factory area has been out of use for a long time.

523
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,480
There are no surveillance cameras or staff.

524
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,920
And it's in a remote location.

525
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,790
So we didn't get

526
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,310
any valid images of the suspect.

527
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,110
It's obvious.

528
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,410
The culprit had a meticulous plan.

529
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,410
From the attack

530
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,500
to the retreat,

531
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,610
it can be said to be almost perfect.

532
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,010
This is clearly murder.

533
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
This morning,

534
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
Capital City Energy Company representative Sun Daren

535
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
will restart nuclear power negotiations

536
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
with Moss Trading Group.

537
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
She Shiyuan just fell off the cliff.

538
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,750
The project Sander Bowie lost has come back.

539
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,960
You stay here to handle this.

540
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,690
Let's go to Moss Trading Group.

541
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,510
Ms. Zhao.

542
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,110
Mr. Bowie.

543
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,400
Mr. Sun.

544
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,240
Long time no see, Miss Zhao.

545
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,310
Long time no see, Mr. Sun. It's been a while.

546
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,240
Long time no see.

547
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,830
You haven't changed a bit. Still the same as ever.

548
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,430
Is that so?

549
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,000
You've become even more beautiful.

550
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,830
Thank you.

551
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,510
We're all old friends here.

552
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,640
Please, have a seat.

553
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,640
After you, Mr. Sun.

554
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,000
Alright, please, Ms. Zhao.

555
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
Just now, Mr. Sun

556
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,990
specifically mentioned

557
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,000
that you are old friends.

558
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,170
Yes, that's right.

559
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,310
Now, Mr. Sun is the new

560
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,510
negotiation representative for the Capital City Energy Company.

561
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,110
What a coincidence, Mr. Sun.

562
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,480
Back when Mr. Sun and his wife

563
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,880
were studying abroad,

564
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,400
I was responsible for some of the reception at the Leader headquarters.

565
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,640
It was during that time

566
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
that I became good friends

567
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,560
with Mr. Sun and his wife.

568
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,000
How is Huiqi doing?

569
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,350
She's doing well.

570
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,160
She often mentions you too.

571
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,740
She says that during her time abroad,

572
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
it was thanks to you

573
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,580
that she didn't feel so bored.

574
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,810
I miss her very much.

575
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Regarding Mr. She's incident yesterday,

576
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,400
we feel very sorry.

577
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,890
Yes, indeed.

578
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,070
Even now,

579
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
I still can't believe

580
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,400
everything that happened yesterday.

581
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,440
I believe

582
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,790
there will be a day when the truth comes to light.

583
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,270
Heaven will surely give

584
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,110
Mr. She the justice he deserves.

585
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,270
The hospital has reported

586
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
that his condition is still stable.

587
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,720
However,

588
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,970
there's basically no chance of him regaining consciousness.

589
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,510
We will arrange for him to get treatment

590
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,680
in Yanping for a while.

591
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,920
If there's no improvement,

592
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,440
we'll transfer him back to our country

593
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,770
for further treatment and recuperation.

594
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,810
Let's hope everything goes smoothly.

595
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,000
Therefore,

596
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,350
we need to keep our spirits up even more

597
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,510
and have a good discussion about our future cooperation.

598
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,310
So that Mr. She can rest assured,

599
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,240
and to put my superiors

600
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,480
and Ms. Zhao

601
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,310
and Mr. Bowie at ease.

602
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,790
Thank you very much.

603
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Our negotiations

604
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,350
were previously suspended for various reasons

605
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,640
for several days.

606
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,640
But Mr. Bowie has promised

607
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,310
that they are fully prepared with

608
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,240
the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology

609
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,920
demo

610
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,720
and technical documentation.

611
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,770
They can meet our previous requirements

612
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,480
for all pre-contract testing and observation.

613
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
So I've decided

614
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,350
to restart our cooperation.

615
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,510
Good.

616
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,880
Thank you very much indeed.

617
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,110
Please tell Huiqi

618
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,440
on behalf of me

619
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,440
that she's very welcome to visit Yanping.

620
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,310
I'll definitely show her around

621
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,170
when she comes.

622
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,960
Sure, sure.

623
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,550
You're also welcome

624
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,140
to visit Capital City when you have time.

625
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,840
Goodbye.

626
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,410
Goodbye.

627
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,830
Mr. Sun, we will do our best.

628
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,590
Two hours.

629
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,640
Seems like the negotiation went well.

630
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,960
Mr. Yang, you should be nearby, right?

631
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,310
If it's convenient, let's meet.

632
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,120
What's going on?

633
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,210
How does she know we're nearby?

634
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,480
Ms. Zhao,

635
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,889
no problem.

636
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,840
In half an hour?

637
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,760
I'll send you the address later.

638
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,889
Are we really going?

639
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,380
Today, Moss Trading Group

640
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
restarted negotiations with Capital City Energy Company.

641
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,570
She told me about it.

642
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,960
The content of their meeting

643
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,159
is only known to her.

644
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,920
You know, Zhang Wuji's mother

645
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,840
told Zhang Wuji

646
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,800
that the more beautiful a woman is, the more she lies.

647
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
What's Zhang Wuji's mother's name?

648
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,710
Miao Cuihua.

649
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,760
You don't even know his mother's name,

650
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,219
so don't lecture me with his mother's words.

651
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,110
That sounds like an insult.

652
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,679
Let's go.

653
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm just worried your lifelong reputation might be ruined in an instant.

654
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,620
Then you go.

655
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,550
Drive.

656
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,350
Just go ahead and ruin yourself.

657
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,920
Ms. Zhao, you called to meet me.

658
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,330
What advice do you have?

659
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,590
To be honest,

660
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,480
I regret it a bit.

661
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,770
You regret meeting me so soon?

662
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,830
This goes against my principles as a PR person.

663
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,630
But I hope

664
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,800
that Mr. She's matter

665
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,230
can come to light soon.

666
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,840
So,

667
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,360
I hope everything I tell you today

668
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,920
is for your reference and judgment only.

669
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,870
I don't want anyone else to know.

670
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,930
Go ahead.

671
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,510
Today's meeting

672
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,910
went so smoothly that it felt a bit strange.

673
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,670
Many principle issues

674
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,670
seemed to have been tacitly agreed upon.

675
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,330
Both sides made concessions.

676
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
And some cooperation details I cared about

677
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
didn't seem to be issues in their eyes.

678
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,340
So, has Moss Trading Group

679
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,480
really mastered

680
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology?

681
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,080
I don't think it's possible.

682
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,510
At least before Mr. She's incident,

683
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,070
it couldn't be fully proven.

684
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,270
What about Sun Daren?

685
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,990
Didn't he have any doubts today?

686
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,320
He should be clear about the previous situation.

687
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
He indeed didn't raise any doubts.

688
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
After Sander proposed to provide technical materials

689
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,920
and a demo,

690
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,070
he agreed.

691
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,220
It doesn't make sense.

692
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,550
So,

693
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,240
that's why I came to see you.

694
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,320
Ms. Zhao, you came here specifically today

695
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,650
to tell me these things.

696
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,930
It was actually beyond my expectations,

697
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,400
different from your previous image.

698
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,510
I'm a PR person.

699
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,340
I hope to gain benefits from this.

700
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,230
But I also hope

701
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,650
everything can be clear and transparent.

702
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,630
Mr. She's incident

703
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,920
indeed shocked me.

704
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,930
Business is business,

705
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,770
why would someone lose their life in this?

706
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,450
This is beyond my understanding.

707
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,740
Thank you for telling me all this.

708
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,760
Hello.

709
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,290
Brother.

710
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Hey, brother.

711
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,710
I'm Li Jian.

712
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,480
If you have anything to say,

713
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,340
say it quickly.

714
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,880
You have three minutes.

715
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,210
I'm on a tight schedule.

716
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,400
My friend,

717
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,150
one minute is enough.

718
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,480
I just want to ask you,

719
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,820
do you know Sun Daren from Capital City Energy Company?

720
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,590
I've heard of Sun Daren,

721
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,710
but I've never met him.

722
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,000
Then, does he have any close relationship

723
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,510
with Sander Bowie?

724
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,730
I don't know about that.

725
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,030
I really don't know. Buddy.

726
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,320
Don't forget,

727
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,190
we have a deal,

728
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,070
right?

729
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,630
Yes,

730
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,590
I know.

731
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,760
Well then...

732
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,100
I just remembered something.

733
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,120
Keep this a secret for me, buddy.

734
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,280
This Sun,

735
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,230
during his time working at the Guangyu Bank branch,

736
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,880
was involved in quite a few illegal money transfers.

737
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
The amount was enormous.

738
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,930
If it weren't for Sander Bowie's help,

739
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,960
he would have been arrested long ago.

740
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,710
That's what makes you a true friend.

741
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,970
Have you seen the news?

742
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,150
What's the connection between this Sun Daren

743
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,440
and She Shiyuan who was involved in the incident?

744
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,550
I don't know about that.

745
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,550
Buddy, I'm really pressed for time.

746
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,480
The time we agreed on

747
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,920
is up.

748
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,800
I really consider you a friend,

749
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
that's why I told you all this.

750
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,670
You know that?

751
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,840
Let's try our best

752
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,440
not to contact each other anymore, okay?

753
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,960
Alright, buddy.

754
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,280
Got some major findings. See you at the division.

755
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,070
I also have a major discovery.

756
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,400
See you at the division.

757
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,900
Zhao Yaning revealed to me

758
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,000
that today's meeting

759
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,960
went smoothly.

760
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,120
On many principled issues,

761
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,360
the two seemed to be in tacit agreement,

762
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,280
each making concessions.

763
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,210
This matches up.

764
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,030
Sun Daren and Sander are definitely involved

765
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,710
in some shady business here.

766
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,100
Division Director Yang, I have a new discovery.

767
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,230
Based on the intelligence provided by Li Minhao,

768
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,880
I found a

769
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,440
an app

770
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,640
called Entity Watch.

771
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,920
This software can access information

772
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,360
on all individuals registered with companies

773
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,620
in the Nanmen Islands.

774
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,150
Through cross-referencing,

775
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,210
I found Sun Daren's private account.

776
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,550
This account belongs to

777
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,550
Nanmen Islands OS Finance Company.

778
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,510
which specializes in handling illegal black money.

779
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,400
Can the specific transaction records

780
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
be retrieved?

781
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,030
The transaction records have been hidden,

782
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,030
but I discovered an email address

783
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,030
in his account.

784
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,320
This email is different from

785
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,420
the two work emails he publicly uses.

786
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,670
I found a document

787
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,880
in the email.

788
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,440
The document is in English.

789
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,370
I translated it,

790
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,320
and it says,

791
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,670
"Basic terms for the proposal and negotiation

792
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,480
of nuclear power cooperation with Moss Trading Group."

793
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,320
The receiving time

794
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
was 1:32 PM yesterday.

795
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
1:32 PM yesterday?

796
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,840
She Shiyuan hadn't fallen off the cliff yet,

797
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,360
but Sun Daren had already received the contract

798
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,400
through his secret email.

799
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
This proves he knew in advance

800
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,280
that something would happen to She Shiyuan.

801
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,140
This is definitely a conspiracy.

802
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,110
Good morning,

803
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,440
old friend.

804
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,800
There's been a change in the situation.

805
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,460
At nine o'clock this morning,

806
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,840
Huaze Group

807
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,670
directly contacted the chairman

808
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,190
of our company.

809
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,010
They hope to conduct

810
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,320
an open

811
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,630
technology competition

812
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,760
and demonstration with your group.

813
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,110
They will also implement

814
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,480
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology.

815
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,840
The Chinese side promises

816
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,150
that if their technology

817
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,010
is more stable,

818
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,550
they are willing to completely give up

819
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,010
the previously requested

820
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,800
30% equity,

821
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,320
retaining only 10% equity

822
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,360
and providing free

823
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,270
maintenance services for the next five years.

824
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,110
If the Chinese technology loses,

825
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,890
the Chinese side is willing to withdraw.

826
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,800
With such lenient conditions?

827
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,970
The Chinese side indicates

828
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,110
that this is their

829
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,190
long-term plan.

830
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,710
In the future, they will continue to cooperate

831
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,760
with our company in this mode.

832
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,760
Therefore,

833
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,440
the Chinese proposal

834
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,290
is impossible for our company to refuse.

835
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,030
When is the technology competition

836
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,210
and demonstration scheduled?

837
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,320
May 30th.

838
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,800
Both parties will prepare

839
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,590
technical data

840
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,920
and operational demos.

841
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,150
It's said

842
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,510
that the Chinese side will use Sun Yaokuan's

843
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,360
original computer data.

844
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,400
So you need to work hard.

845
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,550
We won't lose.

846
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,840
Wait for my news.

847
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,880
A technology show then?

848
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Sun Yaokuan's laptop will be reactivated.

849
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,480
And this may be our last chance.

850
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,740
What do you need me for?

851
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,710
No.

852
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,970
Nothing you need to do.

853
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,430
We'll let the Whale do his thing first.

854
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,690
Will he be able to do it?

855
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,480
Well,

856
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,280
I've been preparing for this

857
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,280
for a very long time.

858
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,150
Sun Yaokuan,

859
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,440
as responsible for Chinese Gen-4

860
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,880
nuclear technology.

861
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,110
Over the years, he's led the R&D force

862
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,960
of No. 2 Nuclear Research Team.
