[Episode 11]

3
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,720
This is China's territory.

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,490
I have the right to enforce the law.

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,430
Stop the ship!

6
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,009
Okay.

7
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,090
Get to the shore!

8
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,770
Okay.

9
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,730
This is my last warning.

10
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,250
Stop the ship!

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Okay.

12
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,730
Yang Guang!

13
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,790
Are you okay?

14
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,950
You get out of here.

15
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,820
I'll handle him.

16
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,500
Don't move.

17
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,730
Don't move.

18
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,870
Pull him up.

19
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,520
Handcuff him.

20
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:47,960
Good.

21
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,650
-Don't move.
-Don't move.

22
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,159
Don't move.

23
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,750
Don't move. Get up.

24
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,409
Don't move.

25
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,450
Behave yourself.

26
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,460
Come on.

27
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,190
Get up.

28
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,720
Hello, Mr. Luca.

29
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,770
Long time no see.

30
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,810
Ms. Zhao.

31
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,490
What a coincidence.

32
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,710
What are you doing here?

33
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,910
Can we talk in the car?

34
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,330
Alright.

35
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,549
I'm here to pick you up.

36
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,260
Rumor has it that Hermes in China

37
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,720
has four people in charge.

38
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,360
CEO Sander Bowie,

39
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,060
intelligence chief Duke,

40
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,230
external liaison leader Sherry.

41
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,480
If I'm not mistaken,

42
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,200
Mr. Luca,

43
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,920
you should be the fourth person lurking in the shadows,

44
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
Hermes' top assassin.

45
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,370
Who are you?

46
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,890
I'm Zhao Yaning from Leader Group.

47
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,090
We know each other.

48
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,110
I seem to know the former Ms. Zhao,

49
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,230
but I don't know the current Ms. Zhao.

50
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,820
Whether it's in the past or now,

51
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,280
I am always your friend.

52
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,720
But I really don't know what you're talking about.

53
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,450
Sorry.

54
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,620
Then let me make the situation clearer.

55
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,080
You remotely copied and stole

56
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,650
Sun Yaokuan's

57
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,920
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology documents,

58
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,280
along with the intelligence

59
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,810
Hermes has collected in China over the years.

60
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,510
It should be somewhere in this car, right?

61
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,130
Who exactly are you?

62
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,370
I'm from Leader.

63
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,840
Let me put it this way.

64
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,300
Your Hermes,

65
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,000
compared to our big boss,

66
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,680
is not even in the same league.

67
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,210
Given your current situation,

68
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,800
if you want to get out unscathed

69
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,130
and safely leave China,

70
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,680
cooperating with me

71
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,280
is your only way out.

72
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,240
J,

73
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,430
Mr. Luca has arrived.

74
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,990
Mr. Luca,

75
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,360
nice to meet you.

76
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,600
My name is James.

77
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Friends call me J.

78
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,720
I heard you really wanted to see me.

79
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,840
What do you want to say?

80
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,880
Don't worry,

81
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,840
the national security personnel

82
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,100
won't find this place.

83
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,520
Let's go inside and have a good talk.

84
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,310
We have plenty of time.

85
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:05,870
Please.

86
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,370
Who are you people, really?

87
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,930
Hermes is just a rootless tree.

88
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,810
While we have the backing of a giant tree.

89
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,060
A towering tree that covers the globe.

90
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,390
Are you the CIA?

91
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,090
We are not the CIA.

92
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,720
We only serve our big boss.

93
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,150
Who is your big boss?

94
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,690
You should ask

95
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,030
what our big boss is.

96
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,330
What can trigger wars,

97
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,140
control the lifelines of nations?

98
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,270
It's money.

99
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,020
It's capital.

100
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,010
It doesn't belong to anyone,

101
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,570
but everyone serves it.

102
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,910
Its power never disappears,

103
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,070
and it grows stronger and stronger,

104
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,910
powerful enough to control the entire world.

105
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,710
Then I want to know,

106
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,230
why do you want to get involved in

107
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,070
this nuclear power technology matter?

108
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,000
Because we want to obtain it too.

109
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,670
It's the future of the world.

110
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,070
Actually, Leader and Hermes

111
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
have always had a good cooperation.

112
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,670
In the Jiangcheng incident,

113
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,540
the intelligence on the multinational conference

114
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,600
was provided by me.

115
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,530
The representative of Capital City Energy Company,

116
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,990
She Shiyuan's personal information

117
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,850
was given by me.

118
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,290
Sander Bowie's

119
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,170
first meeting with She Shiyuan

120
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,250
was arranged by me.

121
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,400
So you see,

122
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,830
we are not enemies,

123
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,690
we are friends.

124
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,000
It's just that

125
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,880
we are hidden behind you.

126
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,480
Unlike Hermes,

127
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,670
we're not

128
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,400
after quick success and instant benefits.

129
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,730
The reason we have become an organization

130
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,070
with decades of history,

131
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,430
involved in many major regional events,

132
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,190
is because our goals

133
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,200
are very ambitious.

134
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,910
So ambitious that you even want to steal

135
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,410
an incomplete 4th-generation technology?

136
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,430
We're all the same in this regard.

137
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,040
To be honest,

138
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,820
the information and intelligence you possess,

139
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,970
of course I want it.

140
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,040
But what I value more

141
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,550
is you, Mr. Luca.

142
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,160
The 2016 Bello Airport heart patient case,

143
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,910
the 2018

144
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,850
bizarre car accident of the West African trader,

145
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
the 2020

146
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,950
electrocution death of the Dongchuan Power Plant technician,

147
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,950
we've been analyzing and studying these cases,

148
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,760
trying to figure out who

149
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,920
has such outstanding operational capabilities.

150
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,190
During this operation,

151
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,950
Zhao and I

152
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,600
discovered you.

153
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,520
Your writer identity is truly flawless.

154
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,810
Until headquarters sent a special piece of intelligence,

155
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,590
Zhao and I confirmed

156
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,120
that you were the assassin.

157
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,880
I don't like being investigated.

158
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,160
It's not an investigation,

159
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,090
it's gaining more understanding.

160
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,520
Now,

161
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,430
I not only want

162
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,960
the hard drive and intelligence in your possession,

163
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,610
but I also want to become

164
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,000
true friends with you.

165
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
Three high-performance sedans ready to go at any time,

166
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,170
equipped with ten registered spare license plates.

167
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,120
Keys to a safe house with six months'

168
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,950
worth of stored food and drinking water.

169
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,550
Also, six passports from countries

170
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,010
that have no extradition treaty with China.

171
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,430
Three encrypted phones.

172
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,000
One untraceable satellite phone.

173
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,310
And a card.

174
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,270
This card is linked to a foreign account.

175
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,350
It can't be traced.

176
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,210
It contains 500,000 dollars.

177
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,830
What does all this mean?

178
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,760
Mr. Luca, you're a smart man.

179
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,400
This is our gesture of goodwill to make friends with smart people.

180
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,000
Of course,

181
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,480
you could also kill us

182
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,570
and keep befriending Sander Bowie,

183
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,310
who will never leave prison.

184
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,950
If you do that,

185
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,640
you'll become an enemy of both the Chinese Ministry of State Security

186
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,310
and our organization.

187
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,620
The experience

188
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
won't be pleasant.

189
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,670
Mr. Luca,

190
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,070
these two men are looking for you.

191
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
These two

192
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,520
are most likely from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

193
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,880
How did you get this photo?

194
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,700
This is Leader's capability.

195
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,830
They are from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

196
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,790
I know.

197
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,950
Yang Guang, Deputy Division Director of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

198
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,240
Li Jian, Head of the Operations Section of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

199
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,370
You're being tracked by these two men.

200
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,520
It will be very difficult for you to escape.

201
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,310
Mr. Luca,

202
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
you can go.

203
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,520
But where can you go?

204
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,310
Sander Bowie,

205
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,730
who grew up with you in the orphanage.

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
He's much older than you.

207
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,790
He was your best big brother

208
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,640
and childhood playmate.

209
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,000
He promised you

210
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,520
to take you to higher peaks,

211
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,240
but he himself never reached them.

212
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,480
And you,

213
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,280
you've always been cleaning up his messes and doing his dirty work.

214
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,390
What you've gained

215
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,790
is far less than what you've given,

216
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:17,880
isn't it?

217
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,069
So what?

218
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,960
Hermes is gone.

219
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,069
How long can you maintain

220
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,880
that writer identity of yours?

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,240
Do you want to go back to the orphanage?

222
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,240
Back to that small town,

223
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,320
to spend the rest of your life in obscurity?

224
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,720
Besides us,

225
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,630
who else knows about

226
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,550
your achievements as a top spy?

227
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,760
What exactly are you trying to say?

228
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That depends on what you want.

229
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,550
What Leader can offer you

230
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,720
is far more than Hermes ever could.

231
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,630
Money

232
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,200
is the easiest thing.

233
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,880
Besides these 500,000,

234
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,960
you'll have

235
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,830
a private account in a Zurich bank.

236
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
There will be 3 million US dollars

237
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,990
and 3 million euros in it,

238
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,630
enough for you to live comfortably anywhere in the world

239
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,150
for the rest of your life.

240
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,760
As to your identity,

241
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,760
writer,

242
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
bank manager,

243
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,250
investor...

244
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,790
We can

245
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,920
arrange any kind flawlessly.

246
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm an assassin.

247
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,630
It's only natural to work for money.

248
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,780
But I don't want to be caught by Chinese State Security.

249
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,710
If you want me to join you,

250
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,520
you must provide me with sufficient guarantees.

251
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,030
8 million US dollars,

252
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,350
a complete set of American identity and passport.

253
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,630
I knew I wasn't wrong about you,

254
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,440
Mr. Luca.

255
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,550
I'm retiring next year.

256
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,240
I believe you have the ability to take my place

257
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,480
and become Leader's head in China.

258
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,110
Mr. Luca,

259
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,070
a higher peak

260
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,440
is right in front of you.

261
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I believe you can reach it.

262
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,500
I've always enjoyed mountain climbing,

263
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,070
but if this mountain blocks my path,

264
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,110
I have ways to make it disappear.

265
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,070
Okay.

266
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,960
It's been a pleasure working with you.

267
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,070
Do you think he's trustworthy?

268
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,310
Whether he's trustworthy depends on you.

269
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,890
Does my opinion matter?

270
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,040
Are you angry?

271
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,630
Is it because I said he could take over for me?

272
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,830
You should know I said that on purpose.

273
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,280
I know.

274
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,440
And I don't think you're that petty.

275
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,640
You know me well.

276
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,200
Of course.

277
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,680
I know you better than anyone.

278
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,650
My judgment has always been accurate.

279
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,930
It won't be wrong.

280
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,990
But I must warn you.

281
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
He's an assassin.

282
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,820
His principles are completely different from ours.

283
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,250
For us,

284
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,290
he's just a gun.

285
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,830
Yes.

286
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,070
But for the plan we're about to start,

287
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,690
we need him for many things.

288
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,720
The State Security is trying everything to find him now.

289
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,680
Those demands he made,

290
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,580
will you really agree to them?

291
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,490
He's a professional assassin.

292
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,200
What an assassin wants

293
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,310
is either a job or money.

294
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,760
You don't need to worry about this.

295
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,440
Moreover, now he

296
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,220
has nowhere else to go.

297
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,050
He can only cooperate with us.

298
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
When necessary,

299
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,920
a gun can kill,

300
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,600
or be discarded.

301
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
Another "big fish lurking behind" moment.

302
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,060
This time, we've set out another big bait.

303
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,110
This is for our safety.

304
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,450
Alright.

305
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,550
Go arrange the data transfer.

306
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,070
Make sure the information on the hard drive

307
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,960
is safely transmitted to the headquarters,

308
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,310
to our technical team.

309
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,050
Okay.

310
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,310
Then I'll head back to Yanping first.

311
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,150
During this period of Hermes' downfall,

312
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,680
there will be many changes.

313
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,740
We need to keep an eye on these changes

314
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,680
to ensure we're still in the game.

315
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,150
This is crucial for our subsequent plans.

316
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,070
What are the subsequent plans?

317
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,270
You haven't discussed them with me yet.

318
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,390
I'll tell you when the time comes.

319
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,840
Alright.

320
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,420
Then I'll head back first.

321
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,240
Boss,

322
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,440
I've got the stuff

323
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,680
from Hermes.

324
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,000
Good.

325
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,520
Make sure it's secure.

326
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,550
Okay, I know.

327
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,740
I'll have someone send it over.

328
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,850
The next step is ready,

329
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,710
but Ministry of State Security of China

330
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,410
is very vigilant now.

331
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,440
So,

332
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,600
we need to wait for the right moment to proceed.

333
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,900
Time is everything. Stay alert.

334
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
Okay, I got it.

335
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,290
[Lian Hai City National Safety Bureau]

336
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,240
Have you figured out what to say?

337
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,670
How is

338
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,440
Rick?

339
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,010
He won't die.

340
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,990
He's in the hospital.

341
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,990
Your silence here means nothing.

342
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,370
The training you've received,

343
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,640
the techniques you know,

344
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,750
all the contingency measures in your mind,

345
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,720
here,

346
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,390

the other circumstances.

349

I just want you to tell me

350
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,250
who sent you the message

351
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,330
that made you decide to change flights in Moscow.

352
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,680
Who prepared

353
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,960
the getaway vehicles along the route for you?

354
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,720
And who

355
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,040
took away the technical data

356
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,720
you obtained through remote copying?

357

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,590

361
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,550
I don't like it.

362
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
The vehicle

363
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,120
has been prepared long ago.

364

The documents

365
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,590
have been destroyed.

366
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
I wouldn't

367
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,150

368
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,240
incriminating documents on me.

369
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,640
That person from Tianli Manor villa was there too, right?

370
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
That was where you

371
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,760
handed over the technical documents to him.

372
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,310
Am I right?

373

Room 3302 of Liangma Apartments.

380
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,630
A listening device was found inside a fridge magnet,

381
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,560
but the owner couldn't be identified.

382
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,010
Inside the Moss Trading Group,

383
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,050
no clues of any escapees were found.

384
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,590
At Tianli Manor villa,

385
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,200
32 fingerprints were collected.

386
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,990
After comparison,

387
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,060
they were found to belong to the regular cleaning staff.

388
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,300
The scene must have been cleaned up.

389
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,340
Section Chief Chen and I

390
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,320
recovered the contents of Sander Bowie's phone.

391
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,830
In the call logs and text messages, we found that

392
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,790
after Sander Bowie boarded in Zurich,

393
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,440
a number called his phone

394
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,840
but didn't get through.

395
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,870
So this number

396
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,980
left a message

397
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,690
for Sander Bowie via text.

398
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,240
Sander's flight change in Russia

399
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,070
and his escape route after landing

400
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,000
were all sent

401
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,860
by this number via text messages.

402
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,500
Have you found the owner of the number?

403
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,230
Yes, we have.

404
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,060
The registered owner is a construction worker.

405
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,750
Two years ago, while working in Yanping,

406
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,070
he sold the number to a phone number dealer.

407
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,530
But as to who the final user of this number is,

408
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,310
too many people have handled it.

409
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,310
We haven't been able to trace it yet.

410
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,740
Based on the clues we've gathered so far,

411
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,500
we can make the following deduction:

412
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,040
The person from Liangma Apartments Room 3302,

413
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,920
the one who slipped through our net,

414
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
learned through the wiretap

415
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,820
that their operation had been exposed.

416
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,030
So he immediately called Sander Bowie,

417
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,910
hoping to stop him from boarding the plane.

418
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,630
But by that time,

419
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,090
Sander Bowie's plane had already taken off.

420
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,240
So this person

421
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,720
sent a text message to Sander Bowie.

422
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,280
When Sander Bowie was transferring in Russia,

423
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,940
he received

424
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,950
and replied to the text message.

425
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,740
Later, this person

426
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,170
made a new escape plan for Sander Bowie

427
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,020
after he arrived in Yanping.

428
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,200
The vehicles at Future Business Park,

429
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,070
the fake license plates,

430
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,000
the vehicles at the service area,

431
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,090
were all arranged by this person on short notice.

432
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,090
It was arranged very meticulously.

433
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Definitely an experienced person.

434
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,010
According to my analysis,

435
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,580
later on,

436
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,000
Sander Bowie

437
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,390
most likely met up with this person

438
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,260
at the villa in Tianli Manor.

439
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
Under Sander Bowie's cover,

440
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,420
this person

441
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,690
took away the nuclear power technology documents.

442
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,350
The people around Sander,

443
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,120
we've basically investigated all of them,

444
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,780
but we haven't found anything significant yet.

445
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,440
But someone who could make Sander hand over the nuclear power technology documents

446
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,970
and risk his life to protect

447
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,190
must have had regular contact with him.

448
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,480
From now on,

449
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,960
expand the scope of the investigation.

450
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,760
Thoroughly investigate all of Sander Bowie's

451
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,220
contacts and associates.

452

519
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,630
Division Director Yang.

520
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,240
Division Director Yang.

521
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,720
What is it?

522
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,810
We have a new discovery.

523
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,140
Go on.

524
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,160
While re-searching the Kuwei cargo ship,

525
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,870
we found a smashed phone

526
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,530
in a hidden corner of the deck.

527
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,400
After recovering the data, we discovered

528
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,070
there was a record of one received text message.

529
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,150
And it was the only one.

530
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,570
What was the content of the message?

531
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,640
"State Security is about to arrive.

532
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,200
Leave."

533
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,070
This must have been sent by the one who slipped through our net.

534
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,390
Have you checked the sender

535
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,400
and recipient's information for this message?

536
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,660
We couldn't find any owner information,

537
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,180
but through this message,

538
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,230
we were able to trace back

539
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,550
the specific locations of both the sender and receiver.

540
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,330
Where were they?

541
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,440
The message was received

542
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,550
in Sander's villa.

543
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,440
Combining this with the message content,

544
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,590
it indicates that this new phone

545
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,190
belonged to Sander himself.

546
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,790
In the early hours of the 31st,

547
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,520
when he was caught on the Kuwei,

548
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,170
he temporarily damaged the phone

549
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,440
and abandoned it in a hidden spot on the ship's deck.

550
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,590
And the sending location?

551
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,920
It was within the Tianli Manor villa area.

552
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,520
So,

553
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,790
the person who sent the message to Sander

554
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,480
must have seen our operation

555
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,350
and then sent him the message.

556
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,670
Have you checked the surveillance footage from Tianli Manor?

557
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,800
Within a 30-meter radius

558
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,969
of where the message was sent,

559
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,600
we found a white sedan.

560
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,960
Through the surveillance footage,

561
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,810
although we can't clearly see the driver's face,

562
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,520
we can see

563
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,429
the driver using a phone.

564
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,690
And this time point

565
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,750
coincides exactly with when Sander received the message.

566
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,150
So...

567
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,480
We hope to identify the person through the vehicle.

568
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,150
Let's see if we can find this car through other

569
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,150
surveillance cameras and then track down the person.

570
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,710
Hello.

571
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,969
Director Liu, it's me.

572
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,100
I need a favor from you.

573
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,199
I need the surveillance footage

574
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,580
for the entire 24 hours

575
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,800
of Tianli Manor

576
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,730
and all surrounding neighborhoods on May 31st.

577
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,960
There are four directions on those side roads.

578
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,400
Besides the Skynet system,

579
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
there are also cameras in front of the shops.

580
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,440
In total, there are over 40 surveillance cameras.

581
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,320
Do you need all of them?

582
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes, all of them.

583
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,640
Thank you for your trouble.

584
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,170
Alright.

585
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,210
You, Chen Qiu, and Tian Ziwei,

586
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,550
once the footage arrives,

587
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,750
divide the work and examine it carefully.

588
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,680
Also, have Ms. Ma

589
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,230
simultaneously investigate the origin of that car thoroughly.

590
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,550
Understood.

591
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,080
Go ahead.

592
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,090
I'm almost done here.

593
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,960
The footage from the east and north entrances of the villa

594
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,880
still doesn't show the driver's face clearly.

595
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,670
The west and south entrances don't show it either.

596
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,330
I haven't found anything yet.

597
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,670
However, the amount of footage from the neighborhood

598
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,070
is really overwhelming.

599
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,340
Could you two help me look through it?

600
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,990
[Zhounan Power Plant]

601
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,710
We have received a word

602
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,960
from the police department around 30 minutes ago

603
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,040
that our close partner

604
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,840
Moss Group

605
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,550
was actually a front

606
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,450
for the renowned intelligence agency, Hermes.

607
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,130
We sincerely apologize for not having recognized them.

608
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,360
We're truly sorry about it.

609
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,730
And I'd like to officially announce that

610
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,150
Zhounan will terminate

611
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,960
all cooperation with Moss

612
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,230
and do all we can to support

613
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,190
and cooperate with investigations

614
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,110
of the Security authorities.

615
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,920
And Zhounan will continue

616
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,040
working on developing and perfecting

617
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,270
our Gen-4 nuclear technology,

618
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,590
and continue our work with all stake holders.

619
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,090
And that will be all for today's conference.

620
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,320
Thank you all for your time.

621
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,900
Live broadcast.

622
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,670
Your superiors have abandoned you.

623
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,960
Are you willing to talk to me now

624
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,360
about who that person is?

625
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,230
I don't know.

626
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,290
You're quite an interesting person.

627
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,440
A loss is a loss,

628
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,320
yet you're still pretending to be strong here.

629
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,720
Got an idol complex, huh?

630
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,230
I lost?

631
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,370
The future,

632
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,360
who knows?

633
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,170
Back then,

634
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,880
during the Opium War,

635
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,520
China

636
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,150
was defeated

637
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,260
and fell to the bottom,

638
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,670
almost splitting apart.

639
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,840
Did China lose?

640
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,710
No.

641
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,320
You took over 70 years,

642
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,240
70 years of struggle and effort.

643
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,910
You've become the leader of Asia again.

644
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,960
But

645
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,400
did China win?

646
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,270
Not really.

647
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,700
Because the world

648
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,580
is constantly evolving,

649
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
with its ups and downs.

650
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,360
War

651
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,040
will never end.

652
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,170
Are you done?

653
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,030
Giving me a history lesson, huh?

654
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I was the history rep in high school.

655
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,840
Now we have both testimonial and physical evidence.

656
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,300
You know very well you can't leave this place

657
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,450
unless you make a significant contribution.

658
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,070
That way, you might be able to earn yourself

659
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,130
a chance to go home.

660
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,630
Since I

661
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,880
started in this line of work,

662
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,530
I never thought about going home.

663
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:56,960
Hey.

664
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,700
We're in the same line of work.

665
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,960
You should understand.

666
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,550
Just keep that attitude.

667
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,480
From now on, consider the prison your home.

668
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,520
The conditions inside are quite good.

669
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,920
I'll also send you a book.

670
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,840
It's by a Chinese writer called

671
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,920
Lu Xun.

672
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,080
The book is called "The True Story of Ah Q."

673
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,720
The protagonist in it is quite similar to you.

674
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Self-deceiving.

675
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,960
Is that so?

676
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,550
Yes.

677
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,470
I'll read it.

678
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,070
You should.

679
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,670
I will.

680
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,400
Yang Guang.

681
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,670
The contest

682
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,920
is not over.

683
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,680
The contest may not be over,

684
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,400
but you

685
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,140
are finished forever.

686
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,360
Division Director Yang,

687
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,630
be careful.

688
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,150
Tell me if you come to Yanping.

689
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,190
Let's have dinner together.

690
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,850
No problem.

691
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,770
[Yanping City]

692
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,330
Sander Bowie

693
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,290
grew up in an orphanage.

694
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,710
Later, he was adopted by a foreign missionary.

695
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,670
After he grew up,

696
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,610
Sander established a spy organization

697
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,900
called Hermes

698
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,410
in the Kuwei Islands.

699
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,570
Also, in the Kuwei Islands,

700
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,370
he registered a trading company

701
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,970
called Moss Trading Group.

702
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,190
On the surface, he was a businessman,

703
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,290
but in reality, he was engaged in espionage.

704
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,270
Later, Hermes

705
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,730
was incorporated by

706
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,070
the internationally renowned interest group, the Western Saints,

707
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,670
and became

708
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,010
a subordinate organization of the Western Saints.

709
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,440
There's another situation

710
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,670
I'd like to report to you.

711
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,000
Go on.

712
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,230
Based on the information we have now,

713
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,670
we can basically confirm that

714
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,070
there is still a loose end

715
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,840
in the Moss Trading Group.

716
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,420
This person

717
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,000
has possession of that part of the copied data.

718
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,800
So I believe

719
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,570
we can't close the case yet.

720
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,840
But this case

721
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,770
really needs to be closed immediately.

722
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,430
Why is that?

723
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,680
The current situation is very special.

724
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,290
Have you seen the press conference

725
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,080
of the Zhounan Power Plant?

726
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,960
The whole world is watching us.

727
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,260
The main body of Hermes

728
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,750
and the main suspects

729
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,130
have all been captured.

730
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,670
We must give the outside world

731
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,800
a strong account,

732
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,360
telling them that

733
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,150
we Chinese

734
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,320
are capable of

735
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,070
protecting our national assets

736
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,400
and national security.

737
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,000
Allowing Huaze Group

738
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,630
to finalize cooperation

739
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,040
with Capital City Energy Company

740
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
or other national

741
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,590
energy enterprises as soon as possible

742
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,990
is of utmost importance.

743
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,620
This is the big picture.

744
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,870
I understand.

745
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,170
Then let's close the case immediately.

746
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,540
As for that loose end,

747
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,770
we'll investigate it quietly.

748
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,920
In any case,

749
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,230
you've made an achievement.

750
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,490
The bureau has decided

751
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,020
to give you two days off

752
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,850
to relax.

753
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,050
Only two days?

754
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,140
That's a bit stingy, isn't it?

755
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,670
How many days were you expecting?

756
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,270
Two years?

757
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:54,870
That works.

758
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,330
No, no, no.

759
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,440
Wait, wait, wait.

760
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,230
That would be early retirement.
