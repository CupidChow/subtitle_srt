1
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,190
How have you been lately?

2
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,630
My business trip to Lianhai is going well.

3
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,240
We're about to officially start the project demo.

4
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
I should be back in a few days.

5
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,360
Everything is normal. Just working as usual.

6
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Have a good business trip. I'll treat you to a welcome-back dinner when you return.

7
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Hello, welcome.

8
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:04,870
Hello.

9
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,680
Ma'am?

10
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,070
May I ask

11
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,080
who you're looking for?

12
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,160
What's so good about this thing?

13
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,510
What's so fun about the games?

14
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,310
When games launch, you play games.

15
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,310
When they shut down, you play with models.

16
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,560
Why don't you just marry them?

17
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,360
Why should I go home with you, huh?

18
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,390
If you didn't keep buying this junk,

19
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,790
would we even be arguing?

20
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,630
I'm embarrassing you.

21
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,159
You think you never embarrassed me, huh?

22
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,120
Sitting there all day...

23
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,270
I'm looking for someone,

24
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,800
but I came to the wrong room.

25
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,510
Huh?

26
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,560
Tell me,

27
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,820
huh?

28
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,720
Those clothes you have—

29
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,830
which one of them did I not

30
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,160
buy for you without even asking the price?

31
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,310
Are you sure

32
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,760
nothing is going on?

33
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,750
I'm sure.

34
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,840
When will the stuff you need be delivered?

35
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,680
It should be tomorrow.

36
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,950
Who's delivering it?

37
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,560
Luca.

38
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Is he reliable?

39
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,240
He's completely

40
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,000
in the palm of my hand.

41
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,430
He will definitely do as I say.

42
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,240
Why is it so loud?

43
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,780
What kind of movie are they watching?

44
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
You can look at it.

45
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,200
Don't be afraid.

46
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm the man who loves you the most.

47
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,549
I would never hurt you.

48
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,600
This time,

49
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,910
you come with me.

50
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,270
We'll be together forever.

51
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
I don't want to be apart from you.

52
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
Section Chief Li.

53
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,030
When are Tan and the others coming to take over?

54
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,750
I'm starving.

55
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,670
The office just called and said something came up.

56
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,070
They'll be coming later.

57
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm so hungry that I can't even hear properly anymore.

58
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,910
Please

59
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,360
don't let yourself starve.

60
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll go buy you some food.

61
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,360
Call me if anything happens.

62
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Thank you.

63
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,670
I urgently need

64
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,930
a large health potion.

65
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you want a large mana potion too?

66
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Get me all kinds of potions, thanks.

67
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,120
Oh my, so troublesome.

68
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,840
You're a handful.

69
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Okay.

70
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,440
Darling,

71
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,630
relax.

72
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,470
It's going to be okay.

73
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,710
We won't get caught, will we?

74
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,370
Not with me here.

75
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't worry.

76
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,130
Let's get in the car.

77
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,550
Hello,

78
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,130
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

79
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,550
Do you know that woman

80
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,680
in the car behind us?

81
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
I don't know.

82
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,390
How would I know her?

83
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,630
Get out of the car.

84
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,080
What are you trying to do?

85
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,360
Let's just go home.

86
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,640
We must get the thing done today.

87
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,670
Get out.

88
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,170
I've brought you the food. Where are you?

89
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,030
Where are you?

90
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,390
I've got your large health potion.

91
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,870
I'm following Luca and Xie.

92
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,070
They've come out now.

93
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,890
Where are they?

94
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,530
At Dahua Supermarket.

95
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,240
But... I think I've lost them.

96
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,900
Listen carefully,

97
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,550
stop following them now.

98
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,280
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

99
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,790
What were you just doing?

100
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,840
Don't ask so many questions now.

101
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Get in the car now.

102
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,270
Quick, call the police, call 110.

103
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,240
Hurry up!

104
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,680
What have you done?

105
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,720
Excuse me.

106
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,400
Make way, please.

107
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Thank you.

108
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,130
Let me through!

109
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,590
Make way, please.

110
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,720
Doctor!

111
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,160
Doctor!

112
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Doctor!

113
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,350
Sir, are you alright?

114
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,070
Don't worry about me.

115
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,480
Are you okay?

116
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,210
Save her, save her, go save her!

117
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,340
Hello, Mentor.

118
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,270
Tan, report your location.

119
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,400
We're about to go to the surveillance vehicle.

120
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,160
No need.

121
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,350
Arrest Luca immediately.

122
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,880
Yes, sir.

123
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
How's the situation?

124
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,880
No one's in the room.

125
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
Their suitcases are still there,

126
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,720
and their clothes haven't been touched.

127
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,180
Everything seems normal.

128
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,830
Okay.

129
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,880
Contact the neighbors and property management personnel

130
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,750
and investigate anything that could reveal their whereabouts.

131
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,480
Understood.

132
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,140
Let's go to the property management office.

133
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,750
Ms. Ma,

134
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
locate Luca

135
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,310
and Xie Xiaoman's numbers now.

136
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,370
We need to act fast.

137
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,640
They're likely planning to flee.

138
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,370
Understood.

139
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Get out of the car.

140
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,530
Darling, get out of the car.

141
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,110
That girl...

142
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,240
in the car just now...

143
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,350
Did you...

144
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,110
did you...

145
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,920
What are you imagining?

146
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,920
I was just stopping her from following us.

147
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
Really?

148
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,070
Darling,

149
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,270
since I've promised you,

150
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,240
I certainly won't lie to you.

151
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,550
Trust me.

152
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,290
Come on.

153
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,550
From now on,

154
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
we'll use new phones.

155
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,500
Get rid of the old ones.

156
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,110
Put it on.

157
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,350
Doctor,

158
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,480
how is she?

159
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,350
The patient's heartbeat has stabilized,

160
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,400
but she still has

161
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,590
serious pulmonary edema.

162
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,480
She will need to stay in the ICU

163
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,880
for observation for a while.

164
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Thank you so much.

165
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,170
Who are you?

166
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,030
I'm Tian Ziwei.

167
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,930
Sweet soy milk,

168
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,330
green onion pork buns,

169
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,510
and meat-filled sesame flatbread.

170
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,240
You remembered everything I like to eat.

171
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,500
Do you have some ulterior motives for me?

172
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,680
Stay safe.

173
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,400
I urgently need

174
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,660
a large health potion.

175
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,310
Do you want a large mana potion too?

176
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,310
Get me all kinds of potions, thanks.

177
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,200
Hurry.

178
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,160
Chen Qiu,

179
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,440
they must have switched cars.

180
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,700
Find the target again.

181
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,480
Section Chief Li,

182
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,540
the signal's gone.

183
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,220
They probably ditched their phones.

184
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,130
Understood.

185
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,880
Ms. Ma!

186
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,830
Please help me retrieve

187
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,920
all the surveillance footage

188
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,110
from this underground parking lot.

189
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,550
Okay.

190
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,000
Wait, wait.

191
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,480
Have you retrieved the surveillance footage from the Dahua Supermarket?

192
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,280
What's wrong?

193
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,770
Last time I followed Luca,

194
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,350
he went to the Dahua Supermarket.

195
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,830
This time, he went there again,

196
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,480
Tian was following him,

197
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
and she got into trouble.

198
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,400
I think there must be something wrong with that place.

199
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,110
You keep following the leads regarding the cars,

200
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,830
and I'll go to Dahua Supermarket.

201
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,270
Okay.

202
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,680
Darling,

203
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,080
send a message for me.

204
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
To say what?

205
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,030
"Safely out of the city.

206
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,970
Will be delivered tomorrow."

207
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,400
Who is he?

208
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,810
A collaborator.

209
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,590
He replied, "Song, Shan, Bao.

210
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,880
Red, white, black.

211
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,720
125, 133, 142."

212
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,270
What does that mean?

213
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,830
The first three words represent three service areas.

214
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,090
Red, white, and black—

215
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,400
these are the colors of the vehicles he's prepared.

216
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,160
The numbers are the last digits of the license plates.

217
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,270
For us to switch to.

218
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,110
Can't we just drive this car?

219
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,750
There are so many surveillance cameras now.

220
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,270
If we keep driving this one,

221
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,110
we'll be caught before we even

222
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,440
get off the expressway.

223
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,160
Darling,

224
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,960
don't worry.

225
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,790
We'll definitely leave safely.

226
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,590
Trust me.

227
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,640
Stop.

228
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,200
Stop.

229
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
Xie Xiaoman definitely

230
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,520
picked this item up for Luca.

231
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,200
Take a screenshot

232
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,110
and send it to me.

233
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,510
Okay.

234
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,030
Hello?

235
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,800
Section Chief Li, it's for you.

236
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,920
Hello?

237
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,590
Jian, I found it.

238
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,110
Luca got on the Pinghai Expressway

239
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,790
after passing through the toll station about half an hour ago.

240
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,400
Got it.

241
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,640
Looks like Yang Guang's analysis was correct.

242
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,070
Luca

243
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,830
has been secretly in contact with James all along.

244
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,430
This time,

245
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
he's also probably acting on

246
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,260
James's instructions

247
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,070
to deliver goods to Lianhai.

248
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,000
Director Zhang,

249
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,110
Yang Guang is alone over there,

250
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,110
so he can only keep tabs on James,

251
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,250
while I've always been responsible for Luca.

252
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,270
I now request to immediately take a team to Lianhai

253
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,070
to assist Yang Guang.

254
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,310
Who do you plan to bring with you?

255
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,640
Tan, Section Chief Chen,

256
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,110
and Section Chief Ma should be enough.

257
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,590
Okay.

258
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,950
I approve.

259
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,240
Also,

260
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,010
Luca is very dangerous.

261
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,270
I request to be equipped with

262
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,000
the highest level of arrest equipment.

263
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Approved.

264
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,680
Depart immediately.

265
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,160
I'll notify the Lianhai authorities

266
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,490
to intercept Luca at the expressway exit.

267
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,120
Yes, sir.

268
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,560
Oh, right.

269
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,480
Tian...

270
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,000
how is she?

271
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,550
Not very well,

272
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,000
but I believe she'll get better.

273
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,010
She definitely will recover.

274
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,640
For this operation,

275
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,790
make sure everyone is extra cautious.

276
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,350
Be safe.

277
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,400
You must arrest Luca

278
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,320
and bring him to justice.

279
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,040
Yes, sir!

280
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,830
Look.

281
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,640
Just now,

282
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,760
I passed by a bubble tea shop.

283
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,070
So, I got you a drink,

284
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,680
exactly how you like it—

285
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,200
loaded with boba and packed with soul.

286
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,790
But

287
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,170
after I bought it, I remembered

288
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,060
that you can't drink it right now.

289
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll...

290
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,330
drink this cup for you,

291
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,010
alright?

292
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,200
When you wake up,

293
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
I'll buy you

294
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,720
the largest rainbow energy potion ever.

295
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,830
Ms. Ma.

296
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,830
Okay,

297
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,170
I'll be right back.

298
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,000
Tian.

299
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm sorry.

300
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,590
I let Luca get away from Yanping.

301
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
But don't worry,

302
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm heading to Lianhai now,

303
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,750
and I will apprehend him.

304
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,920
I won't let you be hurt in vain.

305
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,270
Wait for me.

306
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,640
Wake up soon.

307
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,000
Let's go.

308
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,110
Have you all memorized the people

309
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,230
and vehicles in the photos?

310
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,320
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

311
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,800
Good.

312
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,400
Now, our task is

313
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,550
to intercept them at every toll station.

314
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,280
Understood?

315
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,070
-Understood!
-Understood!

316
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,600
Move out!

317
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,230
After receiving your notification,

318
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,360
we immediately pulled up expressway surveillance.

319
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,190
We saw this car

320
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,070
enter the Songlan Service Area

321
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,000
and never exit.

322
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,520
So we came right over.

323
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,920
Did you see the people in the footage

324
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,150
at this location?

325
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,510
No,

326
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
this spot happens to be in a blind spot of the cameras.

327
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,670
We can't see exactly what happened.

328
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,230
However,

329
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,550
about a minute

330
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,920
after this car stopped,

331
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
a red domestic sedan

332
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,630
drove out from the place

333
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,920
next to it.

334
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,300
The license plate is Lian CAZ125.

335
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,960
Jian,

336
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,030
surveillance has discovered

337
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,030
that they've switched to another vehicle,

338
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,760
a white Toyota

339
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,190
with the license plate Lian PQW133,

340
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,690
heading towards Lianhai.

341
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,320
Let's go.

342
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,920
They're onto us.

343
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,230
We can't keep going.

344
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,670
Then...  we're not delivering that stuff anymore?

345
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,270
Let me figure something out.

346
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,480
Hello?

347
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,800
My car suddenly broke down.

348
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,190
I need assistance.

349
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,110
The license plate is Lian GYU142.

350
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,380
I'll send you my location.

351
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Section Chief Li.

352
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,400
Director Liu.

353
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Welcome back to Lianhai.

354
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Thank you for your hard work.

355
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,150
Thank you for your efforts.

356
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,950
Director Liu.

357
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,410
Have you found Luca?

358
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,320
Nothing so far.

359
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,400
That doesn't make sense.

360
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,590
He left more than an hour before us.

361
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,250
He should have arrived by now.

362
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,070
There are thirteen toll stations entering Lianhai.

363
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,000
Every time Luca changes vehicles,

364
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,400
I've notified everyone.

365
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,710
If the target is spotted,

366
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,070
we'll be notified right away.

367
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,070
But on our way here,

368
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,590
we didn't see any of his vehicles.

369
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,150
Could he have exited the expressway early

370
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,150
and taken the provincial road instead?

371
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,920
There aren't as many surveillance cameras on provincial roads.

372
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,280
To leave the expressway, one must pass through a toll station.

373
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,960
Then there's only one possibility.

374
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,590
Without our noticing,

375
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,800
he changed his license plate or vehicle again.

376
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,860
If that's the case,

377
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,840
I'll immediately

378
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
locate and screen

379
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,400
all vehicles of the same model

380
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,960
that passed through the 13 toll stations

381
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,880
during this time period.

382
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,590
Thank you.

383
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,030
We'll make sure to

384
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,940
complete the screening as quickly as possible.

385
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:21,960
Boss,

386
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,440
the second component has safely arrived in Lianhai.

387
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,760
Initiate the plan now.

388
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,110
Got it.

389
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,710
Finally, you called.

390
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,220
Have you got the third component?

391
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,760
I've already picked it up at the port.

392
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,550
Should I deliver it immediately?

393
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:51,920
No.

394
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,440
Luca has just safely reached the destination.

395
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,040
We still need a bit more time.

396
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,510
Be ready to enter the country and provide assistance at any time.

397
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,110
I'm ready anytime.

398
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,130
Wait for my message.

399
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,410
-Division Director Yang!
-Division Director Yang.

400
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
Speak any louder,

401
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,000
and the entire beach can hear you.

402
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Yes, yes.

403
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,780
Thank you for coming here.

404
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,670
Division Director Yang,

405
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,760
don't you have a private location?

406
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Why meet out here?

407
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,230
That place is right across from James.

408
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,710
Zhao Yaning just went there yesterday.

409
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,710
With so many of us,

410
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,450
I think it's safer out here.

411
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,550
Sit.

412
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,960
Help yourself to a drink.

413
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,690
Take a break.

414
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,320
Okay.

415
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,730
Don't blame yourself too much

416
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,820
for what happened to Tian.

417
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,360
She fell into the sea with her car.

418
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,270
The water was so cold,

419
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,160
and she was all alone.

420
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,630
How desperate she must have felt.
