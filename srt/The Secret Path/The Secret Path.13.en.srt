1
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,920
Division Director Yang, Division Director Yang,

2
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,509
we're going straight through this intersection.

3
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,710
You keep following her.

4
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,350
Copy that.

5
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,680
Hello, Director Hua,

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,560
please go ahead.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,509
Division Director Yang,

8
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,480
the test results show

9
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,120
that those two samples of

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,310
the capillary fiber mixture

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,640
you brought in last time

12
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
both came from males.

13
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Okay,

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,430
I got it.

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,090
Thank you for your trouble.

16
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,760
What's wrong?

17
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,000
The brakes failed!

18
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,450
Switch to manual gear!

19
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Downshift!

20
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,590
It's not working!

21
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,560
Press the electronic parking brake!

22
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,490
Not responding!

23
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,490
Force shutdown!

24
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,870
Press the ignition button!

25
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,070
The ignition button!

26
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,300
Still not working!

27
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,200
Don't panic!

28
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,910
Keep going straight!

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,190
Don't look. Just drive!

30
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,630
Go!

31
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,270
Division Director Yang,

32
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,070
the initial inspection of the accident is complete.

33
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,000
Ms. Zhao's car

34
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,830
had a brake fluid leak,

35
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,680
which caused the brake failure.

36
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,510
Based on the initial assessment,

37
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,170
it's likely due to tampering.

38
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,160
We'll first

39
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,870
tow the car back for further inspection

40
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,800
and then send it to the repair shop.

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You really should

42
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,830
thank Division Director Yang for today.

43
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,030
If it weren't for him,

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,020
this could have ended very badly.

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,850
We'll temporarily retain your

46
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,450
vehicle registration certificate and driver's license.

47
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Please sign here.

48
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,560
We'll contact you later.

49
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,690
Keep your phone line open at all times.

50
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,500
Thank you. Appreciate it.

51
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,120
It's our duty, Division Director Yang.

52
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,800
We'll be off then.

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,130
Okay.

54
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,130
Let me take you home.

56
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,400
Have a drink with me.

57
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,400
We have regulations

58
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,000
that during work hours...

59
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,460
It's after work hours now!

60
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,920
Why did you show up so promptly?

61
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
You were following me, weren't you?

62
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
Yang Guang...

63
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,630
For your sake,

64
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,670
I've violated company rules several times

65
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,870
and even betrayed my partner.

66
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,070
Sander Bowie is a spy.

67
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,430
Sander Bowie is a spy!

68
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,720
But when I was working with him,

69
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,780
I didn't know that!

70
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,870
After returning from Lianhai,

71
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,510
I had just had my car serviced.

72
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,830
So why did the brakes fail

73
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,190
out of nowhere today?

74
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,960
There's only one reason.

75
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,920
Yang Guang, because I helped you,

76
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,430
someone wanted me dead!

77
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,480
Then you followed me,

78
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
you suspected me!

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,560
If...

80
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,060
if I had really died in that car today,

81
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,270
I wouldn't even have had a chance to explain to you!

82
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,470
Would I have to bear that blame forever?

83
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,030
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,120
You never believed me.

85
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,470
I can believe you now.

86
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,440
Because I almost died,

87
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,390
now you believe me.

88
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Would you like something to eat?

89
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,750
I'm not very good at cooking.

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Make do with this.

91
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,200
It's quite good.

92
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,930
After a near-death experience...

93
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,160
everything tastes pretty good.

94
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,910
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
The reason I followed you

96
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,870
is that we discovered

97
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,150
Sander Bowie had another contact

98
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,320
at Tianli Manor.

99
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,250
Later, we checked the surveillance footage

100
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
and discovered that you were also in Lianhai at that time.

101
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,050
I have business in Lianhai too.

102
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,600
Isn't it normal

103
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,030
for me to be in Lianhai?

104
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Let me say this one last time.

105
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,080
Whatever you're trying to get from me,

106
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,780
you're wasting your time,

107
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,910
whether in the past or now.

108
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,240
I'm sorry.

109
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
Don't doubt my feelings for our country

110
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,690
just because I work for a foreign company.

111
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,510
No matter which country I'm in,

112
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,910
I'll always be Chinese.

113
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Do you know how much hardship

114
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,850
Chinese people face overseas?

115
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,390
When I first went abroad,

116
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,390
the bonuses I deserved

117
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
and the promotions I earned,

118
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,840
despite how hard I worked, never came to me.

119
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
There was a server in the company cafeteria

120
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,410
who would skip right past me every time...

121
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
when refilling everyone's coffee.

122
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,270
On my first birthday abroad,

123
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,340
I wanted to throw a birthday party

124
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,270
to connect with my colleagues.

125
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,860
Not a single person showed up.

126
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
But I still blew out the candles myself.

127
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,690
Because I wanted to make a wish.

128
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,390
And my wish was

129
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,770
for my motherland to become strong

130
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,150
and for me to grow stronger too.

131
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Later,

132
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,960
I climbed step by step to executive management

133
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,080
and gained power.

134
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,730
Then those same people started smiling at me.

135
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,520
But I knew they weren't respecting me.

136
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,030
They respected the power behind me.

137
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,270
So, when Leader

138
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
wanted to establish the Greater China Region headquarters,

139
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
I came back without hesitation.

140
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,480
Yes.

141
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,150
I work for a foreign company.

142
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,360
But that doesn't mean

143
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,090
I don't have a patriotic heart.

144
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,690
I will always, as I have in the past...

145
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,380
stand up for my country's interests.

146
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,640
So, I'm not afraid of

147
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,240
whoever wants to harm me.

148
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
Because I know

149
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,550
my country has my back.

150
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,160
Here's to you.

151
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,240
I smell something.

152
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,360
What? Hungry again?

153
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,520
It's the fragrance of flowers.

154
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,480
Are you alright?

155
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,320
Are you sick,

156
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,960
tired, or something else

157
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,270
that's causing you to hallucinate?

158
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,550
There's a gap between

159
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,410
someone your age and me.

160
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,140
I'm just concerned about you.

161
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,960
Let me ask you something:

162
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,270
do you think Division Director Yang's

163
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,750
IQ has dropped?

164
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,550
Don't talk nonsense.

165
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,390
There's a whole car full of people here.

166
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,450
During work hours,

167
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,200
can we really be discussing the Division Director's affairs?

168
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,660
Well...

169
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,670
you know Division Director Yang's IQ.

170
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,270
His IQ is above all of ours.

171
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,670
How else could he be the Division Director?

172
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,630
I'm talking about romance,

173
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,750
while you're stuck on police work.

174
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,630
What are you even saying?

175
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,240
It's all so vague.

176
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,040
You're just mumbling nonsense.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,510
Because of love.

178
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,270
Who?

179
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,390
If he were to have a love life,

180
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,030
at his age,

181
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,440
he... he...

182
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,170
Why can't it be because of love?

183
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
Zhao Yaning is so beautiful,

184
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,510
plus, with tears in her eyes.

185
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,040
What man wouldn't be moved?

186
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,950
Are you moved?

187
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,200
I don't know

188
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,790
whether the rest of you are all moved or not,

189
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,000
but I certainly am.

190
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,360
Do you know

191
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,840
that we have professional ethics?

192
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,200
Well,

193
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,510
Zhao Yaning might just be putting on an act,

194
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,480
and the Division Director is just playing along.

195
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
You grown-ups are way too complicated.

196
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,790
You're simple.

197
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,150
Just keep your mouth shut first.

198
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,200
That mouth of yours, apart from eating,

199
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,630
just keeps blabbering on and on.

200
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,200
What else can your mouth do?

201
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,270
You...

202
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,840
give your mouth a break.

203
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,020
Just use your ears.

204
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,080
Uncle Li?

205
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,600
Stop talking.

206
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,440
Do you believe in love?

207
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,150
I'm begging you,

208
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,350
please stop talking.

209
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,260
The traffic police

210
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,080
have preliminary investigation results.

211
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,510
The brake fluid line was broken,

212
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,960
causing the brake failure.

213
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
It was most likely sabotage.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
No matter what kind of person

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,150
Zhao Yaning really is, she wouldn't risk

216
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,240
her own life to put on such a show for us.

217
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,700
While I was following her,

218
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,410
I got a call from Director Hua.

219
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,130
The lab results are in.

220
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,600
The samples of the capillary fiber mixture found on the sofa

221
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,230
both belong to males.

222
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,080
Then, one of them is Sander,

223
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,060
and the other is definitely not Zhao Yaning.

224
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,310
Perhaps what Zhao Yaning said was true.

225
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,550
This accident tonight

226
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,720
was retaliation by the real culprit

227
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,120
who got away against her.

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,730
Then all suspicions about Zhao could be cleared?

229
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,720
Really,

230
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,270
I almost died last night.

231
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,240
Zhao,

232
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
this was your own plan.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,130
Yes, I made the plan.

234
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,840
But I only asked him

235
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,550
to create a minor malfunction for me,

236
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,150
just enough to make it seem like someone was targeting me.

237
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,150
Why did he cut my brake fluid line?

238
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,960
I don't know about that.

239
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,200
I'll handle

240
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,320
this matter.

241
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,790
However,

242
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
your risk has paid off.

243
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,510
Yeah, it paid off.

244
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,120
My reaction was too real.

245
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,320
It almost turned into a disaster.

246
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,550
He's truly insane.

247
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,920
Fortunately, nothing serious happened.

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,460
Luckily, Yang Guang was tailing me closely.

249
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,000
You must make this clear to him.

250
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,640
We absolutely cannot

251
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,700
allow him to act so recklessly again.

252
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,520
I understand.

253
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,630
Rest assured.

254
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,480
Last night,

255
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,560
did you make any progress

256
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,849
with Yang Guang?

257
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,310
Yes.

258
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,680
At first, he did suspect

259
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,920
that I was helping Sander Bowie escape.

260
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,930
But now, I think he fully trusts me.

261
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,310
Continue on this path

262
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,480
and become friends with him.

263
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,680
And if you can go further

264
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
and turn him,

265
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,770
that would be the best.

266
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,910
I understand.

267
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,680
Yang Guang holds an important position.

268
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,830
Even if we can learn just a little about

269
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,070
the intelligence

270
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,270
and information he has in advance,

271
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,830
it would be extremely significant,

272
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,110
especially

273
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,310
for our future plans.

274
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,840
You haven't told me about the future plans yet.

275
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,590
It's not time for you to know yet.

276
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,160
You always say that.

277
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,720
Do you not trust me?

278
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,960
Now that you have new, capable employees,

279
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,490
the old ones get cast aside?

280
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,880
Of course not.

281
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,780
You should know

282
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,880
that we are a team.

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,480
But we must avoid

284
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
the mistakes Sander Bowie made.

285
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
We can't lay out the entire plan all at once.

286
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,310
You've seen what the Chinese Ministry of State Security

287
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,350
is capable of.

288
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,160
Too many loose ends

289
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,070
will provide them with more

290
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,200
angles and directions to pursue us.

291
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,510
What we need to do now

292
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,270
is to stay grounded

293
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,770
and follow this nuclear power cooperation.

294
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,050
First, enter the game as a PR consultant,

295
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,840
and opportunities will naturally arise.

296
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,400
Zhao,

297
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,350
you must trust me.

298
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,240
When the right time comes,

299
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,700
I'll tell you everything.

300
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,690
Alright,

301
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,750
I trust you.

302
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
What do

303
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,720
we do now?

304
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,950
Director Zhang only gave us three days.

305
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,310
Today is the last day.

306
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Let's call it off.

307
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,200
Don't cause unnecessary trouble.

308
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,570
Our top priority right now

309
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,000
is to find the person

310
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,060
who tampered with Zhao Yaning's car.

311
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,570
If we can find that person,

312
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,650
we might have a new breakthrough.

313
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,230
Hello?

314
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,620
Yang Guang,

315
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,720
are you free tonight?

316
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,000
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

317
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,480
Dinner?

318
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,170
No need, no need.

319
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,750
We really don't need to be so formal with each other.

320
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,750
You saved my life.

321
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,780
It's normal to treat you to a meal.

322
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,920
If you don't come,

323
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
does that mean you don't consider me a friend?

324
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,440
It's not that serious, is it?

325
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,750
Come over when you're done with work.

326
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,160
I'll wait for you at my place.

327
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Wait, tonight...

328
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,820
She hung up.

329
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Blushing, are we?

330
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,270
I've noticed

331
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,640
that your relationship with her has advanced rapidly

332
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,510
after what happened last night, huh?

333
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,750
Cut the nonsense.

334
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,270
Rumors stop with the wise.

335
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,510
I didn't say anything,

336
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,070
man.

337
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,960
Besides, I think

338
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,400
Zhao Yaning has some connection

339
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
to our case, more or less.

340
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,330
You going over there...

341
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
is for work purposes!

342
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,210
And besides,

343
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,440
you've been so tired lately.

344
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
It's totally normal to have a meal

345
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
to relax a little.

346
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,620
Come on, go.

347
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,640
I won't tell anyone.

348
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,510
Go where?

349
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,200
I still need to review the surveillance footage tonight.

350
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,640
One evening won't make a big difference.

351
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,840
I'll be there, right?

352
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,350
Go, go.

353
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
I haven't cooked in a long time.

354
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,270
I'm a bit out of practice.

355
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,920
It's medium rare.

356
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,980
I'm not sure if that's to your liking.

357
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I don't eat Western food very often,

358
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,400
so I haven't developed any particular preferences.

359
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,460
Then, give it a try.

360
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,720
If it's not to your taste,

361
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,980
I'll cook it a bit more.

362
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,050
Okay.

363
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,080
It's good.

364
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,220
We're friends. Don't just eat whatever.

365
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,990
Then, could you cook it a bit more for me?

366
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,520
It's delicious.

367
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,110
Oh, right,

368
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,680
it's my first proper visit to your home.

369
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm not sure what you like,

370
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
so I picked something

371
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,070
relatively safe

372
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,400
that can be used at home.

373
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,480
I really like it.

374
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,160
Thank you.

375
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,030
I should thank you

376
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,790
for

377
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,530
preparing such a lovely dinner tonight.

378
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Between friends,

379
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,930
there's no need to be so formal.

380
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,750
Please... give me a moment to process this.

381
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,270
Honestly, I'm still trying

382
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,470
to wrap my head around

383
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,310
how we went from the state...

384
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,640
we were in last night

385
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
to being friends today.

386
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,110
Can you help me sort that out?

387
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,330
Are you married?

388
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,790
No.

389
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,840
Do you have a girlfriend?

390
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,200
I've had girlfriends in the past.

391
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Then, you should understand women.

392
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Enlighten me.

393
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,880
Men think becoming friends

394
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,940
requires a reason,

395
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,590
while women think becoming friends

396
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,790
only takes a moment.

397
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,880
Okay.

398
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you now accept the fact

399
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,050
that we're friends now?

400
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,480
Sure.

401
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,080
Most women don't like that kind of answer.

402
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,880
I hope you're

403
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,010
not like most women.

404
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,950
Thank you.

405
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,270
Thanks again

406
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,410
for the delicious dinner tonight.

407
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,120
Well, another day then,

408
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,990
I'll treat you next time.

409
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
At your place,

410
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,980
and you cook for me?

411
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,710
Forget it.

412
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,590
I can't even cook instant noodles without messing them up.

413
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,480
So, you never invite friends

414
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,170
over to your place for dinner?

415
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,060
No, I don't.

416
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,110
Out of work habits, or you're just a neat freak?

417
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,750
It's that I've already seen them all day at work.

418
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,480
After work, I really don't want to see them again.

419
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,750
So, your friends

420
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,340
are just your colleagues?

421
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,540
Pretty much, yeah.

422
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,050
Actually, our social circle is quite small.

423
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,480
How come?

424
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,310
In your work, you must often come into contact

425
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,960
with all sorts of people from various industries.

426
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,030
Those are all just subjects of investigation.

427
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,890
They'd love to be friends with me.

428
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,310
As for the people I meet in other situations...

429
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,640
usually, once they know what I do for work,

430
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,320
they politely choose to keep their distance.

431
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,550
Understandable.

432
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,640
So, no one has ever

433
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,400
invited you to their home

434
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,570
and cooked for you personally, right?

435
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,180
I can't remember clearly.

436
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,100
What about you?

437
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,680
Do you often cook at home

438
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,080
and invite friends over?

439
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,820
Not really.

440
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
Only you and James.

441
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,400
James is...

442
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,270
your company's boss?

443
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,240
Also, the one who got me into this business.

444
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,170
Which business?

445
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,540
Public relations.

446
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,110
I see.

447
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,880
So, you two...

448
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
met abroad?

449
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,200
When I first went abroad,

450
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,400
I joined a consulting firm.

451
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,700
After about 4 to 5 years, I became a director.

452
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,680
That was when

453
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,720
I met James.

454
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,410
When did you return to Yanping?

455
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,030
I was at the Leader's headquarters abroad

456
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,640
for about 5 or 6 years.

457
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,150
And another 3 to 4 years, as Leader established

458
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
its Greater China Region headquarters in Yanping.

459
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,880
I see.

460
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,430
So, in that case,

461
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,480
you were abroad and with Leader

462
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,680
for quite a long time.

463
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,080
How was it?

464
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,150
Do you still like living abroad?

465
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,190
Have you ever seen a TV series

466
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,610
called "A Native of Beijing in New York"?

467
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,350
Yes.

468
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,510
There's a line in it

469
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,590
that goes,

470
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,400
"If you love someone,

471
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,070
send them to New York,

472
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,550
because it's heaven.

473
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,310
If you hate someone,

474
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,210
also send them to New York,

475
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,720
because it's hell."

476
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,610
What was it for you?

477
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Was it heaven or hell?

478
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,790
Can this interrogation be over now?

479
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,300
How is this an interrogation?

480
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,590
Aren't we just having a casual chat?

481
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,120
Just making conversation.

482
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,110
Or you can ask me questions if you prefer.

483
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,910
I'm not curious about you at all.

484
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,400
Okay.

485
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm just teasing you.

486
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
You've already told me everything you can,

487
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,940
and what you can't say,

488
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,920
you wouldn't tell me even if I asked,

489
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,350
right?

490
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,310
True.

491
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,070
Oh, by the way,

492
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,880
I heard there's a new restaurant

493
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,070
with excellent dishes.

494
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,310
Do you have time tomorrow at noon

495
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,240
to try it with me?

496
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,150
Eating again?

497
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,510
I feel that lately

498
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,720
all we've been doing is eating together.

499
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,400
How about next week instead?

500
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,070
Is that okay?

501
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,270
Food is essential to life.

502
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,830
Eating is eating, no matter where we do it.

503
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,160
I only have an hour for my lunch break.

504
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,020
That's enough.

505
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,250
Okay,

506
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,000
okay.

507
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,590
Stop.

508
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
Rewind it to the beginning.

509
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,720
Okay.

510
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,750
Stop.

511
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,100
That's the guy.

512
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,440
At that time, he ran into

513
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
a dark corner,

514
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,310
so I didn't pursue him further.

515
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,110
Keep playing.

516
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,960
Stop.

517
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,030
The license plate number is YAN NZ9082.

518
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,400
Apply for permission from the traffic management department

519
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,480
and look him up for me.

520
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,080
Find out where he's staying.

521
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,040
Understood.

522
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,800
Thank you.

523
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,880
Division Director Yang.

524
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,910
Division Director Yang.

525
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,510
Mr. Ou?

526
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,920
Long time no see.

527
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,850
Long time no see.

528
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,150
Mr. Xiang,

529
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,240
it's been a while.

530
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
It's really been a while.

531
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm sorry.

532
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,000
When I asked you out yesterday,

533
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,790
I totally forgot

534
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,880
I'd already scheduled a lunch with Mr. Xiang

535
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,410
and Mr. Ou for today at noon.

536
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,680
I couldn't afford to cancel on any of you,

537
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,550
so I figured since we're all acquainted,

538
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,510
why not turn it into one big gathering?

539
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,310
So I brought everyone together.

540
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,880
That's great, that's great.

541
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,210
Now that we're all here,

542
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,510
please, everyone, have a seat?

543
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,160
Alright, good.

544
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,620
Please.

545
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,400
Mr. Sun was,

546
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,640
and will always be, the teacher of my life.

547
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,640
We all know the truth

548
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,520
because we were all witnesses to the incident.

549
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,310
So seeing all of you today...

550
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,720
reminds me of my mentor.

551
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,880
Mr. Sun

552
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,390
was a hero who sacrificed himself for the country.

553
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,070
We should also thank Division Director Yang and his team.

554
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,440
It was your efforts

555
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,000
that caught the real culprit,

556
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,310
bringing peace to Mr. Sun.

557
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,370
Just doing our job.

558
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,480
As for me,

559
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,920
I've always hoped that the Leader Group

560
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,000
could return to this project.

561
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
I also hope to help the project

562
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,510
proceed smoothly.

563
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,270
This is also my way

564
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,240
of paying tribute to Mr. Sun.

565
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,000
Of course,

566
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,510
I can understand,

567
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,400
Mr. Xiang, Mr. Ou,

568
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,790
that you have concerns

569
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,960
about our previous cooperation

570
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
with Moss Trading Group.

571
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,270
So I'd like

572
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,790
to take this opportunity today

573
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,350
to clarify once again

574
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,920
that our group's relationship with Moss was strictly professional.

575
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,380
We truly didn't know their true background.

576
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:18,880
Oh, right.

577
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,560
Division Director Yang can vouch for that.

578
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,390
The public parts of the Moss case

579
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,240
have already been reported in the news.

580
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,590
And regarding what can't be made public,

581
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,990
I'm not at liberty to say.

582
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,930
Everyone understands, right?

583
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
The Moss case

584
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,680
did indeed involve Leader PR Company,

585
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,880
but Leader PR Company

586
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,160
is still operating normally, isn't it?

587
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,650
Moreover, Ms. Zhao

588
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,830
has been very cooperative

589
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,230
throughout this process

590
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,040
and has provided us with great assistance.

591
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
These are also facts.

592
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,630
Thank you, Division Director Yang, for stating the facts.

593
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,560
You're welcome.

594
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,510
With Division Director Yang's assurances,

595
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,440
I do...

596
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
feel a lot more at ease.

597
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,110
Please,

598
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,400
I'm just stating the facts.

599
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,570
This shouldn't affect your cooperation in any way.

600
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,670
Everyone knows

601
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
that this project

602
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,250
is still with our Huaze Group.

603
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,800
I

604
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,360
have just taken over from Mr. Liu.

605
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,150
"Learn from the past to avoid future mistakes."

606
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,800
Under my watch, I absolutely cannot allow

607
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,760
the same mistake to happen again.

608
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,550
Mr. Xiang.

609
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,150
Yes?

610
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,840
If you choose Leader,

611
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,510
we can guarantee that you won't

612
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,150
make the same mistake again.

613
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,550
For this project,

614
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,550
our group is the best PR firm.

615
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,880
Because we were fully involved in

616
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,840
the previous nuclear power negotiations.

617
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,030
We are very clear about the requirements

618
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,280
of Capital City Electric Power Corporation

619
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,010
and understand them very well.

620
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,230
It has now been proven

621
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,150
that HTGR technology

622
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,030
is China's exclusive technology,

623
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,920
and this is Huaze Group's biggest advantage.

624
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,550
We will also do our utmost

625
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,330
to help your group secure the maximum benefits.

626
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,760
To be honest,

627
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,000
within our group, there have always been concerns

628
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,150
about Leader.

629
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
But I, personally,

630
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,130
have always believed in

631
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,000
Leader's capabilities—

632
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,130
you could say I trust them.

633
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,040
Ms. Zhao,

634
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,480
from what I understand,

635
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,510
the operator of Capital City

636
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,670
also trusts your company very much

637
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,190
and very much hopes that you

638
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,360
will join this project.

639
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,630
I suggest you

640
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,360
submit a formal written application as soon as possible.

641
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,510
Our group will also discuss this internally right away.

642
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,640
How does that sound?

643
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,600
Okay, Mr. Xiang,

644
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,840
I'll make sure to

645
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,550
submit the formal written application as soon as possible.

646
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,590
Once there's a result,

647
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,250
I'll notify you immediately.

648
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,320
Thank you, Mr. Xiang.

649
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,000
Let me raise a cup of tea as a toast.

650
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,530
Alright.

651
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,640
What are you smiling about?

652
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,030
You deliberately brought us together

653
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,830
for this meal today, didn't you?

654
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,920
Is that okay?

655
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,710
"Is that okay?"

656
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,320
The meal's already over,

657
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,250
and now you're asking if it's okay?

658
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,130
We're all friends here,

659
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,830
aren't we?

660
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,320
Yes.

661
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,040
I didn't help you much

662
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,440
at today's lunch.

663
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,970
That's not true at all.

664
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,630
Without your vouch,

665
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,840
we wouldn't even have had the chance to submit the application.

666
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,970
I really owe you one.

667
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,760
Please,

668
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,970
don't thank me with another meal.

669
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,320
I've eaten so much

670
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
with you over the past few days

671
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,800
that I still can't digest it all.

672
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,330
No can do.

673
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,250
I must treat you to dinner for this.

674
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,410
Can we wait a couple of days?

675
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,480
Okay, wait a couple of days.

676
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,800
It's settled then, a couple of days later.

677
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Okay.

678
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,880
Okay.

679
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,550
How's it going?

680
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,480
Have you found where he's staying?

681
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
After the suspect vehicle left Nanhua Street,

682
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,110
it turned right onto Beiqing Road.

683
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,230
But after it crossed the overpass at the 3rd Ring Road,

684
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,540
we lost sight of it.

685
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,520
Lost sight of it?

686
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,480
Is there a parking lot under the overpass?

687
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,810
There's no parking lot.

688
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,480
I've checked all the cameras within a one-kilometer radius of that overpass

689
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,610
but haven't found any trace of the car.

690
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,110
So I've concluded

691
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,190
that this car must be parked

692
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,850
somewhere within that range.

693
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,280
You two stay here and keep searching.

694
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
You two, come with me to check it out.

695
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,330
Look.

696
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,860
The color and model match.

697
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,570
And the license plate is missing.

698
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,480
There's no plate on the back either.

699
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,540
Let's check it out.

700
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,110
Okay.

701
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,170
Be careful.

702
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,840
Understood, Division Director Yang.

703
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,230
There's nothing inside.

704
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,290
It's pretty clean.

705
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,960
There is not even a footprint

706
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,210
on the brake and accelerator pedals.

707
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,580
The trunk's empty too.

708
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,070
This car must have been handled by a pro

709
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,200
to be this spotless.

710
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,440
It's definitely suspicious.

711
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,300
This is the one.

712
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,060
Hey, Ms. Ma.

713
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,170
We searched under the overpass

714
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,690
and only found a white Honda sedan.

715
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,640
But the license plate has been removed.

716
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,640
The interior has been deliberately cleaned.

717
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,670
I need you to carefully check

718
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,320
all the surveillance footage near the overpass

719
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,780
to find this person for me.

720
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,020
Notify Liu Weijian

721
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,800
and have their forensics team bring their full kit

722
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
to go over the car thoroughly.

723
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,130
Understood, Division Director Yang.

724
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,920
Professional work.

725
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,030
The entire vehicle has been wiped down

726
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,590
with Lidadex solution.

727
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,170
Not a trace left behind.

728
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,360
Plus, this car has high mileage.

729
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,670
It hasn't been driven for a long time.

730
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,880
Judging by the engine's condition,

731
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,960
it was probably only started again in the past few days.

732
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,490
So, it was used exclusively

733
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,710
for this job, right?

734
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,240
Exactly.

735
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,690
Another tough one.

736
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,510
It's past midnight.

737
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,320
You've had a long day.

738
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,190
Go get some rest.

739
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,790
It's fine.

740
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,480
J,

741
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,740
Huaze Group has agreed to cooperate with us.

742
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,070
Xiang Taisheng has just informed me

743
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,670
to proceed with the coordination.

744
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,110
Zhao,

745
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,760
I knew you could do it.

746
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,480
Yang Guang indeed played

747
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,710
a crucial role in this.

748
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,150
That's his value.

749
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,150
This is a good opportunity.

750
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,670
You can be more proactive.

751
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,030
You mean...

752
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,440
Start offering him real incentives.

753
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,280
How is it? Authentic?

754
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,300
Mm-hmm.

755
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,020
The roast duck is good.

756
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,140
What made you pick this place?

757
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Doesn't seem like your usual style.

758
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,800
When I first came back to China,

759
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,200
this was the place where I had my first meal.

760
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,210
After all those years abroad,

761
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,320
I thought I had adapted to Western food.

762
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,120
But in the end,

763
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,100
I still have a Chinese palate.

764
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,320
Actually,

765
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,570
I don't really like steak.

766
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,400
Every time I'm on a business trip,

767
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,230
after a while,

768
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,450
I crave roast duck the most.

769
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,820
Can't change that.

770
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,070
I know you have tasks to do this afternoon,

771
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,590
so I'll raise a cup of tea instead of wine

772
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,990
and share some good news.

773
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,320
Huaze has officially started coordination with us.

774
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,510
I need to thank you properly.

775
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,360
Well then, I should offer my congratulations.

776
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,420
Congratulations.

777
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,050
Come on.

778
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,400
Let's not be so formal with each other from now on.

779
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,360
We're friends.

780
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,960
I've noticed

781
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,320
you've been in much better spirits lately.

782
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
And I feel...

783
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,000
you're not as aloof toward me as before.

784
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,920
You've become a lot more approachable now—

785
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,840
more relaxed and at ease too.

786
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,030
That's great.

787
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,630
That's because I really

788
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,840
see you as a friend.

789
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,440
Who wants to

790
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,070
remain tense all the time around friends, right?

791
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,400
Then, may I ask you to stay this way?

792
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,070
Sure.
