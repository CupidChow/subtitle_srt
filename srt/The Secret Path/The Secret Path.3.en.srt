1
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,710
Right now,

2
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,310
China is hosting the Asian Nuclear Energy Conference

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
to work closely with others.

4
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,950
If it succeeds,

5
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,350
China and other countries

6
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,310
will be closely interconnected in energy industries,

7
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,509
paving the way for deeper cooperation.

8
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,790
And energy is the lifeblood of our planet.

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,070
So we need to

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,530
stop this once and for all.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,810
What do you have in mind?

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,960
Chinese nuclear energy expert, Sun Yaokuan,

13
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,800
is our best shot.

14
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,079
The important documents we need

15
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,560
can only be found in Chinese No.2 Nuclear Research Lab

16
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,840
and on Sun's laptop.

17
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,190
However, the lab

18
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,079
is impenetrable.

19
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,560
They have incredibly tight security.

20
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,079
Therefore,

21
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,360
Sun Yaokuan is our only chance.

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I can do it.

23
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,000
Me too.

24
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,870
Although Professor Herman is still hesitating,

25
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,030
while we've already gotten his family.

26
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,710
He'll be cooperating very soon.

27
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,430
Those will be your missions then.

28
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,400
It cleared

29
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,560
the impact

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
caused by a small particle.

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,280
According to the evaluation,

32
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,610
the power of Sun Wing generator is normal.

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,710
This is the first time our astronauts

34
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,040
to complete the maintenance mission outside the aircraft.

35
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,400
Xinnian.

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,960
Hello, Auntie.

37
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,080
Come in, come in quickly.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,740
Okay, okay.

39
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
Yaokuan.

40
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,490
Xinnian from Huaze Group is here.

41
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,630
Come, come.

42
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,750
Please come in quickly, Mr. Liu.

43
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,160
No need to change.

44
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
-You brought something?
-Just a small token of my appreciation.

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,920
Just a small gesture.

46
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,750
Mr. Sun,

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,630
hello.

48
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,950
Come, please sit down.

49
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,430
Okay.

50
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,380
I'll...

51
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,750
Okay.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Have you encountered another technical problem?

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
Ou couldn't solve it?

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,600
Mr. Sun,

55
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,240
this is the most urgent task.

56
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,130
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

57
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,520
Please sit, please sit.

58
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,490
Don't rush.

59
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Let me explain it clearly to you.

60
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,780
It's like this,

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,560
the Jiangcheng energy negotiations failed.

62
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,040
You must already know.

63
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,240
This Daine keeps accusing

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,310
that we

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
have no sincere intention to cooperate.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,190
He thinks that we Chinese

67
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,310
haven't mastered

68
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,190
the 4th-generation high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology.

69
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,270
He thinks we're afraid of revealing the truth

70
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,870
and that's why we're putting on an act.

71
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,930
It's all nonsense.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,680
It's obvious that someone doesn't want us

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
to cooperate internationally.

74
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,430
Yes.

75
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,480
Let me share some latest news

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,510
with you as well.

77
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,310
Actually, recently,

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Shoucheng Power Company has been

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,620
in contact with us,

80
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,150
hoping for cooperation.

81
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,830
However, after the Jiangcheng incident,

82
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,480
their attitude

83
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,540
changed suddenly.

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,630
I think it must be influenced by

85
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,600
Daine.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,430
To completely dispel their concerns,

87
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,680
the higher-ups have decided

88
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
to hold

89
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,920
the Asian Nuclear Summit Forum ahead of schedule,

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
originally planned for next month.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,890
Energy companies from various countries

92
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,210
are invited to attend,

93
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
reaffirming our commitment

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
to cooperation and mutual benefit.

95
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,159
This is good news!

96
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,560
Yes.

97
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,920
What can I do?

98
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,430
The higher-ups' intention

99
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,680
is to invite you as a representative

100
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,510
the information of all participants

101
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,170
to systematically introduce

102
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,600
the 4th-generation technology,

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,680
especially the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology,

104
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,720
to clear the doubts of the world

105
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,560
and prove China's

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,220
capability in nuclear power.

107
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,240
This...

108
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,800
Am I suitable for this?

109
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,470
You're being too modest.

110
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,800
This 4th-generation technology

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
was initiated

112
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,680
and developed under your leadership.

113
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,310
If not you, then who?

114
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,240
How about letting my student,

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,430
Ou, go in my place?

116
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,230
Mr. Sun...

117
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
He has been involved

118
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,530
in the entire R&D process.

119
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,870
You see, I'm getting old,

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,000
and my memory isn't what it used to be.

121
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm afraid I might remember things incorrectly

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,440
and say something wrong,

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,650
embarrassing our country.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,950
Don't worry,

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,360
the higher-ups have decided

126
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,620
that you can bring your personal laptop.

127
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,550
That won't do.

128
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,990
My laptop is very important,

129
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,720
and I rarely take it out.

130
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,830
Of course, we understand

131
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,560
the importance of your laptop.

132
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,159
We will provide the most stringent protection,

133
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,600
and the higher-ups have also decided

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,630
to request colleagues from the national security department

135
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,690
to provide technical support for us.

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,390
Mr. Sun.

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,650
Alright.

138
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,430
Since the country needs it,

139
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,810
I, with these old bones,

140
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,980
will make the trip.

141
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,510
Mr. Sun,

142
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,390
you're willing to come out of retirement.

143
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,600
My heart is truly

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,510
at ease now.

145
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,920
Alright.

146
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,130
Then I won't disturb you any further.

147
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,430
Come.

148
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,510
I'll visit you again another day.

149
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay.

150
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,360
Come.

151
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,880
Are you leaving?

152
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,680
Okay.

153
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,130
I came to see you today.

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,560
Now I feel relieved.

155
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,270
You're in such good health.

156
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,600
Okay.

157
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,480
I'll visit you again when I have the chance.

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,190
Alright, alright.

159
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,750
Okay, take care.

160
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,070
Okay, okay, okay.

161
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,360
I won't see you out.

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,120
Alright, alright.

163
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,480
Goodbye.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,950
I'll do it.

165
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,000
Goodbye, Mr. Sun.

166
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,600
Take care.

167
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:41,960
Okay.

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,250
Goodbye.

169
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,310
Why take that phone?

170
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,970
There's no signal down there.

171
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,390
Unless it's extremely urgent,

172
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,600
don't disturb me.

173
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,360
Understood.

174
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,740
You're about to enter battle mode again.

175
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,910
The focal point of this conference,

176
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,320
who is also the main speaker,

177
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,790
is the chief engineer of our country's new nuclear power plant,

178
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,550
the Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant,

179
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,550
Mr. Sun Yaokuan.

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,030
Mr. Sun is 75 years old this year.

181
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,270
He is one of the early workers

182
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,750
in China's nuclear industry.

183
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,150
He has dedicated decades to the nuclear industry

184
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,480
and is a veteran figure.

185
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,080
Mr. Sun usually resides

186
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,910
in both Yanping and Lianhai.

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Although he is advanced in years,

188
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,720
his health condition is very good.

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
In this conference,

190
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,260
he will introduce to everyone

191
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
the 4th-generation new nuclear power technology

192
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,270
that he participated in developing,

193
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,750
which is the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology.

194
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,120
This is also

195
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
the most important agenda of this conference.

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Sun Yaokuan

197
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,870
is the person we need to focus on

198
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,200
for this operation.

199
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,510
He is also an important figure

200
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,320
we need to collaboratively protect.

201
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,510
Therefore, the background check

202
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,110
on him and related personnel

203
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,130
will begin immediately after this meeting.

204
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,360
Liu Xinnian, President of Huaze Group,

205
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,510
is also co-hosting this conference

206
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,000
with the National Energy Administration as the organizer in charge.

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
He is a leader among China's private energy enterprises.

208
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
Mr. Liu, are you busy?

209
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,380
May I disturb you for a moment?

210
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,630
I heard that Huaze Group

211
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,960
is one of the organizers

212
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,720
of this Asian Nuclear Energy Conference.

213
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,120
Could I ask for your help?

214
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,270
The reception work for this conference

215
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,130
is handled by the reception team.

216
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,030
To ensure everything goes smoothly,

217
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,510
Tan,

218
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,790
you will follow the entire process

219
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,750
and be responsible for the reception work

220
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,440
inside the conference center.

221
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,080
Understood.

222
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,480
Ms. Ma.

223
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,240
in addition to the background check

224
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,030
on Sun Yaokuan

225
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,360
and related personnel,

226
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,000
we still need to collect and organize

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,030
the information of all participants

228
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,160
in this conference,

229
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,390
as well as related intelligence.

230
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,510
If you're too busy...

231
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,240
Liu Weijian,

232
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,930
you assist.

233
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,450
Section Chief Chen.

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,410
Your department

235
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,630
needs to be responsible for the investigation

236
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,870
of all surveillance videos inside and outside the conference center

237
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,600
to rule out the possibility of spies entering.

238
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,330
Understood.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,670
This time,

240
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,360
you'll be stationed at the command center.

241
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,120
What about you?

242
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,510
I'll be with the security team,

243
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,960
responsible for escorting Mr. Sun

244
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
and ensuring his safety on the road.

245
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,390
If there's any espionage activity,

246
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,440
Mr. Sun and his technology

247
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,610
will be the primary target.

248
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,360
Yaokuan,

249
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,440
Yang Guang from the Yanping State Security Bureau

250
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,750
is here.

251
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,100
For the safety of the conference,

252
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,790
he wants to talk to you again.

253
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,080
Alright, I'm coming.

254
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Yaokuan,

255
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,930
you're here.

256
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,550
Come quickly.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,390
At my age,

258
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,600
I haven't reached the point

259
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,270
where I can't take care of myself yet, right?

260
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,800
Alright.

261
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,700
Hello, Mr. Sun.

262
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,420
You see,

263
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,250
they've sent someone here.

264
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,840
Mr. Yang,

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,840
thank you for your trouble.

266
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,510
It's no trouble at all.

267
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,510
Please, sit down.

268
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,270
Actually,

269
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,540
there's nothing to be nervous about.

270
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,080
We've been through so much together

271
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,600
over the years,

272
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,390
what haven't we seen?

273
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Of course, I understand

274
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,910
that for a high-level technology conference like this,

275
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,840
the national security department must be involved.

276
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,000
So,

277
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,150
Mr. Yang,

278
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
ask whatever you need to ask.

279
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,360
Don't hesitate.

280
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,890
Alright.

281
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,030
Just don't worry about me,

282
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,480
and don't give me

283
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,840
any special treatment.

284
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,870
Don't let my age fool you,

285
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,600
my health is still good.

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
Didn't we have

287
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
a physical examination last month?

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,150
There were no problems at all.

289
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
That's great!

290
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,360
You're in your prime now, despite your age.

291
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,550
Sometimes,

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
I always think

293
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,670
if I could live another twenty years

294
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,800
to contribute more to the country,

295
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,870
that would be the most wonderful thing.

296
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,850
You've already made

297
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,240
so many contributions to the country.

298
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,440
From when you started working until now,

299
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
it's been over 40 years?

300
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,840
50 years.

301
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
It's been 50 years?

302
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,510
Back then, I was still

303
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,600
a young man in my twenties.

304
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,150
Starting from the Gobi Desert in the old Third Front areas,

305
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
I began my career

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,060
and have worked until now in Yanping.

307
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,360
Sometimes when I think back to those days,

308
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,080
it was really tough.

309
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
But now, look,

310
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,720
our country

311
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,360
has developed into such a prosperous era.

312
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,550
The country is peaceful and the people are content.

313
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,670
It was all worth it.

314
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,550
There's no obstacle

315
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,440
we Chinese can't overcome.

316
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
This way, please.

317
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,870
Ahead is our

318
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,030
National Convention Center's Grand Banquet Hall.

319
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,630
After you.

320
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
This is our Hall No. 3.

321
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,360
Our convention center

322
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,870
is an

323
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,840
integrated platform for communication and transactions,

324
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
an international platform.

325
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,320
We will create

326
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,580
a very comfortable environment for you.

327
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,790
Our venue can accommodate

328
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,840
up to 300 people.

329
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
And the environment

330
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,580
is the most beautiful in the entire city.

331
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,120
The price

332
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,050
is also the lowest in the industry.

333
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,600
You can take a look at our

334
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,150
large LCD display screen in front.

335
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,960
It's also currently

336
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,690
our most advanced LCD display.

337
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,870
Come, follow me.

338
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
This way, please.

339
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,270
The 135th one.

340
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,600
135th.

341
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,600
Yes.

342
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,030
They seem to be renovating

343
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,150
the main venue.

344
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,480
This is the newest omnidirectional signal jammer.

345
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,510
The Chinese must've made it.

346
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,870
I can't decode it.

347
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
Time for Plan B.

348
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,270
I'll do it myself.

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,120
Professor,

350
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,000
here's all the equipment needed for the experiment.

351
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,120
This floor is entirely off-limits to the public.

352
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,870
We have people posted

353
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,440
outside 24/7.

354
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,720
So please take a look.

355
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,250
Do you have anything else you need?

356
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,720
Equipment.

357
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,970
I think this is all.

358
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,960
But I have to say

359
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:32,430
I'm not 100% sure that the experiment will be successful.

360
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,910
Well, Professor,

361
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,870
I think you need to think of your family.

362
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,550
I have a feeling you will have to be.

363
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,320
This is the list of what I need then.

364
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
Hello, it's me.

365
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,089
The train has arrived.

366
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,160
We all know what we need to do.

367
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,670
We're getting something

368
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,920
out of this prior agreement.

369
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,069
Meantime,

370
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,400
there's no need for us to make any contact.

371
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,870
This nuclear energy conference

372
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,590
won't be successful.

373
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,220
What are you doing?

374
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,110
I'm working.

375
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,510
Checking the mic.

376
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,680
Hello?

377
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,270
Hello.

378
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,710
The signal is normal.

379
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,170
Position No. 3.

380
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,070
All conference vehicles arrived at the hotel

381
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,880
following the route arranged by the organizing committee.

382
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,350
The delegates

383
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,950
match the number we counted.

384
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,750
Identity verification completed.

385
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,880
No suspicious individuals detected.

386
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,400
Mr. Sun, is the air conditioning temperature too high?

387
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,640
Do you need it adjusted?

388
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,240
No need.

389
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,010
Alright.

390
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,680
Is it okay?

391
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,670
It's fine.

392
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,240
Mr. Sun's car

393
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,110
has already departed

394
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,790
for the National Convention Center.

395
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,480
Based on current traffic conditions,

396
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,140
it will take about 20 minutes.

397
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,920
Everything is normal on the road for now.

398
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,980
How about your end?

399
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,890
Everything is normal on my end.

400
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,270
Let's stay in touch.

401
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,000
See you soon.

402
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,920
Attention, all positions.

403
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,480
There are 45 minutes left

404
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,880
until the meeting starts.

405
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,790
All positions, pay attention to collecting intelligence information.

406
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,850
Report any situations immediately.

407
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,030
How is it? Is everything normal?

408
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,070
Normal, normal.

409
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,790
Mr. Sun's home is also normal, right?

410
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,440
Very safe.

411
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,330
Mr. Sun's study is in the basement.

412
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,480
It's equipped with a landline phone.

413
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,280
It should have a signal jamming device installed.

414
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,960
The protection is quite cautious.

415
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,000
He's been dealing with confidential documents all his life.

416
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,860
Caution has become instinctive.

417
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,360
Is everything ready?

418
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
No problem.

419
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,110
Signal jammers have been added to the main venue.

420
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,590
We've also made tight security arrangements with the security team.

421
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,920
If anything unexpected happens,

422
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,480
we'll immediately escort Mr. Sun away

423
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,960
along with the classified documents and his equipment.

424
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,070
I'll be personally responsible.

425
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,550
Let's hope everything goes smoothly today.

426
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:12,960
Okay.

427
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,110
Camera Three.

428
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,070
Zoom in.

429
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,770
Sander Bowie, Zhao Yaning?

430
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
What are they doing here?

431
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Are they on the list?

432
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
No, absolutely not.

433
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,510
We've double-checked all the lists.

434
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,960
Then how do they have conference badges?

435
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,760
I'll go check.

436
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,150
Keep a close eye on those two.

437
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,590
Monitor their every move closely.

438
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,320
Understood.

439
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,260
I've found out.

440
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,370
They're indeed not on the list,

441
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,880
But Zhao Yaning and Sander Bowie

442
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,160
as partners of Huaze Group,

443
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,110
were added this morning

444
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,590
at the last minute.

445
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,240
How does Huaze Group have this authority?

446
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,400
Why weren't we informed?

447
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,830
Huaze Group is one of the organizers.

448
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,160
It's a strategic partner of the National Energy Administration,

449
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,510
a leading engineering company.

450
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,160
They have the authority to invite.

451
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,750
This morning, through the VIP channel,

452
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,880
they were directly added.

453
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,140
They didn't notify us.

454
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,640
They really have some pull, don't they?

455
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,000
Just now, through our data analysis,

456
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,350
we've clearly recognized

457
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,640
that the future of the world lies in energy.

458
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,830
The future of energy

459
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,590
lies in scientific progress.

460
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,160
Today, I can proudly say

461
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,030
that our Chinese nuclear energy technology team

462
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,250
has mastered the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology.

463
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,350
Next,

464
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,030
in the second phase of the Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant project,

465
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,960
Huaze Group will be responsible for constructing

466
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,750
and officially test-operating

467
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,790
the new high-temperature gas-cooled reactor units.

468
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,550
This will be a breakthrough

469
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,880
in the history of global nuclear power.

470
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,960
Here,

471
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,480
I would first like to thank

472
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,480
the National Energy Administration for their trust in us,

473
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,310
as well as

474
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,790
Huaze Group

475
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,790
for their full cooperation on this project.

476
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,240
No. 1.

477
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,110
How's the situation?

478
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,830
I've found out.

479
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,490
Zhao Yaning

480
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,200
was invited to attend by the president of Huaze Group,

481
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Liu Xinnian.

482
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,000
Liu Xinnian

483
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,720
is the main person in charge of this nuclear power project.

484
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,120
What about Sander Bowie?

485
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,200
Was he also invited to attend?

486
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,310
Moss Trading Group

487
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,070
is a partner of Zhounan Power Plant.

488
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,310
Sander Bowie was also personally invited by Huaze Group.

489
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,370
The qualifications are reasonable.

490
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,110
I see.

491
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Inside the venue,

492
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,100
the current situation is normal.

493
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,070
Is there anything unusual on the surveillance side?

494
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,680
Nothing has been found so far.

495
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
Then I'll go in first.

496
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,070
If anything happens,

497
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,830
let me know immediately.

498
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,430
Copy that.

499
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,220
The word "nuclear"

500
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,410
has been a rather tense term

501
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,440
over the past 50 years.

502
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,310
In recent years,

503
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,260
accidents at old nuclear power plants have been frequent,

504
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,070
and calls to abolish nuclear power have never ceased.

505
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,650
In response, the scientific community has proposed

506
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,000
the 4th-generation nuclear power technology,

507
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,440
which is highly safe, produces less nuclear waste,

508
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,940
4th-generation nuclear power technology.

509
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,350
There are six types of reactors in total:

510
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,640
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, sodium-cooled fast reactor,

511
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,000
supercritical water-cooled reactor, lead-cooled fast reactor,

512
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,860
gas-cooled fast reactor, and molten salt reactor.

513
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,070
Among them, the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor

514
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,350
is considered to have the most safety advantages

515
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,240
among the 4th-generation reactor types.

516
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,480
Currently, our country has achieved

517
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,590
the commercial application of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.

518
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,350
I believe

519
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,310
in the next 50 years,

520
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,550
or even 100 years from now,

521
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,440
the word "nuclear"

522
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,270
will definitely become a friend to humanity.

523
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,900
We will make good use of

524
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,480
nuclear energy, this resource given to us by the Earth,

525
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,200
and use it for

526
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,440
technological development and national construction.

527
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,500
Let nuclear energy

528
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,350
continuously

529
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,480
bring the warmest energy to the world.

530
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,400
You must be tired from sitting.

531
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,200
It's alright.

532
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,860
Mr. Liu, thank your for helping us this time.

533
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,310
Even in such an urgent situation,

534
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,840
we were able to be arranged.

535
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,460
Actually, your presence is better than anything else.

536
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,110
Mr. Sun.

537
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Let me introduce you to someone.

538
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,510
This is the person I mentioned to you.

539
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,030
Ms. Zhao Yaning, Vice President of Lide Group.

540
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,070
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sun.

541
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,000
Nice to meet you.

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,130
I've heard a lot about you from Mr. Liu.

543
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,110
You are the bridge for many collaborative projects

544
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,960
between China and foreign parties.

545
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,510
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

546
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,000
I had the pleasure of hearing your speech today.

547
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,920
It was very enlightening.

548
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,110
I hope there will be an opportunity

549
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,160
to visit you properly in the future.

550
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,640
Sure, let's find an opportunity.

551
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
Alright, I'll be going now.

552
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,930
Okay, take care.

553
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,750
Mr. Sun.

554
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,920
Your suitcase.

555
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,440
Would you like me to hold it for you?

556
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,300
No need, just wait for me a moment.

557
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,720
Okay.

558
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,210
Just in time.

559
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,350
Security just mentioned that

560
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,790
Mr. Sun has been in the restroom for a while and hasn't come out.

561
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,650
Let's go check.

562
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,160
Mr. Sun?

563
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,550
Mr. Sun went to the bathroom

564
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,830
and hasn't come out for ten minutes.

565
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,760
Mr. Ou was worried and just went in.

566
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,750
Mr. Sun?

567
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,400
Mr. Ou.

568
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,770
Mr. Sun has been in there for a long time with no response.

569
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,240
Mr. Sun?

570
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,160
Mr. Sun?

571
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,110
Mr. Sun?

572
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,720
Mr. Sun, we're coming in.

573
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,070
Open the door.

574
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,640
Mr. Sun!

575
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,350
Mr. Sun!

576
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,480
Get medical help!

577
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,110
Get medical help!

578
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,570
Quick, call an ambulance!

579
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,200
Pupils are not responding.

580
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
No carotid pulse.

581
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,550
The patient is suspected of having a heart attack.

582
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,240
Administer epinephrine immediately.

583
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,830
Notify the hospital.

584
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,440
Prepare the cardiac resuscitation equipment.

585
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
Clear a special passage.

586
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,170
Everything's been taken care of, all is in order.

587
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,950
Division Director Yang.

588
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,240
The venue has been sealed off.

589
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,920
Except for 35 reception staff members

590
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,720
and six foreign representatives still registering,

591
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,050
everyone else has left.

592
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,880
Mr. Ou,

593
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,770
how much longer do you need?

594
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,380
The screening of all files

595
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,570
is estimated to take

596
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
about an hour.

597
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,880
Can you speed it up, Mr. Ou?

598
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,750
Mr. Sun's computer contains a lot of data.

599
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,070
It's been specially upgraded.

600
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,400
The hard drive capacity is very large.

601
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,930
This is already quite fast.

602
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,880
What if you bypass the hard drive

603
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,160
and directly access the program from the backend?

604
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,620
Tian, what do you suggest?

605
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,310
This laptop...

606
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,840
You... come in and explain.

607
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,590
This computer should have its own access system,

608
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,030
so it can quickly identify

609
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,550
the files involved in the hundreds of recent access records

610
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,920
on the hard drive.

611
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,630
This way, we can avoid opening specific files.

612
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,110
I think that's possible.

613
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,240
Through accessing the files,

614
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,310
we can check if anyone has accessed them.

615
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,910
Good idea.

616
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,680
You do it.

617
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,550
Me?

618
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,170
Yes, you.

619
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,840
Inspection completed.

620
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
So far today,

621
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,880
this laptop

622
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,350
has had three access records.

623
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,790
The laptop shows today's access records

624
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,640
were all personally accessed by Mr. Sun.

625
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,550
And in the laptop,

626
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,830
there's no sign of any copying

627
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,920
or transfer.

628
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,920
The core

629
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,750
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear power technology folder

630
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,960
was accessed at

631
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,680
1:37 PM,

632
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,830
2:17 PM,

633
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,310
and 3:33 PM.

634
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,440
The duration of each visit was

635
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,350
1 minute 24 seconds,

636
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,400
2 minutes 4 seconds, and 3 minutes 11 seconds.

637
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,350
These are indeed

638
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,110
Mr. Sun's three personal access records from the meeting.

639
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,640
Alright.

640
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,000
Mr. Ou,

641
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,070
according to regulations,

642
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,440
to prevent information leaks,

643
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,100
this laptop

644
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,350
needs to be temporarily handed over to

645
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,240
our Division Three for safekeeping.

646
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,110
Once today's incident

647
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,480
has been thoroughly investigated,

648
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
we will invite you

649
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,070
and Mr. Sun's work group

650
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,880
to conduct a second review of this laptop.

651
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,200
After ensuring there are no issues,

652
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,510
it will be transferred to Huaze Group.

653
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:03,880
Okay.

654
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,960
How is Mr. Sun?

655
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,480
I'll accompany you to the hospital in a moment.

656
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,880
But the urgent matter now

657
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,640
is to safely transfer the laptop back to Division Three.

658
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,480
I'll go for this.

659
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,680
Zhang Lei and Wang Hong can come with me.

660
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
Then you three stay here.

661
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,830
Have the security personnel assist you

662
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,880
in reviewing all of today's surveillance footage.

663
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I need Mr. Sun's

664
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,350
entire timeline and movement

665
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,350
after arriving at the conference center.

666
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,880
Alright.

667
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,960
Zhang Lei, Wang Hong,

668
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,240
you two accompany Section Chief Li

669
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,680
to escort this computer safely to Division Three.

670
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,400
Understood.

671
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,060
Tan Yaoduo,

672
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,270
you see them off to the car.

673
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,400
Wait for me in the parking lot.

674
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,830
You'll come with me to accompany Mr. Ou to the hospital.

675
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,640
From now on,

676
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,550
everyone's movements must be reported.

677
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,590
No unauthorized actions.

678
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,070
Stay in constant contact. Understood?

679
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,800
Understood.

680
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,030
Connecting...

681
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,480
Access denied.

682
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,030
Unlocking...

683
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,310
Access successful.

684
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,469
They switched the lanes.

685
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,710
Section Chief Li.

686
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,429
There's a car that seems to be following us.

687
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,070
The black one?

688
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,409
Yes.

689
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,650
For how long?

690
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,090
Since we left the conference center.

691
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,389
Drive faster.

692
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,230
Lose them.

693
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,630
Even faster.

694
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,630
Section Chief Li.

695
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,440
There's a traffic jam ahead.

696
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,280
Turn on the hazard lights.

697
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,680
Take the emergency lane.

698
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,630
Police ahead.

699
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,560
Stop following.

700
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,880
Signal lost.

701
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,670
April 20, 2024.

702
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,150
5:10 PM.

703
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,670
Sealed evidence number 00243.

704
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
Level one physical evidence.

705
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,060
Keep this as evidence.

706
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,280
Alright.

707
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,880
Thank you for your hard work.

708
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,680
It's nothing.

709
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,550
See you later.

710
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,280
Take it easy.

711
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,840
Mr. Sun has been diagnosed with

712
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,030
sudden myocardial infarction.

713
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,360
Based on his previous medical examination reports,

714
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,890
he had no prior history of suspected illness.

715
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,800
Nor did he have any similar allergic history.

716
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,280
Right?

717
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,560
It seems there's never been any.

718
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,290
Mr. Sun has always been very attentive to his health.

719
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,030
He had medical check-ups every six months,

720
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,630
and maintained a light diet.

721
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,560
His blood pressure and lipids were all normal.

722
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,670
But there's one thing that's strange.

723
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,480
An hour ago,

724
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,990
in Mr. Sun's myocardium,

725
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,440
there was a sudden release of a large amount of hydrolase.

726
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,040
Were there no symptoms discovered in advance?

727
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,090
Is this cardiac tamponade

728
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,440
causing a heart attack?

729
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:38,960
Yes.

730
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,960
You speak very professionally.

731
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,400
However, the situation has temporarily stabilized.

732
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,150
But he's still not out of danger.

733
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,190
So visits are not allowed for now.

734
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,480
Moreover, the patient's onset was too sudden,

735
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,840
it might take some time

736
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,590
to determine the condition.

737
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,110
Doctor,

738
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,280
please give Mr. Sun

739
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
another thorough examination.

740
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,630
His skin, blood,

741
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,320
digestive system, and lymphatic system all need to be examined.

742
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,980
To completely rule out the possibility of Mr. Sun being poisoned.

743
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,860
How's everything?

744
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,400
Darn it.

745
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,890
What's the situation?

746
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,280
Division Director Yang,

747
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,320
the situation is as follows.

748
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,430
This person is called Li Minhao.

749
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,840
He's a representative of Asian Energy Company.

750
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
He's from Yanbian,

751
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,280
is now a foreign citizen.

752
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,320
He followed Mr. Sun

753
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,280
to this place.

754
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,150
He lingered here

755
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,610
for nearly three minutes.

756
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,510
Then he kept

757
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,280
looking towards the direction of the restroom.

758
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,800
This aroused our suspicion.

759
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
We went to check his residence.

760
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,000
He's staying at the conference center.

761
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
But ten minutes ago,

762
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,760
he left without authorization,

763
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
taking a ride-sharing car

764
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,800
and left the hotel.

765
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,660
Where did he go?

766
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,470
We don't know.

767
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,800
Conduct a thorough investigation

768
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
on this Li Minhao,

769
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,480
especially anything related to Sun Yaokuan.

770
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,210
Understood.

771
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,150
Contact the app

772
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,150
Find out the destination of this shared car.

773
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,880
Understood.

774
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,320
Mrs. Sun.

775
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,550
Hello, sir.

776
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,880
What would you like to order?

777
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,410
I'd like two cups of coffee.

778
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,210
Certainly.

779
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,670
Your coffee will be ready shortly.

780
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,760
Please have some water first.

781
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,070
This water is complimentary.

782
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,600
Yes, yes.

783
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,440
That's nice.

784
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,440
Thank you.

785
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,580
The King of Black Gold.

786
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,450
That's pretty impressive.

787
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,630
Who are you?

788
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,670
Li Minhao.

789
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,320
What're you saying?

790
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,300
Speak Chinese.

791
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,220
Who are you two?

792
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,280
Do I know you?

793
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,050
We're here to ask you about

794
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,010
your business with Mr. Sun.

795
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,840
Hold on, buddy.

796
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,960
Which Mr. Sun are you talking about?

797
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,590
I know quite a few Mr. Suns.

798
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,630
Sun Yaokuan.

799
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,960
Oh, you mean him.

800
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,440
I know him very well.

801
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,440
We were together just this morning.

802
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,230
What happened to him?

803
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,320
After the meeting,

804
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,320
he had a sudden heart attack.

805
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,120
He's in critical condition now.

806
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,230
Goodness.

807
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,230
You see, I told them.

808
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,550
They shouldn't

809
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,990
make Mr. Sun work so hard.

810
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,000
I knew something would happen sooner or later.

811
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,280
Quick, notify his family.

812
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,000
If I sign,

813
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,400
the doctors won't recognize it,

814
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:03,880
you know?
