1
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,400
I'll have someone meet you at the north gate.

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,039
I'll send you the location later.

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,440
Great, thank you so much.

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,240
Hello.

5
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,000
Please register in the next police office

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,190
and get your entry pass.

7
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,710
Please park your vehicle to the side first.

8
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,280
Okay.

9
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,360
It seems they've increased their security measures.

10
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,800
J.

11
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,960
What exactly is the plan?

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,430
When will the operation

13
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,780
at Pengze Hotel begin?

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,750
First, proceed with the normal tour.

15
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,480
Don't ask about anything else.

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Excuse us.

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,470
Mr. Xiang.

18
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,280
Excuse us.

19
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,150
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

20
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,630
Hello.

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone, please follow me to the police office for a verification check.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Alright.

24
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,280
Please, follow me.

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,880
After you.

26
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,440
Hello, Division Director Ren.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
When I passed by the south gate earlier,

28
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,470
I saw several cars parked at the entrance.

29
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,190
They must belong to the visiting group, right?

30
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,310
Haven't they gone in yet?

31
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,560
It's like this, Division Director Yang.

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,630
I added an extra verification procedure.

33
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,910
It delayed things by a few minutes.

34
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,280
Huaze and Taiyu Group

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
have already completed the verification.

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,890
Leader will be the next.

37
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,640
Understood.

38
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,270
I'll be there right away.

39
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,510
Thank you.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,030
Thanks.

41
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,120
Ms. Zhao, Mr. J,

42
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
I apologize.

43
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,400
We only found out after arriving

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,150
that an additional verification procedure was added at the last minute.

45
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,280
Mr. Xiang, are the procedures always this complicated?

46
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,840
This verification

47
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,680
is to confirm

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,310
whether the entering and exiting personnel

49
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,190
have any criminal records in mainland China.

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
We are a nuclear facility, after all.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,710
So compared to ordinary institutions,

52
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,800
we have to be relatively more stringent.

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,160
I understand. No problem.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,950
Thank you for your understanding.

55
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,950
Alright, come on.

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,440
Hello.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,070
Division Director Yang from the Yanping Bureau?

58
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,730
Yang Guang.

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,630
Section Chief Li from the Yanping Bureau.

60
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,290
Gentlemen.

61
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,720
As the north gate can only be opened

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
when the nuclear fuel arrives,

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,159
your car can only park here.

64
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,720
No problem.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,250
Okay, please wait a moment.

66
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,310
It's Division Director Yang and Section Chief Li from the Yanping Bureau.

67
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,680
Their credentials have been verified.

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,340
Gentlemen.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,940
Please.

70
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,280
Okay.

71
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,750
Division Director Ren, they've arrived.

72
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,880
Please show them in.

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,800
Division Director Ren.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,120
Welcome.

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,780
Yang Guang.

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
I'm Ren Zhongshan.

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,680
Li Jian.

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
You've arrived just in time.

79
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,090
They've just passed through.

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,480
They've just cleared the first security checkpoint

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
and got back in the car, right?

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,830
Yes.

83
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,000
Division Director Yang,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
the matter of the nuclear power plant

85
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,370
is of great importance.

86
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,310
We have 24-hour

87
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,560
rotating guards for the most critical areas.

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Understood.

89
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,310
After receiving your call,

90
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,510
I immediately strengthened security.

91
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
The gift will be delivered on time as agreed.

92
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,510
There's a situation?

93
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,720
The operation is just one step away from completion.

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,750
Is it from Luca?

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
First, take a tour.

96
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,370
Observe carefully.

97
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,110
Do you need me to go to Pengze?

98
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,250
The operation is happening here.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
Pengze is just a diversion?

100
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,270
Yes.

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,770
Go quickly. Wait for my orders.

102
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,610
The area they're entering now is?

103
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,160
The planning model of the entire nuclear power plant

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
and technical displays.

105
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,510
For example, models of

106
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,480
the coated fuel particles used in the reactor,

107
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,950
the thermoelectric conversion station, and so on.

108
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,070
Basically, you can get a visual understanding of

109
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,950
the overall layout of the entire nuclear power plant.

110
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,950
The overall layout of the entire nuclear power plant?

111
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
Are all of these open to the public?

112
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:34,950
Yes.

113
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,680
There's no confidentiality issue.

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,360
Because for the 4th-generation nuclear power plants,

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,870
the basic principles of the six reactor types

116
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,430
are publicly available worldwide.

117
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,030
There's no need for secrecy.

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,920
I see.

119
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,750
Distinguished guests,

120
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,800
welcome to the Science and Technology Museum of Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,480
The Science and Technology Museum of Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,540
will present to you

123
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,070
the development history of our country's nuclear power technology

124
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,130
and the construction of the entire nuclear power base.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,070
What about this structural model?

126
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,530
Can it also be made public?

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
The essence of nuclear power is thermal power.

128
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,120
The biggest difference between a nuclear power plant and a thermal power plant is that

129
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,510
nuclear power uses nuclear reactions to generate heat,

130
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,600
while thermal power plants

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,870
use coal combustion to generate heat.

132
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,430
Is that the only difference?

133
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,280
Of course not.

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,430
When it comes to core technology,

135
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,800
the differences are quite significant.

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,270
But in essence, that's the main point.

137
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,840
I understand.

138
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
This

139
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,390
is the entire nuclear power plant

140
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,960
after its completion.

141
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,510
After we enter,

142
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,250
everything we see belongs to the front area of the plant.

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,670
Are these people just touring like this now?

144
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,200
Is there any risk of leaking secrets?

145
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,440
Don't worry, Division Director Yang.

146
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,700
As long as they don't enter the core area,

147
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,550
even if they photograph

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,030
the entire science and technology museum,

149
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,630
there's no possibility of leaking any secrets.

150
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,080
I see.

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,030
These are the staff cafeteria,

152
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,790
office building, science and technology museum, and the training center.

153
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,360
This

154
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,840
is the model

155
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,000
of our
fourth-generation nuclear power technology:

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,630
the demonstration reactor of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor.

157
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,390
Currently,

158
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,150
it has officially entered commercial operation.

159
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,680
The condition is very good.

160
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,390
Mr. Xiang,

161
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,080
are those structures over there also necessary?

162
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Four breakwaters.

163
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,320
They are mainly to prevent seawater erosion

164
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,360
from affecting the entire structure of the nuclear power plant.

165
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,150
You can decide whether to build them

166
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,240
based on your own geological conditions.

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
Everyone, please come this way.

168
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,160
Everyone, please come this way.

169
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,800
This exhibition board area

170
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,120
presents

171
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,270
the development history of our country's nuclear power technology

172
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,150
as well as some important features of the reactor core.

173
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,150
Unlike previous conventional reactor types,

174
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,550
our Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant

175
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,150
uses coated fuel particles.

176
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,610
This can effectively prevent nuclear proliferation.

177
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,440
Mr. Ou,

178
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,840
many places oppose nuclear power plants

179
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,000
because the fuel can be used to make nuclear weapons.

180
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,510
How did you manage to do it?

181
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,550
Everyone, please come this way.

182
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,880
Come.

183
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,390
This is the coated fuel particle.

184
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,870
What we see before us now is

185
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,870
a 300:1 enlarged model.

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,940
This coated fuel particle

187
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,540
has a total of five layers.

188
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,720
The most central part

189
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,920
is this uranium dioxide kernel.

190
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,440
In fact, in 2003,

191
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
our country

192
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,000
had already built a

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,630
10-megawatt high-temperature gas-cooled experimental reactor

194
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,430
and achieved power generation.

195
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,120
But that was only experimental in nature.

196
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,440
The reactor type we are now showcasing

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,960
is capable of formal commercial operation

198
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
and can be promoted externally.

199
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,050
It's not easy, indeed.

200
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,910
This area

201
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,320
is the core zone of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor.

202
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
The heat generated by the reactor core

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,270
is carried by high-temperature helium gas

204
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,670
to the thermoelectric conversion station to be transformed into electrical energy.

205
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,550
This square building is the thermoelectric conversion station.

206
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,150
Mr. Xiang,

207
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,840
I need to take a close look at

208
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,000
the actual operation of the 4th-generation nuclear power technology

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,720
to help me make an assessment.

210
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,150
Is that possible?

211
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm sorry,

212
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,610
but the core area is off-limits to visitors.

213
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,080
Please.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,000
My superior gave me instructions

215
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,120
this morning.

216
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,240
If I can't see it,

217
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,740
I won't be able to report back,

218
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
and it will affect our future cooperation.

219
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,480
Please try to find a way.

220
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,200
Please.

221
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,700
How about this,

222
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,910
let's ask the nuclear power plant for permission.

223
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,670
It's just a close-up visit

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,600
without entering the core facility.

225
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,260
It shouldn't be a big problem.

226
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,800
Alright, I'll ask for permission.

227
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,400
Please take everyone to the rest area for a while.

228
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,120
Okay?

229
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,880
Thank you very much.

230
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,930
Understood.

231
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,240
Yes.

232
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,920
I received a call from the higher-ups.

233
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,030
They've agreed to let them enter the core area for a visit.

234
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,560
I've received the call too.

235
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,030
But our core area

236
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,890
has never been open to outsiders.

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,400
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

238
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,960
But the leadership said

239
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
we can't let our concerns

240
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,120
affect our country's global nuclear power strategy.

241
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,240
This is the crucial first step

242
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,470
for our country's 4th-generation nuclear technology to go global.

243
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,730
How about this,

244
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,360
all electronic devices they carry

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,530
will not be allowed inside.

246
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,600
We'll monitor closely throughout,

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,240
and if any problem is detected,

248
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,040
we'll arrest them immediately.

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,330
That's all we can do now.

250
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,650
Would you like some coffee?

251
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,240
I'll have one, no sugar.

252
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,720
Okay.

253
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,320
J.

254
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,880
How did it go, Mr. Xiang?

255
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
It's finally been approved.

256
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,440
However,

257
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,510
Leader, Huaze, and Taiyu,

258
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,030
each group can only send one representative.

259
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,560
Please leave all electronic devices behind,

260
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,450
including watches.

261
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,790
Hand them over to your companions.

262
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,320
But...

263
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,410
Manager Li,

264
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,360
Huaze Group

265
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,670
has always approached this with the utmost sincerity

266
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,440
in wanting to cooperate with you.

267
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
Mr. Xiang must have made

268
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
the greatest effort to secure this.

269
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,600
This is my job.

270
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,960
Alright, I accept.

271
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,900
I'll represent Leader Group.

272
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,510
Okay.

273
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,550
Please, everyone, prepare separately.

274
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:01,910
Alright.

275
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,240
Okay.

276
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Your task is to wait patiently.

277
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,290
Okay.

278
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,030
This way, please.

279
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,790
Let's go then.

280
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,849
Alright, let's go.

281
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,520
They've reached the entrance of the core area.

282
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
That's fine, sir.

283
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,350
Wait a moment.

284
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,790
Sir,

285
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,100
we need to check your cane as well.

286
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,790
I have a problem with my leg.

287
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,920
I use it for walking.

288
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,910
Thank you.

289
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,020
Follow me, please.

290
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,440
The device has successfully connected.

291
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,210
Come with me.

292
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,880
I sent to you a gift.

293
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,200
Check it.

294
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,720
I got it.

295
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,030
I've hidden it in a safe place.

296
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,480
No one will ever find it.

297
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,310
Good.

298
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,440
It will be very helpful in critical moments.

299
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,030
It's actually an antenna device

300
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,160
that can receive all data generated

301
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,720
during the operation of the nuclear power plant

302
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,790
in a very short time.

303
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,160
It's the most crucial part of our plan.

304
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,920
And it has a built-in system

305
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,220
to allow you to pass the security checks.

306
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,640
We've reached this area.

307
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,880
I'm the only one who can bring you in here.

308
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,510
Thank you for your hard work.

309
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,310
Come, please.

310
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,510
Please take off your hats.

311
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,040
Alright.

312
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,400
Come.

313
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,480
Please.

314
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,000
Come.

315
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Please.

316
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,270
Data transmission.

317
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,330
Division Director Ren.

318
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,030
I've heard that other countries are also fully engaged in R&D

319
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,270
the HTGR technology

320
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,820
They even built an experimental reactor last year.

321
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,830
So, they haven't

322
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,480
fully mastered 4th-generation nuclear technology.

323
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,920
Is it due to technical issues?

324
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,160
Or in other words,

325
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,900
if they want to quickly narrow

326
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,670
the gap with our country,

327
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,160
what do they need most?

328
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,720
What they need most is

329
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,270
actual operational data.

330
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,640
Operational data?

331
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,110
Yes.

332
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
Where are these data stored?

333
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,240
It's in the central control room they visited.

334
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,590
Right here?

335
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,120
Correct.

336
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,510
This place

337
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,880
is the control room for the 4th-generation

338
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,590
SMR modular reactor.

339
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,030
Our 4th-generation reactor

340
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,830
has the feature of multi-module flexibility.

341
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,790
It's currently the safest reactor in the world.

342
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,750
The nuclear power plant layout.

343
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,610
Could you bring it up for me to see?

344
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,680
Manager Li.

345
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,880
Quite impressive.

346
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,400
Very impressive.

347
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,400
This is currently

348
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,200
the world's first

349
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,070
and also the only

350
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,670
4th-generation modular commercial reactor.

351
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,240
On this side of the breakwater,

352
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,640
that's the ocean, right?

353
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,590
Is there any defense?

354
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,030
No.

355
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,680
Why?

356
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,070
It's too far from the core area. There's no need.

357
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,200
This is also international practice.

358
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,400
Mr. J,

359
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,030
you can't enter the restricted area.

360
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,630
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,680
You keep an eye here.

362
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,350
I'll go take a look.

363
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,830
Okay.

364
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,550
Data transmission.

365
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
Data transmission.

366
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,750
Hey,

367
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,750
I'm now

368
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,640
at the end of the breakwater.

369
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,960
There's a lighthouse here.

370
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,480
Something doesn't look quite right.

371
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,540
Come over quickly.

372
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,110
Data transmission.

373
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,510
Data transmission.

374
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,450
Yang Guang!

375
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Luca.

376
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,130
Leave him to me.

377
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,120
Over there, Tan Yaoduo.

378
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,550
Manager Li,

379
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,440
we've seen everything we needed to see.

380
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,160
I suggest we end the tour

381
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,510
and sign the contract as soon as possible.

382
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,550
That's the real business.

383
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,750
Mr. J is right.

384
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,200
I can't wait.

385
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:08,750
Please.

386
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,270
Excuse me, where is the restroom?

387
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,930
It's over there.

388
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,110
Okay.

389
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,540
See you in a bit.

390
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,750
What's going on, Division Director Yang?

391
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,280
James...

392
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,640
Find James

393
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,920
and arrest him immediately.

394
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,240
Control room, control room,

395
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,170
lock onto James.

396
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Lock onto James.

397
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,790
Division Director Ren.

398
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,590
James just drove out of the gate.

399
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,720
He's gone.

400
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,790
Can I use your car?

401
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,030
Here.

402
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,270
Find Zhao Yaning and arrest her immediately.

403
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,800
Yes, sir.

404
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,640
Control room, control room,

405
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,900
lock onto Zhao Yaning.

406
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,790
If you find her,

407
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,190
arrest her immediately.

408
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,240
Mentor.

409
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,750
I can't go on.

410
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,070
You're no match for me.

411
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,560
You're still too green.

412
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,250
Don't move.

413
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,320
Let him go.

414
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,910
Don't just sit there.

415
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,830
Handcuff him.

416
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Zhao Yaning!

417
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,670
Are you crazy?

418
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,230
Do you know what you're doing?

419
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,850
I'm handing him over to you.

420
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,150
Zhao!

421
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,110
You've betrayed Leader.

422
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,000
The Boss won't let you off.

423
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Stop right there.

424
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,960
Why?

425
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,280
This is my job.

426
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,710
What job?

427
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,130
You don't have the clearance to know.

428
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,620
If you don't explain clearly,

429
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,670
I'll still arrest you today.

430
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,980
Yang Guang,

431
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,710
I'm under the jurisdiction of your superiors.

432
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,930
You'll know about these things later.

433
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,070
I need to leave here quickly.
