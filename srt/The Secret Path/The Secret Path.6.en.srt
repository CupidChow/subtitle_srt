1
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,400
Due to the unique alkaloid nature of this toxin,

2
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,570
it evaded the first round of

3
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,850
blood tests during the examination.

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,560
TTX toxin?

5
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,200
Pufferfish toxin TTX is an alkaloid,

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
one of the most potent

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,509
neurotoxins found

8
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,920
in nature.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,430
Just 0.5 milligrams can be fatal.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,070
Pufferfish poisoning victims

11
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,470
generally show symptoms

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,790
within 10 to

13
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,470
45 minutes

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,090
after consuming pufferfish.

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,300
However, some people may experience

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,530
delayed onset up to three hours later.

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,280
This is a characteristic of natural toxins.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,630
Since this toxin can block signal transmission

19
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,240
between nerves in the human body,

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,360
and control the uncontrollable blood flow

21
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,440
during sudden cardiac arrest.

22
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,110
Therefore, if this toxin

23
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,240
is successfully developed

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,400
into a medication,

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,430
it could have unimaginable therapeutic effects

26
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,310
on heart disease treatment.

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,840
However, if this toxin

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,160
is developed to become a poison,

29
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,630
people can utilize its

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,130
natural delayed action

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
to control the onset time of poisoning.

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
In other words,

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
it can cause the poisoned person

34
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,570
to show symptoms hours later.

35
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,910
And this is exactly what happened to Mr. Sun.

36
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,470
This means

37
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,120
Mr. Sun was already poisoned

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,630
before entering the conference center?

39
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,310
Based on the clues we have now,

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,280
Mr. Sun appeared at

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Huasong Restaurant with Herman

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,750
four hours before the poison took effect.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,550
Then that was not a coincidence.

44
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,720
Huasong Restaurant

45
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,520
is very likely the place

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,160
where they poisoned Mr. Sun.

47
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,120
Hello, welcome.

48
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,960
How many do we have here?

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
This way, please.

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,310
Here.

51
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,240
These two are most likely

52
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,480
from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

53
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,950
Both very powerful men.

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,000
That's why

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we need your help.

56
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,480
I understand.

57
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,120
How do you feel to be an author?

58
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,750
I'd honestly rather be an assassin.

59
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,310
I told you, boy, to be cautious and keep a profile.

60
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,630
I hired four ghostwriters and paid for marketing and PR

61
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,360
to cement your status of a new author,

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,480
You may just become famous from this.

63
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,120
It would be better than.

64
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,650
I wanna keep this identity.

65
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,510
And then,

66
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,870
that woman, your translator,

67
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,680
she is crucial to the next step of plan.

68
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, I know the plan.

69
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,800
To make sure nothing goes wrong there.

70
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,830
Have I ever disappointed you

71
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,130
since joining Hermes?

72
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,430
No. You've always been proactive.

73
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,900
You know, I never question your accountabilities.

74
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,720
But I have to remind you

75
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,960
because of the importance of this mission.

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,920
Trust me,

77
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,870
Sander.

78
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,830
Egg fried rice, your favourite dish

79
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,950
at the orphanage.

80
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,960
Do you still remember that?

81
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,290
Of course, you always help my back.

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
This is in your hands.

83
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,720
Based on our investigation at this stage,

84
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,050
at Huasong Restaurant,

85
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,870
under the seat where Mr. Sun sat,

86
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,160
traces of TTX toxin were found.

87
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,390
From this, we can confirm that

88
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,250
Huasong Restaurant was the scene of the poisoning.

89
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,960
We can now conclude that

90
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,280
Moss Trading Group is the organization behind

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,680
poisoning Mr. Sun and deliberately stealing

92
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,630
our country's

93
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,000
major technological secrets.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,120
The evidence is conclusive.

95
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,850
Can we start to arrest them now?

96
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,120
Well done.

97
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,100
We're getting close to the truth,

98
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,380
but it's not time to make arrests yet.

99
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,010
According to our analysis,

100
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,480
there must be bigger moves behind them.

101
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,030
So what we need to do now is

102
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,410
uncover the deeper hidden enemies

103
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,530
and the masterminds behind it all.

104
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,790
Goodness.

105
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,240
Goodness.

106
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,030
Goodness.

107
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,790
Goodness.

108
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm home.

109
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,120
Goodness.

110
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,550
I'm home!

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,060
Where is everyone?

112
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,240
Goodness.

113
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,120
Hey!

114
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Hey, where is everybody?

115
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm back!

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,140
Where is everyone?

117
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,010
They knew I was coming back,

118
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,200
but there's no one here?

119
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
Are they that busy?

120
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,790
Oh my god, this...

121
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,640
Wasn't I just acting for nothing here?

welcome back to the team!

129
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,360
Mr. She,

130
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,430
if you have any opinions,

131
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,930
please speak frankly.

132
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,150
Yes, Mr. She,

133
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,270
we totally can communicate openly.

134
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
the demo (sample) of For technical presentation

135
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,030
your side

136
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,320
provided,

137
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,910
I'm not very satisfied with it.

138
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,870
I need a

139
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
more detailed demo

140
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,960
that includes specific operational data

141
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,510
and computation library segments.

142
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,270
Sorry, but this is

143
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,670
what my superiors are requiring of me.

144
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,550
If you want to see the specific data

145
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,720
and computation library segments,

146
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,150
the demo will be presented in Lianhai.

147
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
Why not in Yanping?

148
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,670
A key piece of data for this technology

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,840
was jointly researched and developed

150
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,000
by Zhounan Power Plant and the Lianhai branch.

151
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,840
So,

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,440
holding it in Lianhai

153
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,600
ensures its security.

154
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,960
The day after tomorrow,

155
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,320
May 11th,

156
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,790
is the date okay?

157
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,080
Okay.

158
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,130
I'll try to arrange it.

159
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,090
You need to go to Lianhai for investigation?

160
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,600
According to the news,

161
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,630
the Moss Trading Group

162
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,390
commissioned Leader PR Company

163
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,450
as an intermediary

164
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,000
to invite representatives from the capital

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,510
and Zhounan Power Plant

166
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,150
to their Moss branch in Lianhai

167
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,200
for a

168
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,200
4th-generation technology

169
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,150
demonstration.

170
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,000
However, based on our judgement,

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,910
it's absolutely impossible that

172
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,790
they have mastered 4th-generation technology.

173
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,600
This is the first suspicious point.

174
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,870
The second suspicious point is,

175
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,440
why did Moss Trading Group

176
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,030
insist on choosing their Lianhai branch

177
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,960
for this technology demonstration?

178
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,290
Everyone is in Yanping,

179
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
and Yanping's facilities and conditions

180
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,390
are more convenient than Lianhai's.

181
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,990
Why go so far out of their way?

182
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,960
I think there must be something behind this.

183
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,030
So I came here today

184
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,080
to request your permission

185
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
to make a trip to Lianhai.

186
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,440
Be mindful of your approach.

187
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,240
We're just one step away from exposing the truth.

188
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,390
We can't be rash.

189
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,200
I understand.

190
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,240
I won't cause any unnecessary impact.

191
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,150
For your trip to Lianhai,

192
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,080
do you need me to assign someone to go with you?

193
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,630
No, no,

194
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,750
I can go alone.

195
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,840
A smaller target

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
is more discreet.

197
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,600
In that case,

198
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,960
hasn't Li Jian been discharged from the hospital?

199
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
He can go with you,

200
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
to provide some support.

201
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
Is his brain getting better?

202
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,480
Wouldn't it be so much trouble

203
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,320
if I have to take care of him?

204
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,550
Neither of you should criticize the other.

205
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,610
Neither of you gives me peace of mind.

206
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,790
The target has entered the departure hall.

207
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,480
No, no, thank you.

208
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,960
Division Director Yang,

209
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,840
the target has just left the airport

210
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,700
and entered Lianhai's downtown.

211
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,760
Understood.

212
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Keep monitoring.

213
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,440
You've been getting quite close to Tian lately,

214
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,600
haven't you?

215
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,320
It's work-related.

216
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,870
I'm not talking about work.

217
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,120
I just found that

218
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,960
your overtime work and such...

219
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
Do you have news?

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,510
What news do you mean?

221
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,150
What's going on with you?

222
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Why are you so concerned about Tian?

223
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,980
Isn't she a new member?

224
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,870
A rookie.

225
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,320
Of course I need to pay attention.

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,550
When we first joined Division Three,

227
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,360
didn't Director Zhang pay close attention to us too?

228
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,020
Well, well.

229
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
Then for your action team,

230
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,080
when Zhang Lei, Wang Hong,

231
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,480
and Tan Yaoduo joined the team,

232
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,280
why weren't you this attentive?

233
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,570
Don't tease me, I...

234
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,420
I'm just asking casually.

235
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,150
I don't mean anything by it.

236
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,410
Why are you so nervous?

237
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,260
I don't mean anything either.

238
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,440
Oh my!

239
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,390
I just noticed that

240
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,870
when she was seeing us off,

241
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,330
she was smiling brightly.

242
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,200
I thought it was because of you.

243
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,870
Why do you assume it's because of me?

244
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,110
Why don't you think it's because of you?

245
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,720
Is that so?

246
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,120
Interesting.

247
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,090
Tian has sent another message.

248
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,650
Should I listen to it or not?

249
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,390
Don't talk nonsense.

250
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,630
The surveillance team says

251
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,090
they expect to arrive at the hotel in an hour.

252
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,760
Understood.

253
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,960
Drive quickly.

254
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,390
Yeah.

255
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,990
They've all arrived.

256
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,170
Are our rooms arranged?

257
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,440
Ms. Ma says they're on the seventh floor.

258
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,030
Zhao Yaning is in room 716.

259
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,310
Sander is in 718.

260
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,160
The others' rooms are arranged in sequence.

261
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
Our room is 707,

262
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,280
the one closest to the elevator.

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,720
Mr. Sander.

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,920
Ms. Zhao?

265
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,830
Well,

266
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,310
I suddenly want to

267
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,350
host a dinner for Mr. She,

268
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,320
to make the atmosphere a bit more cheerful.

269
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Do you think that's appropriate?

270
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,660
No problem.

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,930
I'll arrange it.

272
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,530
Are they here for vacation?

273
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,310
You'll go in too, get a room near them.

274
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,930
Me alone? You're not going?

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
I need to watch them outside,

276
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,960
in case they have someone to assist them

277
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,220
or if there's any unexpected situation.

278
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,470
How can one person sing this song alone?

279
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,390
What's wrong?

280
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,790
Can't a person sing alone now?

281
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,270
Yeah.

282
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,010
Can you sing if Tian is here?

283
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,000
You...

284
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,980
What are you doing?

285
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,350
Don't drink alcohol.

286
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,920
Mr. She.

287
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,910
Great!

288
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,480
Great.

289
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,080
No, no, no.

290
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,390
Please don't.

291
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,480
Don't, don't.

292
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,720
Come on, come on.

293
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,720
Keep dancing.

294
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,750
I found that

295
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,690
they're drinking quite happily.

296
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,110
They couldn't really have mastered

297
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,640
the 4th-generation technology, could they?

298
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,590
That's impossible?

299
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
I can't figure it out.

300
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,480
Thank you.

301
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:16,960
Oh no.

302
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,150
What's wrong?

303
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,070
I drank tea and now I can't sleep.

304
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,000
That's perfect.

305
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,030
You keep watch for a while,

306
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,760
I'll sleep for two hours and then switch with you.

307
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,370
You're quite cunning.

308
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
Say one more word and I'll send you back to Yanping.

309
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,510
J.

310
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,120
Everything is going smoothly as planned.

311
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,000
Mm-hmm.

312
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,680
Don't worry.

313
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
I understand.

314
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,730
The presentation shall begin.

315
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,860
It's been an hour already.

316
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,690
Could they have signed the contract already?

317
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
It seems things didn't go smoothly.

318
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,640
J.

319
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,870
It just ended.

320
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,400
Yes.

321
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,750
Yes.

322
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Sander and other have already returned to their rooms.

323
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
She Shiyuan has already left.

324
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,750
It was really awkward.

325
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,530
I'm still observing the situation here.

326
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,350
Yes.

327
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,800
Correct.

328
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,920
We might have all been deceived by Sander and his team.

329
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,110
The technology demonstration was a complete failure.

330
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,240
I suspect Sander and his team don't actually have

331
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,550
4th-generation nuclear power technology.

332
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,880
Then why did they ask people to go to Lianhai?

333
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,830
I'm not sure at the moment.

334
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,960
I'm investigating.

335
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,110
Should we continue our cooperation with them?

336
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,860
The technical issues are Sander's problem.

337
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,200
We're only responsible for public relations.

338
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,930
We just need to cooperate well.

339
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,730
You understand what I mean.

340
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,360
Alright.

341
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,550
I understand.

342
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,830
I'm not sure at the moment.

343
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm investigating.

344
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,110
Should we continue our cooperation with them?

345
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,840
Alright.

346
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,040
I understand.

347
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,920
I was wondering why these two people

348
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,960
never left their rooms after they got in.

349
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,200
So they feel quite depressed.

350
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,790
Don't they know

351
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,790
if they really have the technology?

352
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,920
All that effort

353
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,440
just to demonstrate a failed technology.

354
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,290
What kind of logic is that?

355
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,850
Tian sent a message.

356
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,680
Sander and Duke have booked

357
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,540
tickets for three hours from now.

358
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,460
Returning to Yanping?

359
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,670
They're going back already?

360
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,580
Sander and Duke are withdrawing.

361
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,830
I'm not used to this car.

362
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,660
It's safer to drive a local car to follow.

363
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,690
This is the road to the airport.

364
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,930
They really came for a tour?

365
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,200
It seems this technology demonstration

366
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,660
was indeed unsuccessful.

367
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,790
They have no choice but to return to Yanping.

368
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,920
This further confirms Director Zhang's and my deduction

369
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,880
that they don't actually

370
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
master the 4th-generation technology.

371
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,880
Are they this casual?

372
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,960
It's not like their previously rigorous style.

373
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,680
Follow our plan.

374
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,830
We have 2 hours.

375
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,270
Will do.

376
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,590
Oh my god.

377
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm sorry.

378
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Ma'am,

379
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,530
Let me help you unbuckle your seatbelt first.

381
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,030
Is my baby okay?

382
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,230
Division Director Yang!

383
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,840
Please don't be nervous.

384
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,070
A pregnant woman.

385
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Did you hit your head?

386
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,860
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

387
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,350
Any discomfort in your abdomen?

388
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,200
My belly seems to hurt a bit.

389
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,400
Don't worry, Madam.

390
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,970
I'll call an ambulance for you right away.

391
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Can we go to the hospital now?

392
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,750
Okay.

393
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Let's use our car to drive her there.

394
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,070
Please lean back.

395
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,160
I won't fasten this lower strap for you.

396
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,220
I'll fasten this upper strap for you.

397
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,200
Let's take her to the hospital first.

398
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,310
It's not far from here to the airport.

399
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,110
I'll figure it out myself.

400
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,640
Alright.

401
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,300
Please come in.

402
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,810
Hey, Tian Ziwei.

403
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,810
Can you help me check

404
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,280
if Sander Bowie boarded?

405
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,440
Division Director Yang,

406
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,640
the information shows they've already checked in.

407
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,790
Ask Ms. Ma to contact

408
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,960
the airport surveillance room,

409
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,690
requesting their assistance.

410
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,310
Among these boarding passengers,

411
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,000
are there any suspects you're looking for?

412
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,660
Nothing has been found so far.

413
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,100
But they're all queuing here.

414
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,680
Business class, first class,

415
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,880
they're all here too.

416
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,360
Nothing will be missed.

417
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,010
They've checked in,

418
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,360
but haven't boarded.

419
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,510
This is a bit strange.

420
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,400
Are these all the airport surveillance cameras?

421
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,790
No.

422
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,720
Can you switch to another set for me?

423
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,050
Sure.

424
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,540
Arrival floor.

425
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,790
Gate 3.

426
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,480
Zoom in on the image.

427
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,940
Zoom in.

428
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,600
There.

429
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,480
Yes.

430
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,770
It's these two people.

431
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Keep an eye on them for me.

432
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,440
Okay.

433
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,930
Hey, Tian Ziwei.

434
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
Help me contact the Lianhai Traffic Bureau.

435
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,960
Monitor Lian B77954.

436
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,350
A black Toyota car.

437
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,510
Keep me updated

438
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,400
on its location information.

439
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,660
Yes.

440
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,510
There's one more thing.

441
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,270
Could you do me a favor?

442
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,800
Go ahead.

443
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,830
Can I borrow a car?

444
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,030
My car is a bit small.

445
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,880
Is that okay?

446
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,540
Hello, Tian Ziwei.

447
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,660
I just passed highway No. 321.

448
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,610
Where are they?

449
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,880
Division Director Yang,

450
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,830
they're now at No. 355,

451
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,640
about four kilometers ahead of you.

452
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,790
Which direction are they heading?

453
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,680
They've entered the road on the right,

454
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,070
heading towards Jinzhou.

455
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,640
Jinzhou?

456
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,270
Yes,

457
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,030
it should be Jinzhou.

458
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,350
Mr. Sun's hometown is Jinzhou.

459
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,000
They must have something to do there.

460
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,130
Keep tracking them.

461
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,160
We don't have much time.

462
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,790
Is this the way?

463
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,880
Trust me.

464
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,510
Hello, Mrs. Sun.

465
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,780
This is Yang Guang.

466
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Oh, Yang Guang.

467
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,210
I'd like to ask you something.

468
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,550
Back then, how long

469
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
did you live in Jinzhou with Mr. Sun?

470
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,720
For about three or four years.

471
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,530
During these years,

472
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,350
has Mr. Sun done any research in nuclear power?

473
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,070
Yes, he has.

474
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,510
For this time's design,

475
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,920
most of the key breakthroughs

476
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,270
were made in his old study in Jinzhou.

477
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,960
Could you give me the address of his old study?

478
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,020
What's the matter?

479
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,640
It's nothing, nothing.

480
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Just doing a simple investigation.

481
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,110
2-1008, Nanhu Villa, Jinzhou District.

482
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,790
Got it.

483
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,370
Thank you, Mrs. Sun.

484
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,150
Hey, are you done?

485
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,490
Almost.

486
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,840
I've tracked

487
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,840
Sander Bowie and Duke.

488
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,210
They should have come to

489
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,080
the villa where Mr. Sun used to live in Jinzhou.

490
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,610
The two of them should have sneaked in by now.

491
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm right at the entrance of the villa.

492
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,770
When you're done, hurry over here.

493
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,400
The address is 2-1008, Nanhu Villa,

494
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,770
Jinzhou District,

495
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,550
Alright, be careful.

496
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay.

497
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,190
What's the matter with him?

498
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,760
He was unconscious when brought in.

499
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,590
A passerby found him on the street.

500
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,880
He had no ID on him,

501
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,130
just a mobile phone.

502
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,710
But the phone

503
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,920
has passwords,

504
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,160
so we can't turn it on.

505
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,360
We don't know what he does,

506
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,110
and we can't contact any family members.

507
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,510
Alright, let's hurry and start the rescue.

508
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,150
Dr. Wang, the patient's phone is ringing.

509
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,750
Answer it.

510
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,870
How could you be here?

511
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,640
I think I saw you at the hotel today.

512
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,840
When I finished my work

513
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,190
and tried to call you,

514
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,210
a doctor from the community hospital answered.

515
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,030
They said after your accident,

516
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,490
someone took you to the community hospital.

517
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,510
Then, following their request,

518
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,440
I had you transferred to Lianhai People's Hospital.

519
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,690
Your impact was quite severe.

520
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
You have internal chest injuries

521
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,670
and a mild concussion.

522
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,630
Fortunately,

523
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,110
your ribs only have minor fractures.

524
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,600
However, if not treated promptly,

525
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,550
it could lead to internal chest bleeding,

526
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,150
which would be very serious.

527
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,550
Why did you save me?

528
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,710
Why did I save you?

529
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,960
It's basic morality.

530
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,400
We've known each other at least,

531
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,000
so I couldn't just see you die in a foreign town.

532
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,650
Ms. Zhao, you're quite a good person.

533
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,800
Hmm.

534
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,590
Don't move yet.

535
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,110
Why do I feel like

536
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,480
you always appear around me?

537
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,290
Well, get some rest, Mr. Yang.

538
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,320
I'm leaning.

539
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:46,840
Thank you.

540
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,710
Alethea.

541
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,210
Bye-bye, Sonny.

542
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,850
What's going on?

543
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,320
Why is she here?
