[Episode 19]

3
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,940
How about we chug one bottle straight?

4
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,170
Not just one bottle,

5
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,400
let's do what we did in Capital City.

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
Three bottles plus a bomb shot,

7
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,759
okay?

8
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,200
Good!

9
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,350
Okay, sure, sure!

10
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,390
-Okay?
-Okay!

11
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,590
Three bottles it is!

12
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,200
Three bottles!

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,509
Three bottles!

14
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:49,950
Come on.

15
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,479
Okay!

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,460
Count down from three.

17
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,200
Three,

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,310
two,

19
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,000
one.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,560
Go!

21
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,150
Yang Guang, you got this!

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,150
Taylor, come on!

23
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,640
Let's go, Leader Group!

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,020
Keep it up, Yang Guang!

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,480
Almost there, second bottle now!

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,540
Hurry up, hurry up!

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,400
Faster, you idiot!

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,300
What are you doing?

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,680
Third bottle, third bottle!

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,540
Hurry, it's on!

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,770
You're embarrassing us all!

32
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,680
Hurry!

33
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,910
Faster!

34
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,430
Come on, the bomb shot!

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,280
Good!

36
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,940
Give me five.

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,280
Mr. Yang,

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,660
I didn't expect you to handle your drinks like that.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,690
Normally, we're not allowed to drink.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,710
But today,

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,010
I specifically applied for an exemption.

42
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,150
And I'm happy, so I had a couple more.

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,120
I've always felt

44
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,410
people with strong skills usually handle their liquor well too.

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,280
By the way,

46
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm really curious.

47
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,490
Can you tell me how you found out

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,140
there was something wrong with Moss Trading Group?

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,900
We worked with them for so long

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,560
but never suspected a thing.

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,310
I certainly can't tell you

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
anything too specific or detailed.

53
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,260
But I can tell you some simple

54
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,910
information that's already been made public.

55
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,840
I'm all ears.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,250
There is an old Chinese saying:

57
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,470
"No coincidence, no story."

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,470
But in our line of work,

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,930
too many coincidences mean

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
it's definitely not a coincidence.

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,240
You know what I mean?

62
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,900
What do you mean?

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Actually, from the very beginning,

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,120
the person I suspected the most...

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,710
was Alethea.

66
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,870
Because at that time,

67
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,960
she had the most contact

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,870
with people from the Moss Trading Group.

69
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,870
Later, through our investigation,

70
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,650
we found that she had nothing to do

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,190
with the Morse Trading Group espionage case.

72
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,920
And she personally provided us

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,120
with a lot of help.

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,750
Am I not supposed to be saying this?

75
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,950
It's fine, it's fine.

76
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,560
I apologized to you, right?

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,600
Then, Sander also

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,930
made a contribution

79
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,500
by letting you two get to know each other.

80
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
If you put it that way,

81
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,800
I guess you're right.

82
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,720
But those spies

83
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,600
are actually very cunning.

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,360
We found their traces

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
through Mr. Sun.

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Then we followed the clues

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,050
and eventually took them all down.

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,310
Mr. Yang,

89
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,400
if it weren't for your team,

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,030
we would've been caught up in the mess too.

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Could you tell us

92
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,830
how to identify spies?

93
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,290
Even if I told everyone here what to look for,

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,830
you still wouldn't be able to tell.

95
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,430
Because nowadays, spies

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
all have legal

97
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,310
and very proper cover identities.

98
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,790
Everything they do

99
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,470
is just like ordinary people.

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
You'd never suspect a thing.

101
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,390
But we,

102
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,950
after long-term tracking

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,810
and investigation,

104
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,560
can start to see

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
the hidden intentions

106
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
behind those "normal" actions.

107
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,120
Let's use Sander... Bowie as an example again.

108
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,830
The Moss Trading Group

109
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,830
didn't actually have the 4th-generation nuclear power technology,

110
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,780
yet they kept claiming they had it.

111
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,000
And they demanded a technology competition.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
After our investigation, we found out

113
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,159
they wanted to steal the technology

114
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,430
through that competition.

115
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,810
But I want to say,

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,260
don't reach out your hand.

117
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,360
You'll get caught if you do.

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Then, if we run into similar problems

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,920
or have doubts like that,

120
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,040
could you please help us

121
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,830
and identify whether they're a spy or not?

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,070
The way you put it,

123
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,330
I feel like one of those

124
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,340
antique authentication experts on livestreams.

125
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,070
Okay, okay.

126
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,920
If you ever

127
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,360
need anything,

128
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,910
you can have Alethea contact me directly.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,040
Okay!

130
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,250
Come on, friends.

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,690
Let's raise our glasses

132
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,210
to the guardians of our beautiful lives.

133
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,040
Y-Y-You all go ahead.

134
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,120
I really...

135
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,180
Don't leave, okay?

136
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,930
I just need to use the bathroom.

137
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,570
Don't leave.

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,750
Come on.

139
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,420
Mr. Yang.

140
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,480
Excuse me,

141
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
I need to take a call.

142
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,580
Back when we were in Capital City,

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,430
you didn't explain anything to me.

144
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,720
Explain what?

145
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,070
I didn't know anything.

146
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,750
I didn't know a thing,

147
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,000
so how was I supposed to cooperate with you?

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,950
What do you want?

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
I need to use the bathroom.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,930
I'll go with you.

151
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,940
I'll get nervous if you're with me.

152
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,750
Be careful, then.

153
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,900
At that time...

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,070
Wait for me.

155
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,170
Let me tell you,

156
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,000
at that time, we were in Capital City,

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,310
right?

158
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,830
Just stop already.

159
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,750
We had just arrived in a new place and didn't know anyone.

160
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,810
I haven't even asked you about the bugging devices yet.

161
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,750
Who is it?

162
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,800
Yang Guang, open the door.

163
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,680
Yang Guang!

164
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,310
Can't you just wait a moment?

165
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,000
No,

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
I need to use the bathroom.

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Hurry and open the door.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,630
No, no.

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,480
There's one on the second floor too.

170
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,240
Go upstairs

171
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,510
and turn left!

172
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
Will you ever dare to compete in drinking with Yang Guang again?

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,080
I drank too fast. I threw up everything.

174
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,680
Where's Mr. Yang Guang?

175
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,960
He went upstairs.

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,910
He's also throwing up.

177
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,400
I'll go check on him.

178
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,900
Yang Guang.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,550
Hurry up.

180
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,870
Come on, get up!

181
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,600
Are you okay?

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Get up, come on.

183
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,240
Get up.

184
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,300
Okay.

185
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,990
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

186
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,360
I'm okay.

187
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,110
Okay, okay.

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,270
Okay, okay.

189
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,510
Come on, Mr. Yang.

190
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,000
Zhao,

191
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,570
take him back to rest.

192
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,340
Let me take you to have a rest.

193
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,800
Come on.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,670
Okay.

195
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,400
Can you walk?

196
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,700
Slowly, be careful.

197
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,670
I need to rest.

198
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,400
Honey water.

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,240
Wake up.

200
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,410
Have some honey water.

201
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,030
I've called a taxi for you.

202
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,080
Go home and get some proper sleep later.

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,270
Just one sip, then.

204
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,250
Mr. Yang?

205
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,780
How do you feel now?

206
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,980
I'm okay.

207
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,750
Okay.

208
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,340
But...

209
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,550
I have to go to work

210
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,910
tomorrow morning.

211
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,440
So...

212
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
I have to go.

213
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,510
Okay.

214
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,320
Let's call it a night, then.

215
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,750
Let's get together another day.

216
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,120
Another day, then.

217
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,570
Come on, Zhao, help me...

218
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,150
see Mr. Yang off.

219
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,030
Bye-bye.

220
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,180
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

221
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,220
Bye-bye.

222
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,440
Be careful on the road.

223
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

224
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
Don't wander around like that in other people's homes.

225
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,060
Can you afford to pay if you break something?

226
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,680
I wasn't wandering around.

227
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,870
Taylor told me

228
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,310
to use the bathroom upstairs.

229
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,740
Go up...

230
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
and turn left.

231
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,790
Are you happy today?

232
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Are you happy?

233
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,850
If you're happy...

234
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,510
then I'm happy.

235
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,840
You're so cheesy.

236
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Get in the car.

237
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,350
Let me know when you get home.

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Okay.

239
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,820
Sir,

240
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,050
he's had a bit to drink.

241
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,790
Please drive slowly.

242
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,850
Okay, don't worry.

243
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,550
How was it?

244
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,890
Did you find anything?

245
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,360
I found this guy quite interesting.

246
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,550
We had a good time drinking.

247
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,280
After careful observation...

248
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,720
based on the microexpressions on his face,

249
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,250
I think there's no problem.

250
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,520
But I could tell

251
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,730
that he really likes Zhao.

252
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,910
Yet, I feel...

253
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
he doesn't waver easily.

254
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,480
He's gone.

255
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,720
Okay.

256
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,240
Sir, I'm a little drunk.

257
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,530
Please drive a little slower.

258
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,180
Okay.

259
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,130
Sir, could you do me a favor?

260
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,180
Sure, go ahead.

261
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,630
To be honest, I

262
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,180
actually have a second party to go to,

263
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,150
but...

264
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,840
You don't want your girlfriend to know, right?

265
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes.

266
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,870
But your girlfriend hailed the ride for you.

267
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,480
-Yes, yes.
-I understand.

268
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,980
How about this?

269
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,330
I'll drop you off

270
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,840
at the intersection ahead.

271
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,890
Thank you so much.

272
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,790
Don't mention it.

273
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,910
Then you can continue to follow the navigation.

274
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,080
Tell me

275
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,670
when you get to the destination.

276
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,120
Okay.

277
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,970
Should I add you on WeChat

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,030
or leave a number?

279
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll add you on WeChat in a bit.

280
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,790
I'll send you a tip later.

281
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,450
No need.

282
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,200
It's nothing.

283
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,840
Still.

284
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,240
Zhao.

285
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,800
I want to ask you.

286
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,380
Why were you walking so loudly

287
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,510
when you went upstairs just now?

288
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,110
Is there a problem with that?

289
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,010
If he'd been doing something at that moment,

290
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,280
the noise would have been the best warning for him.

291
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,440
You suspect me?

292
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,690
You suspect that I've been turned by Yang Guang,

293
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,320
and I was just warning him?

294
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,120
Did you?

295
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,480
Did I?

296
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,720
Of...

297
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,960
of course not.

298
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,750
J,

299
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
you'd better show me

300
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,360
how to walk in high heels without making any sound.

301
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,120
Let's see if you can do it.

302
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,120
I was just worried something might happen to him.

303
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,670
That's why I rushed,

304
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,910
that's all.

305
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,120
Yet you suspect me.

306
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,440
You know that.

307
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
I've never suspected you.

308
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,000
Really?

309
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,610
You've never suspected me?

310
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,360
You never suspected me,

311
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,100
yet in Capital City,

312
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,150
you had Taylor and the others secretly

313
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,670
plant bugs in Yang Guang's room without telling me.

314
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,510
I trust you,

315
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,710
but I don't trust him.

316
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,030
Fine, then.

317
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,870
I request to officially withdraw

318
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,130
from this mission starting today, okay?

319
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,200
You secured our contracts with Huaze and Taiyu.

320
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,240
The next phase of the mission is about to start.

321
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,250
You can't leave.

322
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,270
I can't leave.

323
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,880
If I don't leave, what do you want me to do?

324
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
I've followed your instructions

325
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,670
step by step.

326
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,880
I've done my best

327
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,590
to complete every task you've assigned to me.

328
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,840
And in the end, all I get in return is your suspicion.

329
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,720
If you were me,

330
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
what would you think?

331
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,000
I just want to remind you

332
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,510
to never forget who you are at any time.

333
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,109
I told you when you first

334
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,569
joined the organization:

335
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,680
being swayed by emotions is taboo.

336
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,310
To be honest,

337
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,550
I've really been

338
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,819
a bit concerned about you lately.

339
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
About what?

340
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,110
I trained you myself.

341
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,960
I know you're the most excellent agent.

342
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,290
But people have emotions.

343
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,210
Yang Guang saved your life.

344
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,720
It's natural for you to develop

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,930
some feelings for him.

346
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,970
You also believe

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,060
that you can control those emotions.

348
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,720
But in the history of espionage,

349
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,810
there are countless cases where fake feelings became real.

350
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,790
So,

351
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,960
I want to remind you sincerely.

352
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,160
You must put the bigger picture first.

353
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,240
You must not fall into emotional entanglements.

354
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,750
I know.

355
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,750
But Yang Guang is also an elite agent.

356
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,070
If I act in front of him,

357
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,070
there's a high risk I'll be exposed.

358
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,230
Only sincerity

359
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,370
is the best weapon to deal with him.

360
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,230
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

361
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,640
Fine.

362
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,070
I'll give you four options:

363
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,400
First,

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
maintain the status quo.

365
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,160
Second, I'll ignore him.

366
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,460
Third, completely win him over.

367
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,750
Fourth, kill him.

368
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,350
Make your choice.

369
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,920
Once you've decided,

370
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,590
tell me,

371
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,320
and I'll execute it for you.

372
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,400
I need to

373
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,200
check with the boss first.

374
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,880
Hello, who ordered a designated driver?

375
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,400
Hello, the last four digits are 3233. Thank you.

376
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,830
Okay.

377
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,350
[I'm on my way home]

378
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,350
That's the situation.

379
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm very worried about Zhao.

380
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,420
This is not my concern.

381
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,200
I only care about the result.

382
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,000
Ask Zhao to get him.

383
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,400
She's never liked this tactic.

384
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,830
Now,

385
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,070
making her sacrifice like this...

386
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm very worried.

387
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,790
J, you know our plans.

388
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,270
Sacrifices will be worthwhile.

389
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,790
This is a critical point,

390
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,680
and we need to determine

391
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,270
if she's an enemy or an ally.

392
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,550
If she fails...

393
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,310
Then, she's no longer our ally,

394
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,680
but an enemy to be eliminated.

395
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,830
The top priority now

396
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
is receiving the package.

397
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,280
Three pieces of equipment are already on the way,

398
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,070
and I've adjusted the delivery method.

399
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,030
Why?

400
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,160
I've already prepared.

401
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,160
It's too risky to use the same method.

402
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,070
The three items will now be transported separately

403
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,000
by air, sea,

404
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,440
and land.

405
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,070
I'll send you the pick-up locations

406
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,000
by encrypted email.

407
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,750
I'll come up with a new plan.

408
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,790
You got the gift?

409
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,590
I got it.

410
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,300
I've hidden it in a safe place.

411
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,920
No one will ever find it.

412
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Good.

413
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,950
It will be very helpful in critical moments.

414
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,850
Okay, Boss.

415
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,160
Okay.

416
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,480
I'll be ready to receive the package.

417
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,630
Good night, Boss.

418
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,270
J, what's wrong?

419
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
What is Yang Guang doing?

420
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,750
It shows he arrived home 15 minutes ago.

421
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,270
He was pretty drunk.

422
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,240
He should be sleeping at home now.

423
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,370
Go to his home immediately to confirm.

424
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,120
Something happened?

425
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,040
I suspect that someone has sneaked into my house.

426
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
You suspect it's Yang Guang?

427
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,340
At least, we need to rule him out as a suspect.

428
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:11,930
J, I...

429
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,200
I really think you're being way too paranoid.

430
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Listen to me.

431
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,400
Go there now and check.

432
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,000
Also,

433
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,750
about the choice you asked me to make,

434
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,350
I'll tell you my answer now.

435
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,670
I'll give you one week.

436
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,030
Completely win him over.

437
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,840
Why do you always ask me to seduce Yang Guang?

438
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,240
What do you take me for?

439
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,570
I don't like doing this!

440
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,510
Because you are the most familiar with him.

441
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,310
Only you can complete this task.

442
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,970
You're really strange today.

443
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,930
Why are you asking this question?

444
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,510
Didn't you say you would do whatever it takes

445
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,910
to complete the mission?

446
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,440
[File transfer in progress]

447
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,480
Okay, I'll be ready to receive the package.

448
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,030
Okay, I'll be ready to receive the package.

449
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:37,080
[Find a way to tail Yang Guang tomorrow.
See where he goes and whom he meets.]

450
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:44,290
[I was just about to tell you. They've completely uncovered my identity.
I'm being closely watched now. I can't move.]

451
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,370
[I trust your abilities. Don't let me down. Think about your future together.
The immigration process is underway.]

452
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,630
[But I don't even know where Yang Guang will be tomorrow.
How can I follow him?]

453
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,550
[I'll tell you his location tomorrow morning.]

454
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,310
[Okay.]

455
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,270
Drive.

456
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,250
Shoot, let's go.

457
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,230
Hey, Boss, I've arrived.

458
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,850
Zhao is here too.

459
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,360
Keep an eye on them.

460
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,699
Got it.

461
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:57,200
[Besides watching Zhao Yaning, you also need to keep watching Yang Guang.
As soon as he leaves tomorrow, notify me immediately.]

462
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,360
[Yang Guang]

463
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,280
Yang Guang?

464
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,400
Yang Guang!

465
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,000
[Confirmed. Yang Guang is at home.]

466
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,190
[I called him from outside his apartment. I can hear his phone ringing,
but he's not answering.]

467
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,070
[He passed out drunk, sleeping heavily.]

468
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,920
[You must see him in person]

469
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,160
Yang Guang?

470
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,630
Yang Guang?

471
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,030
Xiaoman,

472
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,860
give me your building management's number.

473
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,440
Yang Guang drank too much tonight.

474
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,150
I'm worried,

475
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,480
so I came to check on him.

476
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,320
I'm outside his door now.

477
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,130
I can hear his phone ringing inside,

478
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,460
but he's not answering.

479
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,400
I'm worried about him.

480
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,280
But getting the building management's number won't help.

481
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,320
They can't open his door either.

482
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,100
Okay, I'll try calling him a few more times.

483
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,630
If he still doesn't answer,

484
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
I'll have to call the police.

485
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,510
Hello?

486
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,840
Are you okay?

487
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,480
I'm fine.

488
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,480
Don't worry.

489
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,840
Why didn't you answer my call?

490
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,960
I fell asleep.

491
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,960
I didn't hear it.

492
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,210
My phone wasn't near me.

493
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,350
I brought over the hangover soup I made.

494
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,670
No need, no need, no need.

495
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,870
Don't worry about me.

496
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,270
I'm right outside your door.

497
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,190
Open up.

498
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,840
Okay.

499
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,360
Hi.

500
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,480
Come in.

501
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,770
Where's the light?

502
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Turn on the light.

503
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,410
Drink the soup.

504
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,620
Thank you.

505
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,230
Your place is so messy.

506
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,000
When was the last time you did your laundry?

507
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,070
Don't worry about it.

508
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,200
I'll wash it myself tomorrow morning.

509
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,050
Just leave it alone, okay?

510
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,080
How did the coat end up like this?

511
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,400
How did you...

512
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,150
how did you mess up my coat like this?

513
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,150
How can I wear it again?

514
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,480
I really drank too much tonight.

515
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,510
I haven't drunk like that for a long time.

516
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,670
I blacked out.

517
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,060
When I got home, the taxi driver

518
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,370
had to yell at me for ages to wake me up.

519
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,030
I can't drink like that anymore.

520
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,960
I really shouldn't drink like that again.

521
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
You drank so much,

522
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,400
yet you still knew to put your clothes in the washing machine.

523
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,600
It's precisely because I drank too much

524
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,380
that I put my clothes in the washing machine.

525
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,150
You see? I normally don't do that.

526
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,150
Please, just leave it alone, okay?

527
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,510
I'm begging you.

528
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,170
Just go home and get some sleep, okay?

529
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,180
I'll go after the laundry is done.

530
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,630
You didn't throw up in the bedroom, did you?

531
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,150
No, I don't think so.
