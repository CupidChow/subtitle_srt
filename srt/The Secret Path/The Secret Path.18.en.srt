[Duty of the Reporter: Yang Guang]

4
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,890
I want to ask you something.

5
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,750
You've always trusted me,

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,850
haven't you?

7
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,140
I trust the facts.

8
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,630
I trust the evidence.

9
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,870
If the facts and evidence

10
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,040
prove that you're a good person,

11
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,090
then why wouldn't I trust you?

12
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,780
If the facts and evidence

13
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,430
can't prove that,

14
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,340
would you still trust me?

15
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,290
If the facts and evidence

16
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
can't prove that,

17
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,960
should I still trust you?

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,590
I hope you can trust me.

19
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,350
Son,

20
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,430
dinner's ready.

21
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,310
Let's eat.

22
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,560
Coming.

23
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Your stir-fried eggplant is quite good today.

24
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,040
Son,

25
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,269
you went abroad without a word,

26
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,750
and came back just as quietly.

27
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,950
W-What have you been up to?

28
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,040
Don't mind your mom.

29
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,600
She doesn't understand the principle of confidentiality at all.

30
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,950
Always asking questions.

31
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,080
Look at your old man,

32
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,630
right?

33
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,440
I understand perfectly.

34
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,760
National secrets.

35
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,870
We both know without saying.

36
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,420
Right?

37
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,510
Your awareness and insight are truly impressive.

38
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,420
Of course.

39
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,750
Son,

40
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,360
have you

41
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,810
recently

42
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,900
met any

43
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,600
new friends?

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,930
What kind of friends are you referring to?

45
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
I mean

46
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,120
a girlfriend, of course.

47
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,260
Can you not be so nosy?

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,990
I finally get to come home for a meal,

49
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,160
can't you let me have some peace and quiet?

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Don't make every meal at home feel like an interrogation.

51
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,710
Alright, alright. Go ahead and eat.

52
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,380
You.

53
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,400
You have to understand

54
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,740
your parents'

55
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,950
feelings.

56
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,800
Right?

57
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,600
I understand.

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,000
Here’s

59
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,730
a toast to you.

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,410
Okay.

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,180
Cheers.

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,070
Drinking water instead of wine.

63
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,360
Come on,

64
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,070
Son, hurry up.

65
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,830
Eat.

66
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,580
Alright, thank you, thank you.

67
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,870
Relax.

68
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,040
It's not you they are targeting,

69
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,430
it's me.

70
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I know you're nervous right now.

71
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,150
But I need to tell you,

72
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,680
I've been hanging around this grey area

73
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,830
for many years.

74
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,270
It's a dangerous game,

75
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,390
but I can protect your safety

76
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,420
to the greatest extent possible.

77
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,830
Don't be nervous.

78
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,000
Just get to the point.

79
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,680
I hope

80
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,659
you can find an opportunity to keep an eye on Yang Guang.

81
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,159
Li Jian from State Security

82
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,870
is already approaching and probing me.

83
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,510
Yang Guang discovering my true identity

84
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,840
is just a matter of time.

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
Now you want me to follow Yang Guang.

86
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,380
Are you hoping for me to get into trouble?

87
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,720
We're in the same boat.

88
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,440
Would there be any good if you were exposed?

89
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,310
You won't get into trouble

90
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,850
because you have Xie Xiaoman.

91
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,800
She's the best cover.

92
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,100
Even though they've got their eyes on you,

93
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,960
there's no evidence against you.

94
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,720
Otherwise,

95
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,850
they would have arrested you already.

96
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,550
You can move around freely without any issues.

97
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,920
What Yang Guang and his people are paying attention to

98
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,360
is our side,

99
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,470
not you.

100
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,360
So,

101
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,320
you are the perfect one

102
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,450
to keep an eye on him.

103
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,250
What about the things I asked for?

104
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Where's the money and passport?

105
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,790
I've done so much for you,

106
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,240
but up until now,

107
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,380
I haven't received anything.

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,750
The account was already opened a long time ago.

109
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
The first payment

110
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,720
has been transferred to the account.

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,920
After the job is done,

112
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll transfer all the money to your account.

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,060
The passport is being processed.

114
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,960
We are sincere

115
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,360
with our friends.

116
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,950
I need to get a passport for one more person.

117
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,730
I want to take Xie Xiaoman with me.

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,410
Have you fallen in love?

119
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,750
She's just my cover.

120
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,840
Alright,

121
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,440
I promise you.

122
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,990
After the job is done,

123
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
I'll send both of you abroad.

124
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,120
As for Yang Guang,

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,540
although it's difficult,

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,790
I'll find a way.

127
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,910
During your business trip,

128
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,810
we made significant progress.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,510
Our prime suspect is most likely

130
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
that foreign writer, Luca Mori.

131
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,660
Luca Mori?

132
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,650
So, you’re saying he’s the one who got away?

133
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,600
It's very possible.

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,970
We've looked into his identity as a writer,

135
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,910
and it's very suspicious.

136
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,080
We all suspect that

137
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Hermes

138
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,010
created a fake identity for him.

139
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,750
He was also

140
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,550
on the list of sixteen suspects,

141
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,150
but he's not directly involved in the main event

142
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,340
and often has solid alibis.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
So we let him off the hook.

144
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,240
And do you know what else?

145
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,550
Xie Xiaoman is actually dating him now.

146
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,790
I know.

147
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,910
When did you find out?

148
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,510
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,820
Is Xie Xiaoman's relationship with Luca Mori

150
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,020
relevant to all this?

151
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,630
We can't be sure,

152
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
so we need to investigate.

153
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,870
Yesterday,

154
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,000
I went to the court to find Xie Xiaoman.

155
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,390
I had just started talking to her,

156
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,270
Luca Mori came to pick her up.

157
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,770
I couldn't get any information out of her.

158
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,610
What was your excuse for going there?

159
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,360
Playing badminton,

160
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,220
a coincidence.

161
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,470
That straightforward?

162
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,140
What else could I do?

163
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,870
That could risk alerting them.

164
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,990
It's okay.

165
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,690
Let's try to find a way to smooth things over.

166
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,670
Xiaoman,

167
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,150
I heard from Li Jian at work

168
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,510
that you two met yesterday.

169
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,200
How have you been lately?

170
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,530
Is everything alright?

171
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,350
Everything's great.

172
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,560
Have you finished dealing with all your troubles?

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,130
Yes, it's all taken care of.

174
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,540
Are you free today?

175
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
I got

176
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,510
a box of

177
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,240
Chaoyue's limited edition shuttlecocks from Chen.

178
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,550
The quality is very good.

179
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,920
Let me bring them over to you.

180
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,010
Consider it a housewarming gift.

181
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,060
When are you coming over?

182
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,680
I'll send you my new address.

183
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm coming right now.

184
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,930
See you soon.

185
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,100
Take care of yourself.

186
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,660
Mr. Nice Guy.

187
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,360
Yang.

188
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,430
Hi.

189
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,610
Long time no see.

190
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,570
Long time no see.

191
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,240
The slippers are ready for you.

192
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,630
Congratulations on your new home.

193
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,840
Thank you.

194
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,270
Mr. Yang.

195
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:18,750
Hi.

196
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,870
We meet again.

197
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,800
Welcome.

198
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,480
Excuse me for the inconvenience.

199
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
No problem.

200
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,650
I hope I'm not causing you any trouble.

201
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,450
What trouble?

202
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,550
It's no trouble at all.

203
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,150
Don't just stand there.

204
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,870
Please, have a seat.

205
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,200
Okay.

206
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,120
Here,

207
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,760
let me get you some water.

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,510
Yang,

209
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,000
are you still single?

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,460
Haven't you made any progress with Ms. Zhao?

211
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,030
Not as fast as you guys.

212
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,120
We're just

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,560
friends now.

214
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,630
We'll...

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,530
We'll see what happens.

216
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, you should put in more effort

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,260
and try to win her over.

218
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,840
I mean, Ms. Zhao is beautiful,

219
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,840
has a great job,

220
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,000
and is very capable.

221
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,510
It's difficult to find someone like her.

222
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,080
Can you stop being so nosy?

223
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,600
Have some fruit.

224
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:56,870
Okay.

225
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,670
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

226
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,720
Mr. Yang.

227
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,270
What do you do for a living?

228
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,440
Haven't I been introduced?

229
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,150
Am I that unimportant?

230
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,210
I just run a small company.

231
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,380
Oh, you run a company?

232
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,880
Where is it located?

233
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,750
Can you tell me more about it?

234
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
Maybe we could

235
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,860
collaborate in the future.

236
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,070
It's in Yanping,

237
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,160
a trading company.

238
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,460
If you ask what exactly we do,

239
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,150
we do whatever makes money.

240
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,750
Just trying to make a living.

241
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,860
Bur currently, our company's

242
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,410
scope of business

243
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,540
doesn't include culture and book publishing.

244
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,770
So for the time being,

245
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,750
we may not have any chance to collaborate with you.

246
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,300
It's alright, it's alright.

247
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,850
Just because we can't collaborate now

248
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,480
doesn't mean

249
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,790
we can't in the future, right?

250
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,190
I like what you just said.

251
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,720
If there are any good opportunities in the future,

252
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,000
we can make money together.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,730
Of course, that would be great.

254
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,740
How is it?

255
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,260
A small study room for the two of us.

256
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,210
The style is indeed

257
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,900
quite different from before.

258
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,200
How cozy it is!

259
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,340
Don't you think it's cozy?

260
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,960
Cozy, cozy.

261
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,070
As long as you think it's cozy, that's good.

262
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,000
Is this the racket I gave you?

263
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,960
Yes, it is.

264
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,820
The strings are all tightened?

265
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,410
I'm telling you, this is really good.

266
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,170
Thank you.

267
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
Have you played with it?

268
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,840
What a pity.

269
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,100
I've only played once.

270
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,550
Yang, let's go play badminton next time.

271
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,310
That would require your dear one's approval.

272
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,840
I have the final say on this.

273
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,910
You two have been to quite a few places, huh?

274
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,480
How is it?

275
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,390
It's really nice, right?

276
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,850
Mm-hmm.

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,910
Where was this taken?

278
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,910
That's Baihua Mountain.

279
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,390
When Luca and I went out together,

280
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,320
he took it for me.

281
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,580
Is it the Baihua Mountain here in Yanping?

282
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,100
Yes.

283
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,370
Have you been there?

284
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,670
I have.

285
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,770
But I didn't think it was this beautiful.

286
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,160
I guess I went at the wrong time.

287
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,420
When did you two go?

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
I remember it clearly.

289
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,830
May 29th.

290
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,870
It was our

291
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,320
first vacation

292
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,180
after we became official.

293
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,400
Hopeless romantic.

294
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,480
Single dog.

295
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,400
That's nice.

296
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,280
That's nice.

297
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,750
Your strings are well-strung.

298
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,880
I need to take a photo to remember this.

299
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,790
I'll send you

300
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,750
the merchant's WeChat contact.

301
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,960
Great. Send it to me.

302
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,670
No problem.

303
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,090
Sounds good.

304
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
The meal is ready.

305
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,140
Yang, let's go.

306
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,300
Let me tell you,

307
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,650
the sushi made by Luca

308
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,750
is really delicious.

309
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,200
It seems

310
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,510
I won't have the fortune for that today.

311
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,390
Why?

312
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,870
I have to leave now.

313
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,790
Why didn't you say so earlier?

314
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,480
I'm really sorry.

315
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,880
What's wrong?

316
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,320
Well...

317
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,000
I had already planned to meet a friend

318
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,970
for lunch today,

319
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,790
so it's a bit too late to cancel.

320
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,250
I'm truly sorry.

321
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,280
Another day!

322
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,630
I'll definitely

323
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,440
come by another day

324
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,900
to try Mr. Luca's cooking.

325
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,360
Alright, I forgive you.

326
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,300
I'll walk you out then.

327
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,630
Okay, bye-bye.

328
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,610
Goodbye.

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
You're in such a hurry,

330
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,200
leaving already.

331
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,390
Well, I know where you live.

332
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,850
I'll come again next time.

333
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,930
Alright then.

334
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,390
Take it easy on the road.

335
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,510
Okay.

336
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
Be safe.

337
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,450
Bye.

338
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,010
Bye-bye.

339
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
Let's eat then.

340
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,740
[Li Jian]

341
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,360
Hello.

342
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,450
In twenty minutes,

343
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,310
team meeting.

344
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,160
Division Director Yang,

345
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,550
the background check on Xie Xiaoman has been completed.

346
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,480
Xie Xiaoman is a native of Yanping.

347
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,800
She's an only child.

348
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Her father, Xie Guangshen, works in logistics at No. 2 Nuclear Research Lab,

349
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,480
where he led a fleet that transported canteen supplies.

350
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,200
Her mother, Song Changshun, is an ordinary housewife.

351
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,920
It's the No. 2 Nuclear Research Lab again.

352
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,030
Luca must be going after

353
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,240
Xie Xiaoman's father,

354
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,440
and is just using Xie Xiaoman as a cover.

355
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,230
We need to find evidence.

356
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,150
It's now almost certain that

357
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,480
Luca Mori

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,250
is the missing piece

359
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
we've been searching for

360
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,400
all along.

361
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,109
All his alibis

362
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,960
were fabricated through

363
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
his relationship

364
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
with Xie Xiaoman

365
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,880
and her translation work.

366
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
May 30th is the day

367
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,030
the No. 2 Nuclear Research Lab had the incident.

368
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,830
Just the day before, on May 29th,

369
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Luca Mori and Xie Xiaoman

370
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,880
visited Baihua Valley,

371
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,640
where the No. 2 Nuclear Research Lab is located,

372
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,300
under the guise of a vacation.

373
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,620
I don't think this is just a coincidence.

374
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,480
So I've decided

375
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,000
to initiate full monitoring

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,880
of Luca Mori

377
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,480
starting now.

378
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,200
The Operations Section

379
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
will be keeping Luca Mori

380
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,820
under 24-hour surveillance.

381
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,680
Understood.

382
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,480
Section Chief Chen,

383
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
you'll work with Section Chief Li

384
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,550
to provide technical support.

385
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,270
Understood.

386
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,670
Ms. Ma,

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,800
you lead a team

388
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,250
to conduct a full review

389
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,680
of previous cases,

390
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,750
with Luca Mori

391
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,680
considered as a suspect.

392
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,160
I need a detailed and clear

393
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,620
timeline and trajectory.

394
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,450
Understood.

395
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,640
While I was away these past few days,

396
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,840
you all worked so hard

397
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,510
and achieved a lot.

398
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,420
But Luca Mori has been hiding for too long.

399
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,350
We need to find evidence immediately

400
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,480
to arrest him and bring him to justice.

401
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
You startled me.

402
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,730
Why are you standing here?

403
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
When I was cooking just now,

404
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,040
you seemed to be having a nice chat with Yang Guang.

405
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
What were you talking about?

406
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,250
Were you talking about me?

407
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,300
Yes,

408
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,290
we were talking about you.

409
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,310
He's worried you'll treat me poorly

410
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,550
and might bully me.

411
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,270
Is that all?

412
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,550
Nothing else?

413
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,310
No.

414
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,190
He's such a curious person.

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
He didn't even ask about my book,

416
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,690
nor did he ask about your work?

417
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,920
For no reason at all,

418
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,680
why did he come to see you?

419
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,770
Did he spend a long time asking questions

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,930
about our trip to Baihua Mountain?

421
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,470
What did you tell him?

422
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,960
Why do you have so many questions?

423
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,270
The photos are right there.

424
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,160
It's his mouth,

425
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,840
how can I stop him from asking whatever he wants?

426
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,590
Why have you suddenly become so weird?

427
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,200
I can hardly recognize you.

428
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,720
Did he ask you about

429
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,610
that photo from Baihua Mountain?

430
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,820
Yes.

431
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,110
He did ask.

432
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,030
He asked me where it was taken

433
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,230
and when it was taken.

434
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,640
I told him everything.

435
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
I said it was in Baihua Mountain area.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,920
On May 29th.

437
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,110
The photo was from our first outing together.

438
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,830
That's all.

439
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,180
Are you satisfied now?

440
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,550
Luca,

441
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,720
I've always known you well.

442
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,920
I trust you too.

443
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,110
But sometimes,

444
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,040
I feel like you're a bit different.

445
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,750
What's wrong?

446
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,060
I'm sorry, Xiaoman.

447
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm just...

448
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,320
I care about you too much.

449
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,590
I don't like others

450
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,200
interfering with our life.

451
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,110
From now on,

452
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,750
don't let Yang Guang and his people

453
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,150
come to our home anymore.

454
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,970
Is that okay?

455
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,830
Alright.

456
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,830
If you really don't like it,

457
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,560
I won't bring him here anymore.

458
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,290
Division Director Yang.

459
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,700
[Are you busy?]

460
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,860
[No. Why?]

461
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,380
[Let's meet]

462
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,070
This coffee tastes better than the one at the airport.

463
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,070
Of course it does.

464
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,320
What do you mean "of course"?

465
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,750
Don't give me that half-smile

466
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,400
while staring at me.

467
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
It's making me nervous.

468
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,480
If you have something to say, just say it, will you?

469
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,280
I need a favor.

470
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,350
What kind of favor?

471
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,440
It's not going to be as exciting as Capital City, is it?

472
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,400
If it's that kind of thing again,

473
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,880
we should just call the police. I really can't help you with that.

474
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,790
It's much more comfortable than that.

475
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,980
Just eating, drinking, and chatting, that's all.

476
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,210
Well, you need to be clear with me.

477
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,160
Who are we eating with?

478
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,680
Who are we drinking with? Who are we chatting with?

479
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,590
Don't spring any surprises on me again.

480
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,320
With my boss.

481
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,610
At my boss's house.

482
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,840
Taylor and Li Taiheng will be there too.

483
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,790
With that...

484
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,190
Right.

485
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,030
No.

486
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,640
Isn't that an internal gathering of your company?

487
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,700
It wouldn't be right for an outsider like me to go.

488
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,500
I want you

489
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,150
to go with me as my date.

490
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,070
That's such a big favor.

491
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,440
Let's just call the police, okay?

492
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
I just think you're the perfect fit.

493
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,900
Am I?

494
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,750
Do you want to give me some training in advance?

495
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,100
What should I pay attention to as your date?

496
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,400
Just change your clothes, that's all.

497
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Is it that simple?

498
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,310
Okay.

499
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,980
It's settled then.

500
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,070
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

501
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:00,960
Alright.

502
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,920
I think you can go.

503
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,200
This is a good opportunity to know Leader.

504
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,320
Don't worry, just go.

505
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,120
I approve.

506
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,660
I have two small requests.

507
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,590
Go on.

508
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,830
First, I'll have to drink some alcohol.

509
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,320
You can't count that as a disciplinary violation.

510
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,760
It's work, no problem.

511
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,480
But you must drink moderately.

512
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,210
Understood.

513
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,750
The second request is that

514
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,480
I want some new tech equipment.

515
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,110
We'll probably talk about

516
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,760
the nuclear power collaboration.

517
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,790
I want to record it.

518
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,320
Alright.

519
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,130
I approve that too.

520
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,130
Thank you, sir.

521
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,750
As what I always said,

522
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,010
know your boundaries.

523
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,710
Division Director Yang.

524
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
What kind of great stuff is this?

525
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,900
Take a look.

526
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,820
That's the remedy for hangovers.

527
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,920
It's specially made

528
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,640
and has certain detox effects.

529
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,850
If you drink too much,

530
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
it will help you feel more comfortable.

531
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,260
Okay.

532
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,340
The other one is a smart watch.

533
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,760
This smart watch

534
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,590
can record audio and video.

535
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,010
It can also block and disable cameras.

536
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,890
Moreover,

537
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,280
it includes an unlocking feature.

538
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,830
Regular password doors and locks

539
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,020
can be easily unlocked.

540
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,880
I don't remember

541
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,270
our division having these things.

542
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,330
This is newly provided by the bureau.

543
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,730
Here.

544
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,700
Division Director Yang, please sign here.

545
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,230
Alright.

546
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,310
Although they've got their eyes on you,

547
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,830
they have no evidence.

548
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,020
Otherwise,

549
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,090
they would have arrested you already.

550
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,000
You can move around freely without any issues.

551
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,040
Darling,

552
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,920
are you done?

553
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,640
Not yet.

554
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,110
How about you?

555
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,680
Have you finished the manuscript?

556
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,750
I've just finished all four chapters.

557
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,160
I've sent them to your email.

558
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,920
Take a look.

559
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,600
Okay, I'll check it now.

560
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,570
Darling.

561
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,790
Have you heard from the publishers?

562
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,110
Have you decided which one to work with?

563
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,050
I haven't decided yet.

564
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,110
What's wrong?

565
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,680
It's nothing.

566
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,080
I just can't wait

567
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,140
to see your book published in China

568
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,950
and reaching more readers.

569
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,730
Alright.

570
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,290
I'm going to the library now

571
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,880
to properly

572
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,920
and quietly appreciate your work.

573
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,180
Then let me go with you.

574
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,480
No need.

575
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,670
You should rest well at home.

576
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,750
I'll be more focused if I read alone.

577
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,830
Also, I'm going to do some research

578
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,490
to prepare for the next novel.

579
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,240
Okay.

580
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,070
I'll wait for your feedback.

581
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,720
Sure.

582
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,200
Thank you for your hard work, darling.

583
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,440
Everyone, pay attention!

584
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,840
The target has appeared.

585
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,030
Make sure to stay on top of him.

586
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,590
Roger that.

587
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,250
Roger that.

588
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,080
Understood.

589
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
Zhang Lei, Wang Hong,

590
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,640
you two follow him first.

591
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,100
Keep a good distance.

592
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,000
Alright, alright.

593
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,530
Let's go.

594
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,690
Let's go.

595
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,030
Section Chief Li, it's been half a day already.

596
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,920
He doesn't seem like he's planning to leave at all.

597
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,400
He can't really be here just to read books, can he?

598
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,200
You guys go ahead and have lunch.

599
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,030
Tan and I will keep an eye on him.

600
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,510
Come back quickly after you finish eating to switch with us.

601
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,910
Then we'll make it quick.

602
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,640
Hi.

603
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,000
Hi.

604
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,200
Good afternoon.

605
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,360
Good afternoon.

606
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,270
Please get in the car, sir.

607
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,070
That's not appropriate.

608
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,680
I look more like a driver in these clothes.

609
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,210
Please get in the car, miss.

610
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,740
To be honest,

611
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,290
I really didn't expect

612
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,020
you to dress so formally today.

613
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,370
Am I

614
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,500
dressed too casually in comparison?

615
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,550
Not at all.

616
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,530
It's just a family dinner.

617
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,550
It's a family dinner for you,

618
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,440
but for me,

619
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,750
it's my first visit

620
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,480
to a stranger's home.

621
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
How can it be the same?

622
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,110
Could you give me a quick introduction

623
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,160
on what your boss,

624
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,590
James, is like,

625
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
so I don't say anything wrong later?

626
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,960
I've told you before, haven't I?

627
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,030
He's my guide in public relations,

628
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,350
so he's like my mentor.

629
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,550
You don't need to be nervous.

630
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,880
He's a very nice person.

631
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,960
Okay.

632
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,680
His relationship with me is like

633
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,960
a friend,

634
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,270
an older brother,

635
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,070
and a father.

636
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,310
No, no, that's not right.

637
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,170
Let me tell you,

638
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,520
with his fussy nature,

639
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,880
he's more like a mother.

640
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,590
Then this person is quite complex,

641
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,920
both a father and a mother at the same time.

642
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,660
Do you often get together?

643
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,730
A few times a year, I guess.

644
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,930
That's nice.

645
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,170
You PR people really live a carefree life.

646
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,090
I'm so envious.

647
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,800
Taiheng.

648
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,290
Taylor.

649
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,730
Today's cocktail party

650
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,270
has only one purpose,

651
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,400
to check out Zhao's boyfriend.

652
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,480
This guy is really something.

653
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,390
All afternoon,

654
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,400
he hasn't done anything

655
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,460
except read books.

656
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,030
Yeah,

657
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,900
this guy really has patience.

658
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,120
It's a battle of endurance,

659
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,410
just hang in there.

660
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,060
Let's see who can hold out longer.

661
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,920
You're back.

662
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,510
I'm back.

663
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,080
Darling,

664
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,550
how's it?

665
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,790
I feel very good.

666
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,070
This final draft

667
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,900
really captures

668
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,170
everything I wanted to express

669
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,580
in "Embrace".

670
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,750
I've already started contacting publishers.

671
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,110
That's great!

672
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,750
You're not just being polite with me, are you?

673
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,060
Of course not.

674
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,830
This is work,

675
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,510
and I have to approach it

676
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,310
with the greatest seriousness.

677
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,370
So, which publisher have you contacted?

678
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,280
Sanyang Publishing House.

679
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,350
Have they replied?

680
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,910
When will it be published?

681
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,310
How many copies for the first print?

682
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,370
The plans hasn't been finalized yet,

683
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,750
but I'll tell you as soon as it's decided.

684
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,530
Alright.

685
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,500
I'm so excited!

686
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,750
Darling,

687
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,370
I have another idea.

688
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,920
Go on.

689
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,659
After this book is published,

690
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,179
for the next book,

691
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,190
I want to write it in America.

692
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,199
Why go that far?

693
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,870
I want to write a story

694
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,420
about Asian people in the U.S.

695
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,710
I hope you'll come with me

696
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,920
to experience

697
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,960
the local culture and real stories.

698
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,400
We'll create a work

699
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,710
that belongs to both of us.

700
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,320
Although it's sudden,

701
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,800
but

702
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,900
I'm willing to go with you.

703
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,719
Wherever you go, I'll go.

704
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,310
He lives in such a large villa by himself.

705
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,000
He likes to be alone.

706
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,160
The lady who cooks and cleans

707
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,590
usually leaves after completing her work.

708
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Zhao.

709
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,000
This is our hero,

710
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,690
Mr. Yang Guang, I presume?

711
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,320
Yes.

712
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,460
Yang Guang, let me introduce you.

713
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,280
This is the one I've been telling you about,

714
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
my boss, James.

715
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,710
I've heard so much about you.

716
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,760
It's a pleasure to meet you.

717
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,890
Pleased to meet you.

718
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,720
As it's my first visit,

719
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,920
I wasn't sure what you'd like,

720
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,520
so I brought a bottle of wine.

721
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,200
Thank you, thank you.

722
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,410
I've often heard Zhao mention you.

723
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,240
Finally meeting you today.

724
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,670
You're indeed as talented as described.

725
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,370
No, no,

726
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,040
I'm just an ordinary person.

727
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,530
Although we didn't know each other before,

728
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,640
there's no need

729
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,990
to be humble with me.

730
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,610
This trip to Capital City,

731
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,280
Zhao's success wouldn't have been possible

732
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,000
without Mr. Yang's help.

733
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,880
We must have a proper drink later.

734
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,440
Sure, let's have a drink.

735
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,400
Come, please.

736
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,760
Where should I sit?

737
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,360
Sit inside.

738
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,690
Here?

739
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,150
Okay.

740
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,220
Let's raise our glasses together.

741
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,270
Welcome Mr. Yang Guang to our humble abode.

742
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,210
At the same time,

743
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,240
congratulations to Zhao and Mr. Yang

744
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,440
for returning safely from Capital City.

745
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,920
And we thank Mr. Yang

746
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,670
for his care of Zhao

747
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
and his support in helping Leader.

748
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,880
There's an old Chinese saying,

749
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,400
"When the feelings are deep,

750
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,660
drink it all in one go."

751
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

752
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

753
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,280
Come, everyone, enjoy the food.

754
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,710
Okay.

755
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,070
Thank you.

756
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,290
I really didn't expect that

757
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,700
your Chinese is so good

758
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,070
and so authentic.

759
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,100
So, it seems that

760
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,030
you are the first generation

761
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,160
to go abroad, right?

762
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,510
Good insight.

763
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,470
I went overseas in the 1990s.

764
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,480
One of the beneficiaries

765
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,420
of China's reform and opening up.

766
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,540
Although now I am

767
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,100
a foreign national,

768
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,720
I still love China very much.

769
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,440
My Chinese name is,

770
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,510
Zhan Minsheng.

771
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,960
The pinyin abbreviation is

772
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,600
James.

773
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,360
Our Zhan family name,

774
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,890
has nearly 3000 years of history.

775
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,320
During the Zhou Dynasty,

776
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,050
our ancestor was granted the title of "Zhan Hou,"

777
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,590
and their descendants

778
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,520
take "Zhan" as their surname

779
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,760
ever since.

780
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,960
Zhan Tianyou

781
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,250
should also be your relative, right?

782
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,780
What about now?

783
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,090
Do your parents or any relatives

784
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,120
remain in China?

785
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,920
No,

786
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
my wife and children are all abroad.

787
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,980
I should say this.

788
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,610
-When I was six, I became an orphan.
-Thank you.

789
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,370
I come from a poor background.

790
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,340
My family were landowners,

791
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,880
so my grandparents

792
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,280
passed away before I was born.

793
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,960
As for my parents,

794
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,470
they also passed away

795
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,860
when I was around six.

796
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,120
You could say,

797
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,180
I was raised with the help of many people.

798
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,180
I'm who I am today

799
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,260
all thanks to the blessings of my ancestors.

800
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,710
I toast to you.

801
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,490
Although I left China very early,

802
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,920
every day,

803
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,600
I miss my motherland,

804
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,710
my hometown,

805
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,330
China's landscapes,

806
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,560
and Chinese culture.

807
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,000
Such as Confucianism, and the Four Books and Five Classics.

808
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,710
So,

809
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,750
when China hosted the Olympics

810
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,210
for the first time in 2008,

811
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,920
I voluntarily applied to come back here.

812
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,840
Later, as China's development continued to improve,

813
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,190
the headquarters decided to expand the business

814
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,480
in the Greater China region.

815
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,920
In 2013,

816
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,710
we recruited another batch of Chinese people.

817
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,000
That's when Zhao

818
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,320
joined Leader.

819
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,480
Taylor,

820
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,920
I think we also met

821
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,320
around that time, right?

822
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,840
Yes.

823
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,160
What about Taiheng?

824
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,230
I came a bit later.

825
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,880
Due to the company's expansion,

826
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,470
there was a need for additional staff in new business areas.

827
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,130
I was part of the second batch transferred over.

828
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,320
Do you know

829
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,150
the reason I decided

830
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,630
to go to the Leader?

831
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,670
At that time, J

832
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,360
approached me several times.

833
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,320
In the end,

834
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,590
he managed to get me

835
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,720
Taylor Swift concert

836
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,150
front-row tickets.

837
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,170
That's awesome!

838
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,030
I simply couldn't refuse.

839
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,150
Welcome to New York,

840
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,190
it's been waiting for you.

841
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,960
Zhao was an exceptional talent

842
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,800
I handpicked from millions.

843
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,990
Liu Bei had to visit Zhuge Liang three times,

844
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,990
but I've approached her five times!

845
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,500
I was convinced back then

846
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,920
that she would make a name for herself one day.

847
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,850
And sure enough,

848
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,030
in this aspect,

849
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,170
you and I have similar insights.

850
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,770
I remember seeing

851
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,510
a quote online before.

852
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Your gold that shines everywhere.

853
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,610
And you know,

854
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
even been through the fire,

855
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,440
it came through unblemished.

856
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,360
Even if it fall into water,

857
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,400
it will be refreshed.

858
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,760
Good.

859
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,070
Thank you.

860
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,800
When feelings run deep,

861
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
drink it all in one go.

862
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,890
Alright.

863
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,410
Director Yang,

864
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,320
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

865
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Okay.

866
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,400
During that time in Capital City,

867
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,110
I really appreciate your care and support.

868
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,040
Join us, will you?

869
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,570
Alright.

870
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,550
Come on, together.

871
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,420
Let's drink up, drink up!

872
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:01,900
Sure!

873
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,040
Excuse me,

874
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,330
where's the restroom?

875
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,320
Let Zhao take you there.

876
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,480
No need, just tell me where it is.

877
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,070
You don't have to go.

878
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,200
It's no trouble, I'll show you the way.

879
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,180
Excuse me for a moment.

880
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,410
On the left side.

881
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,440
Here.

882
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,960
He hasn't drunk enough yet.

883
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,820
It's on you now.

884
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,310
See how he is after drinking.

885
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,610
No problem.

886
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,010
How come you are all eating

887
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,280
and not drinking?

888
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,590
You, the guest of honor,

889
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,480
weren't here.

890
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
How could we drink?

891
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,410
Well, I'm back.

892
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,250
Let's drink together.

893
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,330
Alright, alright.

894
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:15,920
Bottoms up!

895
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,360
Cheers!

896
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:16,710
Okay.

897
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,480
Mr. Yang, your alcohol tolerance is pretty good, isn't it?

898
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,550
Are you mocking me?

899
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,640
How about we down a whole bottle?

900
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,020
Not a whole bottle.

901
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,330
Let's do the same as in Capital City.

902
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,960
Three bottles plus a bomb shot.

903
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,620
How's that?

904
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,070
Alright.

905
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,190
Okay, sure, sure.

906
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,300
It's okay, right?

907
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,430
Three bottles it is.

908
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,030
Three bottles?

909
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,360
Three bottles.

910
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,800
Come on.

911
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,320
Okay.

912
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,050
Follow my lead.

913
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,030
Three.

914
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,150
Two.

915
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:45,840
One.

916
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,520
Go!

917
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yang Guang, you can do it!

918
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,160
Taylor, come on!

919
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,590
This is the Leader Group.

920
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,850
Keep it up, Yang Guang!

921
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,320
Almost there, it's the second bottle already.

922
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,380
Hurry up, hurry up!

923
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,230
Faster, you idiot!

924
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,880
What the hell?

925
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,510
Third bottle, third bottle!

926
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,360
Hurry up. It's on!
