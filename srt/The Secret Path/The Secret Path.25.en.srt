1
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,229
Division Director Yang,

2
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,310
don't you have a private location?

3
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,310
Why meet out here?

4
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,789
That place is right across from James.

5
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,280
Zhao Yaning just went there yesterday.

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
With so many of us,

7
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,009
I think it's safer out here.

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,120
Sit.

9
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,509
Help yourself to a drink.

10
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,240
Take a break.

11
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:51,870
Okay.

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,300
Don't blame yourself too much

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,380
for what happened to Tian.

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,920
She fell into the sea with her car.

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
The water was so cold,

16
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,710
and she was all alone.

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,100
How desperate she must have felt.

18
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,150
Since we chose this job,

19
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,880
we also chose to face danger and death.

20
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,630
What we should do now

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,240
is to bring the murderer to justice.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,680
Right?

23
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,400
I know.

24
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,400
But I...

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,400
No buts.

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,660
Pull yourself together quickly.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,590
Can you recall

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,880
if Luca did anything unusual

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,870
around 11:30 last night?

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,630
At 11:30,

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,360
he exited the Yanping area on the highway.

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
That matches up.

33
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,310
Before that,

34
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,280
James was

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,520
pacing back and forth in the hotel garden.

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,960
Later, he received a message

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,150
and smiled.

38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,190
You mean

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,610
they're closely connected, aren't they?

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,000
Luca ran all night,

41
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,610
and James waited all night.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,560
He is not waiting for Luca himself,

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,280
but for the thing Luca has.

44
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,470
Last night, Luca switched cars so many times,

45
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,710
but the Lianhai Bureau checked all the surveillance footage

46
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,710
and didn't find anyone who delivered the cars.

47
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,520
It means

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
these cars were delivered to the service areas in advance.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,960
James.

50
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,310
James prepared them in advance

51
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,120
for this plan.

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,940
So, if that's the case,

53
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,310
Luca has already brought what they need

54
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,190
to Lianhai.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
They're about to

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,579
carry out their next step.

57
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,710
We really don't have much time left.

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,310
Tell me,

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,930
what's the plan?

60
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,370
You take Tan Yaoduo

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
and work with the Lianhai Bureau to keep a close eye on Luca.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,960
Ms. Ma and Chen Qiu will come with me.

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm going to plant bugs

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,450
in James's room.

65
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,520
Okay.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,360
This hotel is quite nice.

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,940
The weather is good today.

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,490
Hello, welcome.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,070
Hello.

70
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,920
This is the floor plan of the fifth floor.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,120
The elevator is here.

72
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,720
There are three emergency exits in total.

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,190
After we get out of the elevator,

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,510
I'll go directly to their room.

75
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,970
Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,000
Make sure you watch over it for me.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,390
Okay.

78
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,830
As for the equipment,

79
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,870
are you sure there's no problem?

80
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,390
No problem.

81
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,750
Okay.

82
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,200
Hello, Director Zhang.

83
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,230
You can call Xiang Taisheng now.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,270
Mr. Xiang,

85
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,830
this is Zhang Baiqing.

86
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,090
There's something...

87
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,159
Hey.

88
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,000
Ms. Zhao,

89
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,850
I'm Xiang Taisheng.

90
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,190
When you get to his room,

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,990
find a smoke detector like this.

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,430
Plant the bug inside.

93
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,600
Okay.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,320
Mr. Xiang.

95
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,080
Mr. Xiang.

96
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,070
Come, come.

97
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,720
If you need anything,

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,630
just let us know and we'll head to Pengze.

99
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,920
Pengze is a bit far.

100
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,270
This place is just right.

101
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,070
Please, have a seat.

102
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,630
Do we need to book a meeting room?

103
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,120
No need.

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Please, sit down.

105
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's wait for Manager Li to arrive,

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
then we'll go over the tour schedule

107
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,210
and discuss it thoroughly.

108
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,090
You can proceed.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,430
Hello.

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,330
Chen Qiu, Chen Qiu.

111
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,920
Now, there's a fire sensor

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
in both the living room

113
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,600
and the bedroom.

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,870
From a technical standpoint,

115
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,240
where would be the best

116
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,750
and safest place to install them?

117
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,680
It doesn't matter where they're installed.

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,190
This is a new deployed

119
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,510
type of listening device with built-in anti-scanning features.

120
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,040
It will be hard for them to detect.

121
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,770
Understood.

122
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,650
Chen Qiu.

123
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,150
Sound check.

124
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,870
Received.

125
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
One, two, three.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,870
One, two, three.

127
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,800
One, two, three.

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,159
The sound is very clear.

129
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,820
Roger that.

130
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,000
Sound check.

131
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,560
One, two, three.

132
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,760
One, two, three.

133
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,970
One, two, three.

134
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,080
The sound is very clear.

135
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,170
Roger that.

136
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,170
Manager Li,

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,610
the schedule for the visit in two days,

138
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,270
everything good on your end, right?

139
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,920
The arrangements are very reasonable.

140
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,070
Thank you for your hard work.

141
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,510
Of course, of course.

142
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,560
I need everyone

143
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,310
to send over

144
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,030
your passport photos again.

145
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,160
We need to report it.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,270
I'll send you the digital version shortly.

147
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,730
Thank you for your effort.

148
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
I have another meeting soon,

149
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,050
so I'll have to excuse myself.

150
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,110
Oh, right.

151
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,680
There's one more important thing.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,930
You can bring the

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,390
necessary equipment,

154
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,390
but avoid

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,390
carrying other items with you

156
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,510
to prevent

157
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,840
un-unnecessary trouble.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,150
Is that okay?

159
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,809
No problem.

160
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,630
Mr. Xiang,

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,150
is my cane alright?

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,510
Well,

163
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,520
that's fine.

164
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,170
Then I'll take my leave.

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,240
Alright, let me walk you out.

166
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
I'll walk you out.

167
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,390
Division Director Yang, the impromptu meeting is over.

168
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,120
Understood.

169
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,840
Take care, Mr. Xiang.

170
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,100
Take care, Manager Li.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,060
They're about to enter the elevator.

172
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,640
How did it go?

173
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,510
Don't you think a phone call

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
would've been enough for today's meeting?

175
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
Is it because they take it seriously?

176
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,580
If they take it seriously,

177
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,720
why didn't they arrange a separate meeting

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
instead of going for coffee?

179
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
Are you saying

180
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,750
they deliberately got us out of here?

181
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,370
But everything has been checked,

182
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,670
and it's indeed fine.

183
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,870
The thing I asked for

184
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
has already been delivered by Luca.

185
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,750
We must be cautious now.

186
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,530
Has the ultimate plan been set in motion?

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,550
What's my mission?

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,730
Ensure the nuclear power cooperation

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,460
proceeds without any accidents or changes.

190
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,480
At this point,

191
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,300
you're still keeping it a secret?

192
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,130
I'm not keeping it a secret.

193
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm not ready with the plan yet.

194
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,640
Wait for my message.

195
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
Go back and get some rest.

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,780
Be sure to check your room.

197
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,120
Okay.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,030
This James is quite cautious, isn't he?

199
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,240
He won't even tell his own people the specific plan.

200
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,790
But what we can be certain of now

201
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,870
is that Luca has

202
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,270
the equipment James needs

203
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,530
and it's related to this plan.

204
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,120
James will

205
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,870
definitely contact Luca as soon as possible

206
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,130
to get this equipment.

207
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,270
So from now on,

208
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,030
the three of us will take shifts

209
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,150
to monitor and surveil

210
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,270
24/7.

211
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,410
Okay, okay.

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Stop.

213
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,790
Mentor.

214
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,240
Hello.

215
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,720
Hello.

216
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,180
Police.

217
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,690
Is there anything I can help you with?

218
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,670
Did you tow this car here?

219
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,550
Yes, yes, yes.

220
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Take a look.

221
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,600
Are these the two people?

222
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,240
Yes, yes, yes.

223
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,840
It's them.

224
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,560
It's them.

225
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Where did they go?

226
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,480
They left in a car.

227
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,870
Which direction?

228
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,870
They turned right.

229
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,240
Okay.

230
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,000
Stay away from the window.

231
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,120
It's easy to get exposed.

232
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
From yesterday afternoon until now,

233
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,320
we've barely slept.

234
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,390
When is this going to end?

235
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,630
I'll contact him now.

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,530
Once the item is delivered,

237
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,600
we'll leave.

238
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,200
Li,

239
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,030
could you help me check a few license plates?

240
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,630
LianB2020C.

241
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,870
LianBC4149.

242
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,600
LianA4949C.

243
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,870
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

244
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,030
Miss Tian just had an emergency,

245
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,730
but she's been stabilized after treatment.

246
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,600
However, her condition is still not good right now.

247
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,460
You should be mentally prepared.

248
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,270
Okay.

249
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,880
Hello.

250
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,880
Any updates from there?

251
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,109
Well,

252
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,110
Tian was in critical condition.

253
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,610
Fortunately, the rescue was timely.

254
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,550
Otherwise, we would have lost her.

255
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,550
Keep it together.

256
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,240
Stay calm.

257
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,750
How can I stay calm?

258
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,640
You have no choice.

259
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,700
You must stay calm.

260
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,900
What good does it do to lose your cool now?

261
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,440
Will it help Tian get discharged,

262
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,840
or help us solve the case?

263
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
I understand how you are feeling right now,

264
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,250
but we have a greater responsibility to deal with right now.

265
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,750
I believe in Tian.

266
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,880
I also hope you can be

267
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,140
a courageous warrior,

268
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,960
rather than a coward who has lost their composure

269
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,360
and has no clue what to do.

270
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,500
Do you understand?

271
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:08,920
But

272
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,790
we've basically

273
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,960
been playing right into Luca's hands.

274
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,720
We're far too passive.

275
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,590
First, tell me

276
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,590
what did he do at the South City Mall?

277
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
He bought several sets of clothes.

278
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
About four sets, I guess.

279
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,840
He also bought a bag of food.

280
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,140
Buying clothes is to change his appearance.

281
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,130
Buying food is to reduce going out.

282
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
They should be looking for

283
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,960
a relatively safe place to stay.

284
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,070
A safe hideout?

285
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,920
With the crowds

286
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
and easy access to transportation,

287
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,160
who would even notice

288
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,550
two more unfamiliar faces?

289
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,920
Isn't it like finding a needle in a haystack?

290
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,850
It shouldn't be.

291
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,830
If we investigate carefully,

292
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,360
there should be some clues.

293
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,720
Okay, let me think about it more.

294
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,800
What Tian is going through now,

295
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,830
we've both experienced before.

296
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,020
And we're still alive, aren't we?

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,400
Trust me,

298
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,790
Tian will be fine.

299
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,610
Fortune favors the good-hearted.

300
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay.

301
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,610
Fortune favors the good-hearted.

302
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,350
What is it?

303
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,420
There's an important task

304
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
for you to handle.

305
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720
What's this?

306
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,960
A chip and a passport.

307
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,520
You need to deliver them to Luca.

308
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,270
Why should I give them to him?

309
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,470
The plan has changed.

310
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,270
The situation here is too dangerous.

311
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,850
The equipment I need

312
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,880
should be given to Luca to install and set up.

313
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,270
You trust him so much?

314
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,450
Don't you think I'm more suitable for this task?

315
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,850
You're too close to me.

316
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,400
If something goes wrong,

317
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
I'll be the first to be affected.

318
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,500
The reason I risked

319
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,390
having Luca do this task is that,

320
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,480
first,

321
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,150
I can keep him under control.

322
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,440
Second, if he gets caught,

323
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,070
we can leave right away.

324
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,590
I'll do as you say.

325
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,110
He will contact your

326
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,110
backup number directly.

327
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,920
How you meet up

328
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,570
is for you to figure out.

329
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,200
I'll be waiting for your good news.

330
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,930
Don't worry.

331
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,480
They are going to meep up.

332
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,070
You guys keep an eye on him here.

333
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,960
I'll follow Zhao Yaning.

334
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,310
Okay.

335
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,010
Alright.

336
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,070
Mentor.

337
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,510
With heavy foot traffic,

338
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,310
a complex mix of residents,

339
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,270
and convenient transportation,

340
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,510
only two places in Lianhai

341
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,510
meet all these conditions.

342
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,920
One is this seafood market,

343
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,790
which is also the closest to the South City Mall.

344
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,440
The other is near the edge of the city,

345
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
the Lianhai Wholesale Market.

346
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
This is an apartment.

347
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,550
Director Liu,

348
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,750
we've found something.

349
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,150
Luca is driving a black Volkswagen Lavida.

350
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
The most recent location

351
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,570
where this car was found

352
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,200
is the Lianhai Wholesale Market.

353
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,160
We're very close.

354
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,350
We can get there in ten minutes.

355
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,350
We just left too.

356
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,880
Considering the traffic,

357
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,960
it might take an hour.

358
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,690
See you soon.

359
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,900
What's wrong, mentor?

360
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,070
You're right.

361
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,400
Lianhai Wholesale Market.

362
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,930
Let's go.

363
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,030
Mentor.

364
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,880
You go that way.

365
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,160
I'll go this way.

366
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,490
Okay.

367
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,350
Li Jian.

368
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,450
Let's go.

369
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,110
Tan.

370
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,640
I've spotted Luca.

371
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,550
I'm going after them first.

372
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,350
Keep in touch.

373
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,450
Xiaoman.

374
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
We must complete the meet-up today,

375
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,350
but they're watching us too closely.

376
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,070
Now,

377
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,950
I can only rely on you.

378
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,250
You're inconspicuous.

379
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,880
I'll draw their attention,

380
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,530
and you handle the meet-up.

381
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,510
I...

382
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,520
I can't do it.

383
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,790
Xiaoman,

384
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
it's just picking up something.

385
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,110
Along with this,

386
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,880
your passport will be delivered as well.

387
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,350
Ah?

388
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,410
Don't worry.

389
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,680
I'll guide you through the whole process.

390
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,240
You need to believe in yourself.

391
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,970
You can do it.

392
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,440
Take out your phone and earphones.

393
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,270
Use this phone for now,

394
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,560
and make sure the earphones are connected too.

395
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,610
You must follow my instructions.

396
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,430
Don't run around aimlessly.

397
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,030
Darling,

398
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,330
let's fight for our future together.

399
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,400
You can do it.

400
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,520
Hold on tight.

401
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Darling,

402
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,440
act naturally.

403
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,530
Find the mall's floor plan.

404
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,070
Remember,

405
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,920
find a spot that's discreet, safe,

406
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,970
and easy to leave quickly.

407
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,550
I found it

408
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,640
as you asked.

409
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,600
Fire door number 3 on the first floor of Zone C.

410
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,240
Good.

411
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,920
Fire door number 3 on the first floor of Zone C.

412
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,200
He sent you here?

413
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,110
Do you regret

414
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,870
taking on this translation job?

415
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,890
Although his identity is special,

416
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,790
he's really good to me.

417
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,840
When we go to America together,

418
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,160
by then,

419
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,730
everything here will have nothing to do with us.

420
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,640
Ms. Zhao,

421
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,520
please hand over the items to me.

422
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,810
This is very important.

423
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,550
Take it.

424
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,220
Take care of yourself.

425
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,290
Mm-hmm.

426
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,790
I'm out. Where are you?

427
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,240
Get in the car.

428
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,090
You did a great job.

429
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,420
I don't want to do this kind of thing anymore.

430
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,320
Don't worry.

431
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,360
It's just a one-time thing.

432
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,810
I definitely don't want you to take risks.

433
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,640
This is all for our future.

434
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,480
I know.

435
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,640
So, is the mission considered complete now?

436
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,240
Of course.

437
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,030
When we go to America,

438
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,510
don't do this anymore.

439
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,920
It's too dangerous.

440
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,510
Let's find a place

441
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,270
to live a peaceful life, okay?

442
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,240
Okay.

443
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,440
I promise you.

444
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,000
We'll buy groceries and cook every day,

445
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,790
raise two dogs,

446
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,440
live quietly,

447
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,640
and never deal with these things again.

448
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,960
Open the file immediately.

449
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,960
They really did it.

450
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
But why only mine?

451
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,360
They were only willing to give me one first.

452
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,400
So,

453
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I asked for yours.

454
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,720
I can only get mine

455
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,400
once the task is fully completed.

456
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,720
Thank you, darling.

457
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,260
What else is there?

458
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
It's an address.

459
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,000
Give it to me.

460
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,440
Wait a moment.

461
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,550
We need to board the ship.

462
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,730
Give it to me first.

463
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,230
Here.

464
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,270
Slow down.

465
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,280
Okay.

466
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,590
Go in.

467
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,030
The people from State Security were chasing me a bit aggressively.

468
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,880
I think

469
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,420
you might have been targeted as well.

470
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,240
Although currently Luca

471
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,960
is unlikely to return to the wholesale market,

472
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
I have still increased the number of personnel

473
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,000
staking out there.

474
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,400
The surveillance system

475
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,770
is still constantly searching for Luca.

476
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,320
Due to my mistake,

477
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,290
I've caused a lot of trouble for everyone.

478
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,510
Section Chief Li,

479
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,140
please don't say that.

480
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,800
Thank you for your hard work, Director Liu.

481
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,480
Of course.

482
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,760
Zhao Yaning has already returned to the hotel.

483
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll leave things here to you.

484
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,630
Don't worry, Division Director Yang.

485
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,960
No matter what it takes,

486
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,400
I will find Luca.

487
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,680
I'm counting on you.

488
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,630
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

489
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,670
Do you want to grab a late-night snack together?

490
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,510
Let's go to the restaurant downstairs.

491
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:40,840
Hmm.

492
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,110
That location.

493
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,110
Didn't you check it already?

494
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,150
They're very cunning.

495
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,080
They've installed new equipment.

496
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,640
I wonder when they installed it.

497
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,150
Do you think they might have already obtained some information?

498
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,280
In my room,

499
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,070
I basically didn't say anything useful.

500
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,510
Now, this is the safest place.

501
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,990
Let me formally brief you on the situation.

502
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,840
Luca has already

503
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,400
safely arrived at the final rest area.

504
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,070
Our mission is about to begin.

505
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,180
The codename is

506
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,360
Peace Dove.

507
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,760
What's my mission?

508
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Our plan

509
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,110
is still missing the most crucial part.

510
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,240
This part needs to be completed by you.

511
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,070
Tomorrow, you must

512
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,480
meet Mr. Xiang

513
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,160
at the Pengze Hotel.

514
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,360
Our target

515
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,570
is the Pengze Hotel?

516
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,490
Don't ask too many questions now.

517
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,440
You need to use this meeting

518
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,760
to find a way

519
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,490
to thoroughly investigate

520
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,550
the Pengze Hotel.

521
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,720
Especially the hotel's environment and security conditions.

522
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,320
This is crucial

523
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,060
for our operation.

524
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,370
Alright.

525
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,150
I'll make the call now.

526
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,710
Don't.

527
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,200
Wait until you're near Pengze tomorrow to make the call.

528
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,170
Don't give them a chance to change the location.

529
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,380
You're so cunning.

530
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,760
Zhao,

531
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,800
don't forget,

532
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,510
this is my last mission

533
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,000
with Leader.

534
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,380
Congratulations.

535
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,430
You can finally go to Texas and live the ranch life.

536
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,670
Live as a great man,

537
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,340
and in death, remain a hero in spirit.

538
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,590
This is the last battle of my life.

539
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,010
Your journey is still long,

540
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,480
it's just beginning.

541
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,440
But I believe

542
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,510
you will definitely become

543
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,370
an outstanding woman.

544
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,520
I've already prepared the report.

545
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,400
When you return to headquarters,

546
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,000
you can directly attend the promotion dinner.

547
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,480
Thank you.

548
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,280
Remember

549
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,680
when you first joined the organization

550
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,920
and I told you

551
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,710
we are dancers on the edge of a blade.

552
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,760
To survive until the end,

553
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,510
your will must be as strong as steel,

554
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
your heart as delicate as a single hair,

555
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,290
and your patience as unyielding as stone.

556
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,440
It's not easy.

557
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,320
Following you all this way,

558
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,000
how could I not know?

559
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,670
Over these years, I've learned everything I should have,

560
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,030
and even things I shouldn't have.

561
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,190
Once the plan succeeds,

562
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,840
you can just relax and retire in Texas.

563
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,060
I've already bought you a cowboy hat.

564
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,790
Thank you.

565
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,320
Division Director Yang, you're back.

566
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,250
Is there any situation?

567
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,030
After Zhao Yaning returned,

568
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,070
she went straight to the hotel restaurant with James.

569
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,280
We were afraid of alerting them,

570
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,670
so we didn't dare to follow.

571
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,960
Did they talk about anything related to this operation?

572
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,030
Not a single word.

573
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,500
I even suspect that

574
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,360
James might have found out that we've been listening in.

575
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,030
It's late, and he is still going to the hotel restaurant with Zhao Yaning.

576
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,230
I think something's off.

577
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,960
Division Director Yang, please eat first.

578
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,590
I'm not hungry yet.

579
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,720
You go ahead and eat.

580
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,400
I'll listen to this afternoon's recording.
