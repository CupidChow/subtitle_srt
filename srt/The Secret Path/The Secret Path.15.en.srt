1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,860
Everything is subject to change.

2
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,729
You can do this.

3
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,759
Alright.

4
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,289
I'll give it a shot.

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Hello, hello.

6
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,090
Are you still in Capital City?

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,790
Yeah.

8
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,760
The meeting wraps up today.

9
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,280
Does that mean you'll be free after that?

10
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,870
There's still a bit of wrap-up work.

11
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,590
Once that's done, I'll head back to Yanping.

12
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,230
Not thinking about staying
in Capital City for a few more days?

13
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,360
I've got a ton of things waiting for me.

14
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,670
And it's not that easy

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,190
for us to take time off.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
We need to report to our superiors

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,930
and get official approval.

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,750
You hardly

19
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,470
ever get a chance to go abroad.

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,710
Now that you're out here fair and square,

21
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,560
why not take a few days off and relax?

22
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,000
Talk to your boss.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
That's just the nature of my job.

24
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,680
And I came with my colleagues.

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
We are a team.

26
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,960
I really messed things up

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,400
for you at work.

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,870
At least give me a chance

29
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,630
to make it up to you.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Let me show you around Capital City.

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,730
Why bring that up again?

32
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,400
Didn't we agree to let it go?

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,030
Just think about it.

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,520
Alright.

35
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll send you my hotel address.

36
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,310
Once you're done on your end,

37
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,750
you can move over here.

38
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,630
I've got something to take care of now.

39
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,800
Talk later. Bye.

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,360
There's been a development.

41
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,680
Yao Youzhi kept his word.

42
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,310
His secretary just called

43
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,680
to confirm a meeting with us

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,470
tomorrow at 2 pm in his office.

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,630
Great!

46
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,960
Mr. Yao, it's an honor to meet you.

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,870
We brought you a special gift from China.

48
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,800
Cordyceps.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,130
Hope you'll like it.

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,910
Lucy.

51
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,280
Your father's turning 70 this year,

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,120
right?

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
Cordyceps is really good for his health.

54
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,680
This is for him.

55
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,480
Thank you very much.

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,430
Mr. Yao.

57
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,920
I know there's been history between

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,980
you and our company president James.

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,630
But that was in the past.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,560
We were simply doing our jobs,

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,310
representing different interests.

62
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,870
It was never personal.

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,120
I understand

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,390
what you are here for.

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,300
You have 5 minutes.

66
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,390
If you can't convince me by then,

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
this is over.

68
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,420
I hope you understand.

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,680
When it comes to HTGR technologies,

70
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,070
no PR firm knows more about it

71
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,630
than Leader Group.

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
And no PR firm enjoys as much trust

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,160
from Huaze Group as we do.

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,270
This partnership is about

75
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,510
mutual benefit.

76
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,070
I hope you'll give it serious consideration.

77
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,800
Huaze Group?

78
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,720
Don't try to pressure me with Huaze Group.

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,680
I can talk to them any time

80
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,530
and have you replaced.

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,680
But from a professional PR perspective...

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,410
I don't have time for a lecture.

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
Just get to the point.

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,750
I know Taiyu Group has been trying

85
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,920
to break into the Chinese market.

86
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,310
For the past 2 years...

87
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,110
But honestly,

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,159
I don't trust you.

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,630
We've already signed a preliminary agreement

90
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,310
with Huaze Group.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,520
As for you,

92
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,120
I can offer a discounted service fee on that basis.

93
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Time's up.

94
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,040
Sorry.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
That's it.

96
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,870
I

97
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,510
won't let Leader Group

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,730
become the PR firm for our project.

99
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,920
This decision is final.

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,500
I hope you enjoy your trip.

101
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,750
Stay a few more days in Capital City.

102
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,550
Buy some skin care products.

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,000
What a waste of time.

104
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,720
Let's go.

105
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,830
Stupid.

106
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
No respect at all.

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,040
This is the most rude person I've ever met in my career.

108
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,270
From start to finish,
he never had any intention of negotiating with us.

109
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,390
He agreed

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,800
to meet us

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
just to humiliate us.

112
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,620
The more he acts like this,

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,120
the more determined I am to get this deal.

114
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,050
How do we do that?

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
We go to the hotel first.

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,270
I'll report to J.

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Yao gave me five minutes,

118
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,360
but he interrupted me 3 times
while I was speaking.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,830
This isn't a negotiation.

120
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,490
It's just him messing with us.

121
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,170
Do you think it's impossible?

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,070
I just checked.

123
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,000
In the past year,

124
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,800
he's used a PR firm called Kangnai

125
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
for three of his overseas projects.

126
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,890
The head of it is his cousin.

127
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,680
So I believe this time,

128
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
he'll probably hand the project

129
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,390
to a PR firm

130
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,590
he can fully control.

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,510
We might have come all the way here for nothing.

132
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,920
Zhao.

133
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,120
We need to get Yao Youzhi no matter the cost.

134
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,120
But the usual negotiation tactics

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,310
won't work.

136
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,610
So we'll use unconventional methods.

137
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,560
Listen up.

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,070
By any means necessary.

139
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,120
Leader Group must become

140
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,720
the only PR firm for the nuclear power project.

141
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,120
This won't be easy.

142
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,240
So I have to ask.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,130
Is this cooperation

144
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,270
related to our larger plan?

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,950
It's the boss's order.

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,810
You know the stakes.

147
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,160
Alright, I got it.

148
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,920
Zhao.

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,750
I trust you.

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
Has J ever said

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,900
“by any means necessary” before?

152
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,160
No.

153
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,230
Actually, I don't get it.

154
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,750
This is just a regular nuclear power project.

155
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,510
The technology is top-notch,

156
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,200
but it doesn't seem worth
him giving it this much attention.

157
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,480
Do you know why?

158
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,750
How did he talk to us?

159
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,240
He's a sly old fox.

160
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,160
Besides, it doesn't matter whether he said it or not.

161
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,390
The key is that we need to take action.

162
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,390
We need a plan,

163
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,150
and we need to

164
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,200
move forward.

165
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,960
What do you think?

166
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,549
Let's do this the hard way.

167
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,669
He's already been tough with us,

168
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,000
so what's the next step?

169
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
Have you noticed the relationship

170
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,970
between him and his secretary?

171
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,960
I noticed it right away.

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,120
His secretary has a nice figure.

173
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,200
Yao Youzhi was staring at her lecherously。

174
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,600
They

175
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,480
seem to have a special bond.

176
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,270
Let's dig deeper,

177
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,080
and see if we can gather some evidence.

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,910
That's a good idea. I'm on board.

179
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,320
But it's not going to be easy.

180
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,030
This is his turf.

181
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,630
You can do whatever you want?

182
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,440
I'll go contact our informant

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
and see what we can dig up.

184
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,670
Miss.

185
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,030
Here's the proof of Yao Youzhi

186
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,270
bribing executives and cohabiting with his subordinate.

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,440
You were right.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,150
They're having an affair.

189
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,000
While these pieces of evidence

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,080
will have some impact when exposed,

191
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,790
I feel like it's still not enough.

192
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,910
The bribe could be explained as a loan,

193
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,150
and the photos of his secretary

194
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,200
could be passed off as part of her job.

195
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,080
We need to go directly to his house

196
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,010
and find the most direct evidence.

197
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,670
It'd be best if we could capture something explosive,

198
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,600
either on video or through photos.

199
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,000
Good, good, good.

200
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,320
This is my favorite game.

201
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,980
Yang Guang.

202
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,080
Hi.

203
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,030
What kind of expression is that?

204
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,240
Surprise, or shock?

205
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,350
Wait a minute.

206
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,890
You really came.

207
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,390
You extended the invitation,

208
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
so I couldn't refuse.

209
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Let me introduce.

210
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,960
These two are my colleagues.

211
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,550
This is my good friend Yang Guang from Yanping.

212
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,910
Hi.

213
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,080
Hi.

214
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,120
I'm Taylor from the International Business Department of Leader Group.

215
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,150
Nice to meet you.

216
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,900
Your Chinese is very good.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm Li Taiheng, Vice Minister from the International Business Department.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,930
Nice to meet you.

219
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm Yang Guang.

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,390
General Manager of Yanping Chaoyang Trading Company.

221
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,440
Nice to meet you.

222
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,550
Alright, you two go ahead.

223
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,960
After his check-in,

224
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
we can continue talking.

225
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,320
Okay.

226
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:05,870
Okay.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Let's give them some space.

228
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,390
Just joking.

229
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,280
These two are pretty funny.

230
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:15,670
Hi,

231
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
please give him a room on the seventh floor.

232
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,240
And bill it together with room 0721

233
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,600
under the Leader Group.

234
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,210
Okay, one moment, please.

235
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,480
Wait.

236
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,790
I'll pay for the room myself.

237
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,720
Okay.

238
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,550
This time, I'm not taking care of anything.

239
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,000
Please.

240
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,600
Yes, please.

241
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,670
Okay.

242
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,120
Here's your room card. Enjoy your stay.

243
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,670
Thank you.

244
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,270
Thank you.

245
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,440
Let's go.

246
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,390
Mr. Yang is cautious.

247
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,430
Mr. Yang doesn't want to write a self-reflection.

248
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,390
Left.

249
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,120
Okay.

250
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,700
Come in.

251
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,120
I thought your boss wouldn't agree

252
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,870
to let you take time off.

253
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,480
How about your colleagues?

254
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,140
They've gone back to Yanping.

255
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,290
The room is quite large.

256
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,910
Yeah.

257
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,720
At the Capital City Hotel,

258
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,250
there aren't many rooms with this much space.

259
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,630
It's very convenient.

260
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,490
Lots of restaurants downstairs.

261
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,690
Pretty good.

262
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,750
New development.

263
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,630
Sorry.

264
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,120
I still have some work to finish.

265
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,670
I'll join you for dinner

266
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,750
in about 40 minutes.

267
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,480
No problem, you go ahead.

268
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,390
See you later.

269
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,190
See you later.

270
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,480
Goodbye.

271
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,360
Goodbye.

272
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,440
Alright.

273
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,510
I'll send you my hotel address.

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
Once you're done on your end,

275
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,960
you can move over here.

276
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I've got something to take care of now.

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,750
Talk later. Bye.

278
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,720
[The Capital City Hotel's Location]

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,670
Hello?

280
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,600
Hello, Director Zhang.

281
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,080
They've invited me

282
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,870
to stay a few more days in Capital City.

283
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,870
This is a great opportunity for us to get close to them.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,530
Alright,

285
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,730
then let's go along with it.

286
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,200
I'll apply for special approval for you

287
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,530
to stay in Capital City.

288
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,730
Ms. Zhao.

289
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,530
There's new progress?

290
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,670
The villa location has been confirmed.

291
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,130
It's at the Guangya Villa.

292
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Security measures are very strict.

293
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,790
Non-owners have to go through

294
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,650
detailed registration to enter.

295
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,240
Yao Youzhi lives in No.13,

296
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,840
and the owner's registration
is under his younger brother's name.

297
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,150
Okay, I'll investigate the villa situation.

298
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,670
You focus on getting his schedule for these days.

299
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,600
We'll work separately.

300
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,030
Okay.

301
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,170
Don't worry.

302
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,730
Alright.

303
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,360
J.

304
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,300
I heard Yang Guang went to see you.

305
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,460
They report back pretty quickly.

306
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,240
After Yang Guang finished his work,

307
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,030
he asked for leave and came over.

308
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,480
Good.

309
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,580
We must take advantage of this opportunity.

310
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
This is a rare chance.

311
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,510
Honestly,

312
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,910
the incident before we came to Capital City

313
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,680
was really awkward.

314
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,360
I don't feel very confident about it.

315
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
You have to trust your charm.

316
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,670
I think that

317
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,200
as long as he came to see you,

318
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,440
it means he has a deep liking for you.

319
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,200
As for what you said,

320
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,790
I think he's already understood
and forgiven you.

321
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,960
Maybe.

322
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,140
But this kind of negotiation,

323
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,850
whether it succeeds or not,

324
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,790
depends on who can stay calm,

325
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,870
doesn't it?

326
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,200
You can decide the pace.

327
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,670
But I think

328
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,180
if we can win him over in Capital City,

329
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,510
once we return to Yanping,

330
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,750
we'll be able to ask him for help.

331
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,330
Like strengthening relations

332
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,000
with Huaze Group.

333
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,440
Alright, I'll give it a try.

334
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,470
Of course,

335
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,510
you still need to stay alert.

336
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,550
After all, his position is special.

337
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,910
You can't be too careless.

338
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,310
I understand.

339
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,560
Alright.

340
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,270
I believe in your abilities.

341
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,440
I look forward to your success.

342
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,970
Alright.

343
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,720
Hi.

344
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,000
Hi.

345
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,640
Wow.

346
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,829
You wear so formal

347
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,960
for the dinner.

348
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,680
Is my outfit

349
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,310
not a bit mismatched with yours?

350
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,369
Before we eat, come with me to a place.

351
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,880
Where?

352
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,510
Guangya Villa.

353
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,829
Dining in a villa?

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How fancy.

355
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,839
I really like Capital City.

356
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,400
So I'm thinking of buying a house here.

357
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,720
Li Taiheng recommended

358
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,849
Guangya Villa to me.

359
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,110
I'd like you to accompany me for a visit.

360
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,750
I think right now,

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,750
investments should be cautious.

362
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,640
It's better to keep the money
in your own hands for now.

363
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:36,970
Okay.

364
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,270
Can you drive?

365
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,720
Yes.

366
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,690
Let's go.

367
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,070
Hello, J.

368
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,720
Who are you with?

369
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
Li Taiheng.

370
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,030
Do you want to find Zhao?

371
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,440
No.

372
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,480
This matter,

373
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,400
only the two of you

374
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,130
need to know.

375
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,790
Alright.

376
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,310
Go ahead.

377
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,410
You need to closely monitor

378
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,720
Zhao

379
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,310
and Yang Guang,

380
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,120
especially Yang Guang.

381
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,540
You mean, you don't trust Yang Guang?

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,160
You don't know.

383
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,440
He's an agent from State Security.

384
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,750
His identity

385
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,880
is too special.

386
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,920
So we have to prevent him from

387
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
having any personal plans or ideas.

388
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,510
If he's playing a part,

389
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,520
any suspicious move would mean

390
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,480
that the Chinese Ministry of State Security

391
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,270
has already targeted Leader Group.

392
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,870
And we'll need to figure out how to deal with it.

393
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,640
If necessary,

394
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,240
we can eliminate him.

395
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,550
We can make him disappear.

396
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,750
In a foreign country,

397
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,090
it'll be harder for them to investigate.

398
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,830
Anyway,

399
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,790
we cannot let anyone

400
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
affect our plans.

401
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,400
Got it.

402
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,960
We'll keep an eye on them, don't worry.

403
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,680
That's it.

404
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,030
From now on,

405
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,480
you're my fiancé.

406
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,750
This will help me bargain.

407
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,860
Don't talk too much later.

408
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,700
Are you interested in Guangya Villa?

409
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,240
Great choice.

410
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,590
This is one of the most luxurious

411
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,640
villa areas in the Capital City.

412
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,480
But the price is also very expensive...

413
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,310
Price is not an issue.

414
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,030
Got it.

415
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,190
By the way,

416
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,110
I studied in China before.

417
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,660
You can speak Chinese.

418
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,160
We're in a rush.

419
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,030
Do you have any available house?

420
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,310
We want to see the houses first.

421
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,070
Of course.

422
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,480
Hello.

423
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,590
Are you the resident here?

424
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,880
Hey, excuse me.

425
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,200
I'm the agent from Rich Real Estate.

426
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,110
And they're the visitors for buying the property here.

427
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,640
I'm pretty close with your boss.

428
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,900
Okay, please hurry up.

429
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,200
Thanks a lot.

430
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,310
In this noisy era,

431
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,880
the exterior of buildings can be cloned,

432
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,440
but only the environment of the building,

433
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,880
just like your two temperaments,

434
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,480
is unique.

435
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,480
The Guangya Villa

436
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,400
is located...

437
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
What kind of people live here?

438
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,920
You're asking the right person.

439
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,850
These are all well-known figures,

440
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,550
some are even celebrities.

441
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,400
Superstar.

442
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,710
The environment here is not bad, right?

443
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,960
Which direction is north?

444
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,240
It's this way.

445
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,880
It is not north?

446
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
This is south.

447
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,240
Fine.

448
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,380
Let me introduce it to you.

449
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,750
This is No.11,

450
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,400
12,

451
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,310
13,

452
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,720
all the way to No.19.

453
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,440
This side is from No. 21 to 29.

454
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,590
The ones ahead

455
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,240
are No. 31 to 39.

456
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,200
Let's walk this way.

457
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,720
Of course.

458
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,310
Please.

459
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,750
Every road is connected

460
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,960
in the Guangya Villa.

461
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,110
It's very convenient.

462
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,880
This is No.12.

463
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,270
That's No.13.

464
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,310
Each villa complements each other,

465
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,310
but also

466
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,790
has its own unique style.

467
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,480
The greenery you see now

468
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,610
was designed by a German designer,

469
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,590
Stefan.

470
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Look at this tree, its shape

471
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,160
is quite interesting.

472
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,220
It has been around for about 15 years.

473
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,750
So,

474
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,720
villas of this standard

475
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,440
are truly rare to come by.

476
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,240
I know the price...

477
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,070
I'll buy it.

478
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,040
Full payment.

479
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,310
The transfer has a limit.

480
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,110
Tomorrow,

481
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,310
I'll bring a check to the store to find you.

482
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,880
Ms. Zhao,

483
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
thank you so much.

484
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Thank you.

485
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,350
Thank you, thank you very much.

486
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,790
Can you pay the deposit today?

487
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,550
No problem.

488
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,960
Then please follow me.

489
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,150
You go ahead.

490
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,440
I'll walk around with my husband.

491
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
We want to

492
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,380
feel the atmosphere here.

493
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,440
We can also plan for

494
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,110
future renovation and decoration.

495
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,510
Right?

496
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,920
Yes.

497
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,310
I'll leave you two.

498
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,400
Enjoy.

499
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,540
Really buying?

500
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,510
Who's buying?

501
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,030
Didn't you say we need to
keep the money in our hands?

502
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,290
I just want to walk around the community.

503
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, Long. Okay. I got it. I'll be right there.

504
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
What are the clients?

505
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,790
They just wonder to take a bit more time to look around.

506
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,740
I'm not sure that's really appropriate.

507
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,880
Why not?

508
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
They've already decided to buy.

509
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
And they'll gonna be the owners.

510
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,440
Don't disturb them. You know, it won't help you.

511
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
They're my clients, just trust me.

512
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,030
Thanks a lot.

513
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,830
It seems like we've circled back around.

514
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,760
We were just walking up from below.

515
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,480
Wait for me.

516
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,250
Let's go.

517
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,720
Is No.13 villa

518
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,710
your friend's house?

519
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,430
You seem especially interested in this villa.

520
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
When we just passed here,

521
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,700
you took out your phone

522
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,030
and recorded a video.

523
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,690
Sorry, I didn't mean anything.

524
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,030
It's just a professional habit.

525
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,630
I couldn't help but say something when I saw it.

526
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,270
I don't need you to answer me,

527
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,870
but I also want to remind you,

528
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,010
don't do anything illegal.

529
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,000
This is the home of Mr. Yao Youzhi,
the president of Taiyu Group.

530
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
Our initial negotiations

531
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
failed.

532
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,960
Li Taiheng and the others

533
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,360
are preparing new plans.

534
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,640
I came here

535
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,350
just in case.

536
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,030
If necessary,

537
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,000
I'll have to block him at his house.

538
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,730
Then you could've just told me.

539
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Didn't you already figure it out?

540
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,030
Don't flatter me.

541
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I'm starving.

542
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,960
I'll treat you to the most authentic food.

543
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,820
How authentic?

544
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,490
You'll know once you try it.

545
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,570
Hello, Minister Li.

546
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,040
I'm having dinner with Mr. Yang.

547
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,200
Sorry.

548
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,340
Let me tell you.

549
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,960
About Yao Youzhi's schedule,

550
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,830
I've tried everything,

551
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,110
but I still can't find anything.

552
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,520
His schedule is extremely secret.

553
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,580
There's no info from the outside.

554
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,000
Do you know who has it?

555
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,640
The secretary's office of the CEO.

556
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,030
They'd definitely know

557
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,350
their own boss's schedule.

558
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,830
I've tried reaching out to them,

559
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,630
but I haven't been able to get it.

560
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,480
I'm worried it'll delay things,

561
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
so I had to let you know.

562
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,680
I'll think about it.

563
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,010
Alright.

564
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,150
What's wrong?

565
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,680
You looked worried

566
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,360
right after the call.

567
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,200
We've been trying to find out

568
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,510
Yao Youzhi's schedule,

569
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,370
hoping to set up another meeting.

570
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,510
But we've

571
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,750
got nothing so far.

572
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,890
Haste makes waste.

573
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,210
You don't need to rush so much.

574
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,550
Eat first.

575
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,680
When you're hungry,

576
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,940
nothing else matters.

577
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,160
Can you do me a favor?

578
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,160
So, do you have an appointment with President Yao?

579
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,480
No, I don't.

580
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,880
But I'm hoping to do an interview with President Yao.

581
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,000
My name is Casey Moore.

582
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,070
And I'm with the Financial Times.

583
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,070
Is he available right now?

584
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,830
I'm sorry.

585
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,400
President Yao has been very busy recently.

586
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,960
We need his approval before we can schedule an interview.

587
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Okay, I know.

588
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,880
So could you please call him now

589
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
to check?

590
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,480
Well, to be honest, I'm not familiar with you.

591
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,640
And I've never heard of your name before.

592
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,030
Hi,

593
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,510
what's your name?

594
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,110
Chloe.

595
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,200
Hi, Chloe, nice to meet you.

596
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,880
Nice to meet you.

597
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,270
You can call me Tom Jerry.

598
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,000
Hi, Jerry.

599
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,920
Hey, listen.

600
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,070
This is an urgent task.

601
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,000
And for this interview,

602
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,240
I want to talk about

603
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,500
the recent rumors about the sanction against Taiyu Group.

604
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,350
You know.

605
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,160
Our Finance Times

606
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,550
is a highly influential media.

607
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,550
And our reports

608
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,310
can impact your group's future.

609
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,030
I really hope

610
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,880
we can clear up any misunderstandings as soon as possible.

611
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,830
So,

612
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,310
I think you should take my proposal seriously.

613
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,750
So may I see your press cards, please?

614
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,680
Oh, sure.

615
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,510
And yours?

616
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,110
If you don't trust us,

617
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
then we'll

618
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,880
respond accordingly.

619
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,720
I think you'd better understand the result of this.

620
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,850
You know what I mean？

621
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,680
Hold on, please.

622
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,070
Thanks a lot.

623
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
So he's not available tomorrow.

624
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,510
How about the day after tomorrow
at 3 pm here in the meeting room?

625
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,350
Great.

626
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,590
Thank you, appreciate it.

627
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,790
Thank you.

628
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,480
Have a nice day.

629
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,940
You too.

630
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,400
Turn on your Bluetooth.

631
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,640
Okay.

632
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,320
You're really good at this.

633
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,790
So are you.

634
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,680
Tom Jerry, Casey Moore.

635
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,240
Which one do you like?

636
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
Tom or...

637
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,110
Alright, it's sent.

638
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,440
Good.

639
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,390
Tomorrow morning, he'll be at the golf course.

640
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,070
That should be an opportunity.

641
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,870
I'll meet him.

642
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,750
Okay.

643
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,390
From here on, it's your turn.

644
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,510
Excuse me.

645
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,240
I want to take this.

646
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,570
Okay.

647
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,350
Okay.

648
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,110
Thank you so much.

649
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,850
What did you buy?

650
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,970
It's for you.

651
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,630
Thank you.

652
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,990
It's pretty special.

653
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,200
It's not something expensive.

654
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,350
But, like you said,

655
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,030
it's pretty special.

656
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Have you seen my department's logo?

657
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,110
No.

658
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,880
How could I have seen it?

659
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,640
Sword, shield, Great Wall, pine branches.

660
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,590
The sword is hidden behind the shield,

661
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,160
only the hilt and the tip of the sword are visible.

662
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,020
Doesn't that seem quite similar?

663
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,960
So what does this mean?

664
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,640
The sword is hidden in the shield,

665
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
shown only by the shield,

666
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,590
and the sharp edge warns the enemy.

667
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,720
If the shield fails,

668
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,270
the sword will strike,

669
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,990
slaying the enemy and protecting our land.

670
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,350
I didn't know

671
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,180
it had so much meaning.

672
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,840
So why are you giving me this?

673
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,600
To protect your safety.

674
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,600
I wish you always walk on the right path.

675
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
Is it in your role as Division Director Yang

676
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,510
or Sonny?

677
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,880
Tom Jerry.

678
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,890
Help me put it on.

679
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,350
Okay.

680
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,970
There you go.

681
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,240
Thank you, I really like it.

682
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,770
No problem.

683
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:39,920
Tired?

684
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,450
Not really.

685
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,590
After having an ice cream cone, I woke up.

686
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,720
Want to climb a hill?

687
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,400
What?

688
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
There's a mountain in Capital City.

689
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,590
We can see the city's night view from it.

690
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,850
It's right in the city.

691
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,200
Okay, go.

692
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,750
Go.

693
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,719
I'll take this call.

694
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,000
Hello?

695
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,139
Yang Guang is with you, right?

696
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:16,920
Yes.

697
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,840
When will you be back?

698
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,800
We still need to discuss

699
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,280
the next steps.

700
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,070
About an hour.

701
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,030
Will that be fine?

702
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,670
That'll be fine, no problem.

703
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,860
We'll wait for you.

704
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,230
If you're busy,

705
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,210
just go back.

706
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,230
We'll climb another day.

707
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,960
It's fine.

708
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,840
We're here already,

709
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,300
it'd be a shame not to go up.

710
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,650
Okay.

711
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,960
Let's make a bet.

712
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,000
Whoever gets to the top first wins.

713
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,880
The winner can

714
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,110
ask the other person

715
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,920
a question.

716
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,190
Isn't that childish?

717
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,280
What's the bet?

718
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,840
Dare to bet money?

719
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,199
Alright.

720
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,510
Get ready, go.

721
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,010
The tortoise and the hare, huh?

722
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,510
There's no problem with the sound.

723
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,150
Bingo.

724
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,670
Okay.

725
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,110
Not bad.

726
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,440
You've been working out, huh?

727
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,550
Of course.

728
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,030
You're not bad, Director Yang.

729
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,290
I almost couldn't catch up with the hare.

730
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,110
Let's call it a draw.

731
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,320
We can each ask one question.

732
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,850
Alright.

733
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,090
Isn't it beautiful?

734
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,320
Yes.

735
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,770
It really is quite beautiful.

736
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,310
Go ahead, ask.

737
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I want to ask you,

738
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,510
you've always trusted me,

739
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,280
right?

740
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I trust the facts.

741
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,600
I trust the evidence.

742
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,800
If the facts and evidence

743
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,950
prove that you're a good person,

744
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,060
then why wouldn't I trust you?

745
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,480
If the facts and evidence

746
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,110
don't prove,

747
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,910
would you still trust me?

748
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,480
That's another question.

749
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,610
You broke the rules.

750
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,640
Alright.

751
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,590
Ask.

752
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,360
If the facts and evidence

753
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,590
don't prove,

754
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,950
should I still trust you?

755
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,710
I hope you can trust me.

756
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,250
Yang Guang.

757
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,640
Photoshop it.

758
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,960
Photoshop it.

759
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,810
I'm really happy today.

760
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,990
How about you?

761
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,890
Quite relaxed.

762
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,240
You're right.

763
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,300
Sometimes taking a break,

764
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,380
I feel pretty good.

765
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,690
That's good.

766
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,000
Thank you

767
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,710
for helping me so much today.

768
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,890
No problem.

769
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,850
Goodnight.

770
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,890
Goodnight.

771
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
Where's my cup?

772
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,790
So why are you giving me this?

773
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,770
To protect your safety.

774
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,440
I wish you always walk

775
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
on the right path.

776
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,670
Electric motors for dump trucks manufactured by Geely-Tuo

777
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,530
are being produced at full speed.

778
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,670
The most advanced electric motors in the world

779
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,670
The most advanced electric motors in the world

780
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,190
will be installed between the rear wheels of the dump truck,

781
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,760
driving the rear wheels to rotate.

782
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,880
This technology makes the operation of the dump truck

783
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,440
more reliable and powerful.

784
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Such a boring man.

785
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,740
All he does when he comes back is watching TV.

786
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,840
But the world hasn't...

787
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Who's that?

788
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,150
It's me.

789
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,510
Wait a minute.

790
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:12,510
Hi.

791
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,070
Hi.

792
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,590
Hi.

793
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,020
What are you doing?

794
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,890
Waiting for you.

795
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,110
Waiting for you to discuss

796
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,760
the next steps.

797
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,460
What's that sound?

798
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,450
It's the phone.

799
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,400
The sound of the phone ringing.

800
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,570
Tomorrow morning,

801
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,730
Yao Youzhi will be at the golf course,

802
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,070
playing with the Deputy Minister of Electricity.

803
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,150
I need to know his whereabouts at all times.

804
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,440
You two are responsible for following him.

805
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Then you're in charge of installing the equipment.

806
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,070
I'll go.

807
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,510
Today, I've been to the Guangya Villa,

808
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,840
and I've already checked the security and environment of the community.

809
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,320
Good.

810
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,800
Then let's keep a close eye on him tomorrow.
