1
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,570
I'll leave after the laundry is done.

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,729
You didn't throw up in the bedroom, right?

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,310
No.

4
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,310
Don't give me any booze.

5
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,280
I really can't drink anymore.

6
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,940
I really...

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
You can really drink.

8
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,800
Great.

9
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,310
You asked me

10
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,110
how it feels to do this job.

11
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Now I can tell you.

12
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,079
It's too tiring.

13
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,360
I thought about changing a job too.

14
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,930
But how could that be easy?

15
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,190
Do you know why?

16
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,560
For...

17
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,360
Money.

18
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,560
For money?

19
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,430
Right?

20
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,630
You're right.

21
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,960
For money.

22
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,630
For money.

23
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,050
Stop drinking.

24
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,810
We don't have much hangover soup left.

25
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,390
What's wrong?

26
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,519
Are you unhappy tonight?

27
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm quite happy during the time

28
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,070
I am with you.

29
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,270
Happy?

30
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,390
But you thought of me as a suspect at first,

31
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,260
and you followed me every day.

32
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,560
Sorry.

33
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,430
But you later went to the Capital City.

34
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,310
And now,

35
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm at your place then.

36
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,270
Don't you think

37
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,270
we're kind of split personalities?

38
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,180
But I am really quite happy

39
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
during this time.

40
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,750
Really quite happy.

41
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,360
Hey.

42
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,830
Hey.

43
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
Good morning.

44
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,600
Morning.

45
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,080
Why am I sleeping here?

46
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,600
You were drunk last night.

47
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,910
So I carried you in.

48
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,390
I was worried that if you asked for anything

49
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,270
in the evening, and I couldn't hear you outside.

50
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,240
But don't worry.

51
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,270
I slept on the floor all night.

52
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,950
Don't drink so much again in the future.

53
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,870
I'll give you one week.

54
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,360
Go get him completely.

55
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,200
Let me make you some noddles.

56
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,750
You'll feel better after eating some.

57
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,880
It'll be ready soon.

58
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm late.

59
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,120
Thank you for taking care of me last night.

60
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,630
I'm leaving.

61
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,700
You don't have to rush.

62
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,980
Eat some before you go.

63
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,990
I've got some issues at work.

64
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,240
Here.

65
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,500
Let me walk you out.

66
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,050
Are you sober completely now?

67
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,950
Are you sure there's no problem?

68
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,200
Bye.

69
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,200
Bye.

70
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,240
Stop.

71
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,870
Let me check the person in the white car.

72
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,790
Zoom in here.

73
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,460
You were right next to him,

74
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,080
but he didn't do anything?

75
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,840
I already got myself drunk.

76
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,410
But he didn't touch me.

77
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,320
What a gentleman.

78
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm a little tired.

79
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,510
I have to go back and take a rest.

80
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,510
Have a good rest.

81
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,790
J,

82
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,730
you arranged Taylor to follow me?

83
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,300
Do you really think I'm that untrustworthy?

84
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,360
Hello?

85
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,270
Zhao,

86
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm sorry.

87
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,030
I promise that something like following you

88
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,440
will never happen again.

89
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
Alright, I got it.

90
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,670
Don't be mad anymore.

91
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,240
Once the plan is made,

92
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,270
then

93
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,480
I'll tell you right away.

94
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,750
Now,

95
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
we must ensure the side of Yang Guang

96
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,910
is safe.

97
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,240
So, you need to get him

98
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,320
as soon as possible.

99
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,430
I've already set aside a budget

100
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,760
for your relationship.

101
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,270
You can use it however you like.

102
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,750
Okay, I understand.

103
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,870
[The $100,000 dating fund has been deposited]

104
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,920
Thank you, Uncle Li.

105
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,080
Don't always call me "Uncle".

106
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,340
Can you call me "Jian"?

107
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,750
Keeping watch in the car is even more exhausting

108
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,360
than labouring in the office for two days.

109
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,550
You were crying for going on field work.

110
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,030
What? Do you regret it after just two days?

111
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,510
How can I regret it?

112
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,240
What's the job we're doing?

113
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,510
It's protecting our country.

114
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,910
I'd risk my life to protect

115
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,260
the safety of the country and its people.

116
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,250
You... You say it again?

117
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,680
Protecting country...

118
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,589
I think

119
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,550
you just need to

120
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,200
protect your belly, okay?

121
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,829
I only brought one bag of food.

122
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
But you ate them all.

123
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,829
Uncle.

124
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,270
Yes?

125
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,069
You are

126
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,130
really good at taking care of others.

127
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,240
But for your mouth, do you feel uncomfortable

128
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,300
when you're not arguing with others?

129
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,310
Why do I feel like

130
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,440
it's always you who's arguing with me?

131
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,930
I'm impressed.

132
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,720
Totally impressed.

133
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,200
That's all I need.

134
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,270
I'll buy you something to eat.

135
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,590
Jian, I know you're

136
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,720
both handsome and kind.

137
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Can I order?

138
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,510
No need.

139
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,790
Soy milk with sugar,

140
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,050
green onion pork buns,

141
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,160
flatbreads with meat,

142
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,920
and two sausages full of food additives.

143
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,280
You have such a good memory that

144
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,110
you remembered everything I like to eat.

145
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,790
Do you have some other intentions towards me?

146
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,110
I...

147
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
Yes, my intention is that

148
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,590
you can argue less with me.

149
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,350
Okay?

150
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,070
Deal.

151
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,310
Can I add two tea eggs?

152
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,920
Copy that.

153
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,510
Jian, your clothes.

154
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,130
Say it again.

155
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,640
Jian.

156
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,750
Keep it.

157
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,720
Did the publisher reply?

158
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,070
Not yet.

159
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
They said it'll take them about a week.

160
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,520
Not that fast.

161
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,920
Maybe not.

162
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,830
Sometimes

163
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,460
they can reply quite fast.

164
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,830
I even know someone

165
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,230
who received the contract in just two days.

166
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,260
How about you check your email more often recently?

167
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,510
Fine.

168
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'll check whenever I'm available.

169
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,800
By the way,

170
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,270
I'll need to go out

171
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,130
after the meal.

172
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,480
For what?

173
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,920
The car was running out of gas yesterday.

174
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,320
I'll go to the repair shop

175
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,850
to add some engine oil.

176
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,680
OK. Come back early.

177
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,590
Uncle Li, are you serious?

178
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,640
Even if you didn't eat anything for three days,

179
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,270
you won't be eating like this.

180
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't worry.

181
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,720
I won't take your share for sure.

182
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm almost done.

183
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
The rest is all yours.

184
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,320
Don't you understand nothing?

185
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,120
This is an essential skill for field task.

186
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,400
It's just eating, what skill?

187
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,550
You can't fool people like this.

188
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,470
You don't believe me?

189
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,370
Let me tell you.

190
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,480
When Yang Guang and I got into Division Three,

191
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,550
Director Zhang took us for field work.

192
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,080
It was at a flatbread stall.

193
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,510
Two flatbreads for each one.

194
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,910
I watched Director Zhang

195
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,440
devour two flatbreads in three bites.

196
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,830
Only three bites.

197
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,090
He swallowed everything with just one gulp of water.

198
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,750
Yang Guang and I were wondering

199
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,400
what was going on here.

200
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,830
In half a minute,

201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,060
the suspect moved.

202
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,510
What should we do?

203
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,160
We had to tail him, which spanned two provinces.

204
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,110
It cost us three days and three nights.

205
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,640
We never rested for even one minute.

206
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,680
Right then, I regretted not eating a few more

207
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,640
bites of that flatbread, which'd be great.

208
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,960
So

209
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,590
our type of police work

210
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,650
is really different from the others.

211
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,680
We don't know when an operation'll end or

212
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
where it'll end, do you understand?

213
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,240
Understood.

214
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,720
You...

215
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
Don't choke. My goodness.

216
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,960
See?

217
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,680
Field work isn't easy, is it?

218
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,110
You are suitable for office work.

219
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,830
What do you mean?

220
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,070
Are you looking down on us who work in the office?

221
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,310
We don't look down on you people in office.

222
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,770
Field ops charge forward,

223
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,560
tech support backs us up, and both are essential.

224
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Let me tell you,

225
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,200
Uncle Li.

226
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,040
Just because you look down on me,

227
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,350
for defending our country,

228
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,750
I'll definitely master this eating drill!

229
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,830
Alright, chew it.

230
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,400
I beg you. Don't choke.

231
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm leaving.

232
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,640
Be careful.

233
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,150
I'll wait for you at home.

234
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,750
How does taking out the trash take you this long?

235
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,070
I ate so much.

236
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,480
So I need to get out to work out a bit.

237
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,510
Stomachache?

238
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,680
Essential stomach medicine, always prepared.

239
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,400
Thank you.

240
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I told you it's suitable for you to sit in the office.

241
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,690
Uncle Li,

242
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,750
to do field work, besides eating fast,

243
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,480
what other secret tricks do you have?

244
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,340
Can you tell me?

245
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,970
Secret tricks?

246
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,350
You...

247
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
You got me.

248
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,070
I...

249
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,550
I'm not a theoretical person.

250
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,310
I have no secret tricks.

251
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,640
Surveillance work is just a waiting game.

252
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,500
It's just about who cracks first.

253
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,610
Don't you always say I look older than

254
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,300
I really am?

255
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,350
Yeah, I admit that

256
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,750
my worn-out look comes from grinding work.

257
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,790
Strange.

258
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,160
Not at all.

259
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,160
I am talking about this taxi.

260
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,110
An empty car went in.

261
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,000
And it came out empty.

262
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,660
It did go down to the basement.

263
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,070
The order has been cancelled?

264
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,960
Impossible. There must be something wrong.

265
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,830
I'll follow it.

266
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,200
Don't act alone.

267
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
Call me if anything happens.

268
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,900
Be careful.

269
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,730
Don't worry.

270
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,480
Ms. Ma,

271
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,830
I just sent you a plate number.

272
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,830
Can you check its location for me?

273
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,960
It’s very critical.

274
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,960
I think it's related to Luca.

275
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,880
Roger.

276
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,030
Jian, I found it.

277
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,000
Someone did place an order online.

278
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,240
The destination is No. 31 Dongping Road.

279
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,880
Copy that.

280
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,160
Ms. Ma, help me check a car for me.

281
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,310
Black SUV, Yan YAG935.

282
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,920
Copy that.

283
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,030
[Start searching]

284
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,480
Jian, the target is on Qingdao Road,

285
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Fenghe Seafood.

286
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,480
Copy that.

287
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,030
Who are you?

288
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
What are you here for?

289
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Hello, is this your car?

290
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,790
If this is not my car,

291
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,120
then whose is it? Yours?

292
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,410
How long have you been parked here?

293
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,640
Who are you?

294
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,240
How long I've been parked here

295
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,640
is none of your business.

296
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
The whole store is mine.

297
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,830
I've stopped here for a day.

298
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,960
Did I get in your way?

299
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,680
I just like this car.

301
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,110
Sorry.

302
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,350
Ms. Ma, Ms. Ma.

303
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,920
The car obviously has a fake plate.

304
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,880
Relocate it.

305
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,750
Roger.

306
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,030
Hello.

307
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,310
Is it convenient to talk?

308
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,310
I want to meet you.

309
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,110
Last night, at James' house,

310
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,720
we all drank a lot.

311
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
I pretended to be drunk and left first.

312
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
Then I came back

313
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,110
and sneaked into James’s villa.

314
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,440
When I went in,

315
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,350
he was talking to someone

316
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,150
in the study on the second floor.

317
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,970
What did he say?

318
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,830
I recorded it.

319
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,170
I only heard one sentence clearly.

320
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,860
Get ready to pick up the goods.

321
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Pick up the goods?

322
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,550
What goods?

323
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
When to pick it up?

324
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm not sure about the details.

325
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,270
But I think

326
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,610
it should be related to their plan.

327
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,350
We need to find out as soon as possible.

328
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,750
Yanping keeps importing

329
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,550
a large number of goods every day.

330
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,480
If we don't have more detailed information,

331
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,680
it'll be hard for us to find it out.

332
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes.

333
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,480
I intended to

334
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,640
keep my relationship

335
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,170
with Zhao Yaning as we had planned,

336
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,750
so I can continue gathering information

337
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,960
about their plans

338
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,510
and schedule details.

339
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,680
Hit a small snag, though.

340
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,530
Did you cross the line?

341
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,070
No.

342
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,750
She slept at my place last night.

343
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,400
She used the excuse that she was worried I drank too much,

344
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,440
and she volunteered to come to my place.

345
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,350
After she came,

346
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,830
she was acting really strange the entire time.

347
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,160
I told her clearly

348
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,830
to go back first,

349
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,890
but she refused.

350
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,160
Then she found the alcohol herself,

351
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,830
drinking until she was wasted.

352
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,290
Throughout this process,

353
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,370
she also said something strange.

354
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,610
After I sent her away this morning,

355
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,440
I went to the surveillance room in the community.

356
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,160
Last night, I noticed Zhao Yaning

357
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
was accompanied by Taylor from her company,

358
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,420
and he had been tailing her

359
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,480
the whole way.

360
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,440
Jian, one minute ago,

361
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,500
a black BESTUNE car

362
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,550
drove into the parking lot at Binjiang Pier.

363
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,590
The licence plate didn't match,

364
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,640
but the vehicle model and exterior features closely

365
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,960
resemble the car you're looking for.

366
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,590
Send me the exact location now,

367
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,390
and ask Tan to come and pick me up.

368
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,960
Roger.

369
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,650
Get ready to go.

370
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,159
Total distance covered: 3.5 kilometers.

371
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,190
Leader has serious doubts about you.

372
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,840
He wants Zhao Yaning to do the honeytrap mission perfectly,

373
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,400
but worries she might defy orders.

374
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
That's why he assigned Taylor to watch her.

375
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,600
But according to your analysis,

376
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,760
it suggests Leader and Zhao Yaning

377
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,560
aren't exactly in perfect alignment either.

378
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,670
Zhao Yaning last night used the alcohol

379
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,600
as courage to say

380
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,690
she was exhausted,

381
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,560
completely worn out.

382
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,960
That suggests there might be

383
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,469
internal conflicts among them.

384
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,070
This is good for us.

385
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,070
Does this mean

386
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,720
I could potentially turn Zhao Yaning?

387
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,150
If I succeed,

388
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,150
it's like burying a nail

389
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,500
in Leader's heart.

390
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,880
No.

391
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,190
This plan offers high rewards

392
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,760
but carries equally high risks.

393
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,760
The enemy does whatever it takes

394
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,020
and has no bottom line.

395
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,960
We must

396
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,410
uphold our principles and bottom lines.

397
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,460
Your idea to turn her is sound,

398
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,230
but

399
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,620
only if executed when the timing is ripe.

400
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,090
How about this?

401
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,610
Just follow her rhythm now

402
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,230
and keep your current state.

403
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,910
Don't cross the line.

404
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,880
Keep an eye on her for more time.

405
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,840
Okay.

406
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,880
People

407
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,550
are emotional creatures after all.

408
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
It's natural

409
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,050
to develop feelings

410
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,480
after spending time together.

411
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Moreover, superficially at least,

412
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,360
she's an exceptionally accomplished woman.

413
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,220
But I still need to remind you that

414
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
you should remember your identity.

415
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,880
You always need to maintain precise boundaries.

416
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,550
I will.

417
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,330
Don't look back.

418
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,870
There's a rat.

419
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,960
Mentor.

420
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,650
Go after that car ahead!

421
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,400
Jian.

422
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,030
The BESTUNE with the plate number of Yan 8700

423
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,150
might also have fake plates too.

424
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,280
The original car has been parked in the

425
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,880
parking lot of Yanping Airport for three days.

426
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,710
One mission with two plates.

427
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,840
They're so well prepared?
