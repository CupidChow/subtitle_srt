1
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,950
Zhao Yaning, Vice President of the Leader Group.

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,509
How do you pronounce your English name?

3
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,120
Alethea.

4
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,000
Alethea.

5
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:47,890
Okay, okay.

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,750
I'm Sonny.

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,120
Sonny.

8
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,880
Nice to meet you.

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,000
Nice to meet you too, Mr. Yang.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
If there are any business cooperation

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,340
opportunities in the future,

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,480
feel free to give me a call.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,010
Alright.

14
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,900
I'll take my leave now.

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,330
Okay, bye, Ms. Zhao.

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,740
Goodbye, Mr. Yang.

17
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,120
You exchanged business cards with Zhao Yaning?

18
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,050
Where did you run into her?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,130
Early this morning,

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,970
I went to visit Mr. Sun's grave.

21
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,990
She happened to be there as well.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,470
She went to visit Mr. Sun?

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,910
Judging by the way she paid her respects,

24
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,370
she seemed quite sincere.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,490
So I spontaneously decided

26
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,990
to approach her directly

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,120
to see how she would react upon seeing me.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,450
Then, how did she react?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,930
She firmly insisted that she had never met me before.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,620
She was clearly playing dumb with me.

31
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,760
Judging by her reaction today,

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm even more certain

33
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,010
she's someone with a hidden background.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,310
J.

35
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,160
You wanted to see me?

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,180
Have a seat.

37
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,840
Ms. Zhao,

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,079
how's your contact

39
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,079
with the Moss Trading Group going?

40
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,680
We've been keeping in touch.

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,910
I've heard some

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,250
news about nuclear power companies.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,780
It's getting cold. Would you like a bite?

44
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,080
I cracked it.

45
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,470
That fast?

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
What did you find?

47
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,470
AI helped cross-check the access logs

48
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,670
and found the source.

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,360
On the day Mr. Sun collapsed,

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,090
Mr. Ou and I checked the laptop.

51
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,190
We identified a total of three access records.

52
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,080
One at 1:37 PM,

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,750
another at 2:17 PM,

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,480
and a third at 3:33 PM.

55
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,160
But now this laptop shows

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,310
an additional access record

57
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,360
from that day at 4:05 PM,

58
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
lasting 1 minute and 32 seconds.

59
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,600
From the traces left

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,830
on this laptop now,

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,650
someone definitely performed a copy operation.

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
4:05 PM?

63
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,270
The vehicle transporting the laptop

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,510
left

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,750
the National Convention Center at 3:52 PM

66
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,950
and arrived at Division Three at 4:48 PM.

67
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,070
So at 4:05 PM,

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,390
the vehicle was still on the road.

69
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,159
So, this illegal copy operation

70
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,560
was a remote copy, right?

71
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,280
Correct.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
That matches what Section Chief Li said.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Section Chief Li?

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,510
You all knew already?

75
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,370
We speculated.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Looks like I came at a bad time.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,520
Right.

78
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,010
Get inside quickly and shut the door.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
We can't let a fifth person know.

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,650
It's a sixth now.

81
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,950
What's all this about the fifth or sixth?

82
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,110
You've come at the right time.

83
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,570
We have a major discovery.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,780
Remember that day on the rooftop,

85
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,680
you told me

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,230
that you suspected the laptop had been

87
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,560
illegally accessed during transport?

88
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Yes.

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,240
With Director Zhang's authorization,

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,190
Tian thoroughly investigated

91
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,510
Mr. Sun's laptop.

92
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,390
After two nights of hard work,

93
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,320
she made a significant discovery.

94
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,800
That very afternoon,

95
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,950
at 4:05 PM,

96
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,560
Mr. Sun's laptop

97
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,430
was remotely accessed, and data was illegally copied.

98
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,750
The car with the license plate Yan A88661

99
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,560
likely carried the person

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,490
who executed the illegal copying.

101
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,950
See?

102
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,190
I was right!

103
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,390
Otherwise, there's no other explanation!

104
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,120
Are you familiar with the technology involved?

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Not at the moment.

106
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,830
First thing tomorrow morning,

107
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,950
you and Section Chief Chen should

108
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,310
dig into the technical details.

109
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,630
Yes.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,190
Impressive.

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
What did you want to see me about?

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
I ordered two bowls of wontons.

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,170
I can't eat them all.

114
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,510
No, it's fine.

115
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,510
Let's share them.

116
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,190
After these days of investigation,

117
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,990
the case has become quite clear.

118
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,920
The illegal remote copying

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,720
occurred during

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,250
the transfer of the laptop.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,510
This vehicle with hazard lights on...

122
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,240
is Section Chief Li's team's vehicle for transporting the laptop.

123
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,720
This black sedan at the end,

124
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,900
with the license plate 88661,

125
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,770
is the suspect's vehicle.

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
These past few days, Tan

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
has been continuously

128
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,270
investigating this vehicle.

129
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,360
Tell us what you've found.

130
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
This suspect vehicle

131
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,800
belongs to Qianlida Car Rental Company.

132
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,750
The renter is

133
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,000
an ordinary retired female worker surnamed Liu.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,120
However, she herself claims

135
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,630
that she's never rented a car.

136
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,950
Based on her reaction,

137
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,500
I believe she's not lying.

138
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,360
But according to

139
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,680
the rental company's records,

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,880
that suspect vehicle

141
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,560
was indeed rented using

142
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,870
Ms. Liu's ID card.

143
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,390
This indicates

144
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,190
that someone has stolen

145
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,120
Ms. Liu's ID card

146
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,240
and used it to rent that suspect vehicle.

147
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,430
So what happened?

148
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,430
Did she lose her ID card before?

149
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,310
No, she didn't.

150
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
And Ms. Liu

151
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,630
has always kept it

152
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,610
very carefully.

153
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,270
But after my repeated inquiries,

154
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,430
Ms. Liu recalled

155
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,360
that during that period,

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,630
there was only one time when her ID card left her possession.

157
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,760
That was on the 17th,

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
when the travel agency

159
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,750
helped Ms. Liu

160
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,800
book her flight tickets and hotel.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,870
The travel agency took

162
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,270
her ID card for two hours.

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
The car rental records show

164
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,100
that the car was

165
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,750
rented within that exact two-hour window.

166
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,120
So my conclusion is

167
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,830
that the problem started

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
at the travel agency.

169
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,950
Have you found out who handled the ID card?

170
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,390
Yes.

171
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,630
The tour guide from the travel agency,

172
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,560
Pang Shuqin.

173
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,880
Here's her profile.

174
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,080
Mr. Zhang,

175
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,750
don't go, please don't leave.

176
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,920
Listen, don't go.

177
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,870
Ms. Hong!

178
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,000
Listen to me,

179
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,390
at our age,

180
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,750
after all the hardships we endured when we were young,

181
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,410
it's time for us to enjoy life!

182
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,290
And spend money on ourselves!

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,660
Look at them...

184
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
Young man!

185
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,750
Young man.

186
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,310
Let me tell you something.

187
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,510
Are you here to check out

188
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,110
our senior travel packages?

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,510
To give your parents

190
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
a surprise

191
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,200
and let them go on a trip?

192
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,510
Mrs. Pang, right?

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,210
Yes, I am.

194
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,270
-Let's sit down and talk.
-You know me?

195
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,040
Let's sit down and talk.

196
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Sit down and talk? Okay, okay!

197
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,870
Let's have a seat, come on.

198
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,950
Come on, sit, sit, sit.

199
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,310
You must be referrals

200
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,830
from my previous clients, right?

201
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,430
Well then,

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,510
I'll

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,430
give you

204
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,580
a 20% discount.

205
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,490
Mrs. Pang, it's like this.

206
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,590
When you organized group tours,

207
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,750
you privately lent out other people's ID cards.

208
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,510
Is that true?

209
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,240
Well...

210
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,970
how do you know that?

211
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,270
This is what we do.

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,510
Oh.

213
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,520
It's just lending out ID cards.

214
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,540
Is it really that serious?

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,360
I advise you to tell us everything,

216
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,820
honestly and completely.

217
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,870
If you cooperate, we can consider being lenient.

218
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,720
If you hide anything from us,

219
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,440
things will get much worse for you.

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Mrs. Pang,

221
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,760
don't worry.

222
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,510
Just tell us the truth,

223
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,160
alright?

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,880
I'll tell you.

225
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,060
I'll tell you everything.

226
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
In the past,

227
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,030
I worked as a cleaner.

228
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,550
The boss of our company

229
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,550
was very kind to me.

230
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,390
He often

231
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,270
bought me food

232
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
and drinks.

233
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,410
There was a time

234
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,240
when we were chatting together,

235
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,600
and he told me

236
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,150
that he often needed to rent cars.

237
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,080
He

238
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,320
is a foreigner,

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,390
and renting a car with a passport

240
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,850
can be quite troublesome.

241
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,120
So he asked me

242
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,060
to help him out.

243
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,790
I thought

244
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,790
it wasn't a big deal,

245
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,320
so I lent him

246
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,270
my ID card.

247
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,670
Altogether,

248
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,850
I lent it to him three times.

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,870
I see.

250
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,550
So, what's the name

251
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,790
of this company?

252
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,200
It's called... Muse.

253
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,390
No, not it.

254
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,320
It's Moss...

255
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,840
Moss Trading Group.

256
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,680
What's the name of the boss?

257
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,630
Mr. Charlie.

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Mrs. Pang.

259
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,900
Is this the person?

260
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,670
Charlie,

262
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,880
Mr. Charlie.

263
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,080
That's him.

264
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,510
Got it.

265
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,390
Mrs. Pang,

266
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,900
I want to remind you

267
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
to never lend your ID card

268
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,510
to anyone for use in the future again,

269
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,080
okay?

270
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,550
I understand.

271
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,550
Thank you very much

272
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,840
for the information you provided today.

273
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,480
It's

274
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,680
very important to us.

275
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,670
Here's my card with my phone number.

276
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,600
If Mr. Charlie contacts you again,

277
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,960
please make sure to call us.

278
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,150
Also, please do not tell anyone

279
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,790
about today's conversation.

280
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,390
Thank you.

281
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,490
Goodbye.

282
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,550
Goodbye, Auntie.

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,800
How was it?

284
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,670
Would that performance just now work, Master Jian?

285
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,930
Don't sound so street.

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
Mentor, then.

287
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
It sounds better.

288
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,350
The remote illegal data copy

289
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,920
is definitely tied to

290
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,390
this Duke guy

291
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,870
and the Moss Trading Group.

292
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,480
The previous murder of Mr. Sun

293
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
was most likely their doing as well.

294
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,030
Therefore,

295
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,550
our next task

296
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,360
is to launch a comprehensive

297
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,820
investigation into the Moss Trading Group.

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,390
Ladies and gentlemen, experts and directors,

299
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,720
thank you for attending this conference.

300
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
I'd like to officially announce

301
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
that the Zhounan Power Plant has mastered

302
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,150
all HTGR technologies.

303
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,600
After conquering all challenges,

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,670
Zhounan now has the Gen-4 nuclear technology.

305
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,240
Two weeks ago,

306
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,270
China made an announcement

307
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,030
of HTGR technologies.

308
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,670
Zhounan had never

309
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,630
announced any progress before.

310
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,030
Yet, now,

311
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,290
you have mastered all key technologies.

312
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,240
Were these two events related at all?

313
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,870
Nuclear power is created from the base reaction of nuclear fission.

314
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,840
In 2000, experts around the globe

315
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,510
confirmed six types of Gen-4 nuclear reactors.

316
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,550
They publicized

317
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,280
this information soon enough.

318
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,550
HTGR was one of the six types.

319
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,510
Its basic principles were fully disclosed.

320
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,480
Will you have a

321
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,340
technical presentation as well?

322
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,630
There is nothing in the pipeline so far.

323
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,150
So,

324
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,390
did you not reference China's work

325
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,080
on the nuclear power reaction technology?

326
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,240
HTGR

327
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,440
uses helium

328
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
for core cooling and heat transfer.

329
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,630
And a decade ago,

330
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,270
we completed

331
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,870
a small-scale laboratory validation long before China did.

332
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,670
We just never announced it.

333
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,270
Mr. Sun optimized the reaction

334
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,780
and process for high-temperature cooling,

335
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,720
which boosted the raw material utilization ratio.

336
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,600
But he is not the person who invented the HTGRs.

337
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,190
So, for the record, we had nothing to reference, even if we wanted to.

338
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Does it mean

339
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
that you're still using the most basic reactor model?

340
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,080
We have our reasons

341
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
for keeping our technology private at the moment.

342
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,510
However, on behalf of Zhounan Power Plant,

343
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,240
I'd like to announce

344
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
that we have already begun

345
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,270
negotiations with the renowned energy company, Capital City.

346
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,960
We hope they are proven fruitful.

347
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,840
We also welcome all cooperation

348
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,120
from around the globe.

349
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,520
This concludes our press conference.

350
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,000
Thank you all for your time.

351
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,390
Mr. Henry,

352
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,110
I saw the news.

353
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,070
According to my sources,

354
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,510
China's Huaze Group

355
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,390
has been privately involved

356
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,840
with the Capital City.

357
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,080
So we've decided to join the game

358
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,960
and seize the advantage.

359
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,960
The rest is up to you now.

360
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,360
How long?

361
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,550
One month.

362
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,920
I understood.

363
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,870
J,

364
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
you've seen the news, right?

365
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,200
The Zhounan Power Plant

366
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
has just announced

367
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,790
that they have mastered the key technologies

368
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,870
of HTGRs.

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
They also announced

370
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,030
that they have started negotiations

371
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,150
with Capital City Energy Company.

372
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,550
Is the Moss Trading Group

373
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,000
still the operator of the Zhounan Power Plant?

374
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes.

375
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,120
Have we signed a contract

376
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,840
with Moss Trading Group yet?

377
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,240
Not yet.

378
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,370
But don't worry.

379
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,870
Sander and I

380
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,630
are already reviewing the contract.

381
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,600
We'll officially sign it in three days.

382
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,510
I knew it.

383
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,600
You would never

384
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,630
let me down.

385
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
We've

386
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,840
lost the initiative.

387
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,910
The longer we drag this out,

388
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,440
the more passive we become.

389
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,670
I understand.

390
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,330
Understood.

391
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
Please rest assured, sir.

392
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,960
We'll find out the truth as soon as possible.

393
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,390
Yes.

394
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,360
Come in.

395
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,670
Have you seen the news about

396
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,070
the Zhounan Power Plant?

397
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,720
The department just called

398
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,180
about this matter as well.

399
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,790
I'm a bit

400
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,380
confused about it.

401
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
I'd like to ask for your help in sorting out my thoughts.

402
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,510
Mr. Sun told me before

403
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,120
that the R&D progress at Zhounan Power Plant

404
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,580
had always been very slow.

405
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,240
Among the companies

406
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,120
developing 4th-generation technology

407
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,080
in the world,

408
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,440
they were considered to be lagging behind.

409
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,480
How did they suddenly announce

410
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,240
that they've mastered the technologies?

411
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,360
Also, according to our recent

412
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,290
investigation,

413
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,570
Moss Trading Group

414
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,240
is one of the shareholders

415
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,500
of Zhounan Power Plant

416
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,030
and also the actual operator

417
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,910
of its project.

418
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,170
At the same time,

419
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,750
they are also the masterminds behind

420
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,750
the illegal copying of Mr. Sun's data from his laptop.

421
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Isn't that interesting?

422
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
So the technologies of Zhounan Power Plant...

423
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
come from that illegal copying.

424
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,550
Chen Qiu speculates

425
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,150
that the content they copied

426
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,010
doesn't exceed 20% at most.

427
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,960
You mean,

428
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,200
the Zhounan Power Plant

429
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,440
may not actually have mastered

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,030
the 4th-generation technology?

431
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,630
That's most likely the case.

432
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,260
But I still don't understand.

433
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,960
Why would

434
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,690
they do this?

435
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,910
Clearly, they haven't mastered it,

436
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,310
yet they claim they have.

437
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,770
Taking such a big risk.

438
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,200
Their purpose is very obvious.

439
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,060
That is to delay

440
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,240
the cooperation between Huaze Group

441
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,100
and Capital City Energy Company.

442
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,270
They're making a preemptive move.

443
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,150
To put it bluntly,

444
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,480
they're just staking a claim.

445
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,320
But doing this

446
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,020
is like starting a countdown.

447
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,910
They've also backed themselves into a corner.

448
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,910
If following your line of thinking,

449
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,250
they indeed don't have much time left.

450
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,480
They must quickly

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,740
obtain the 4th-generation technology.

452
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
So I'd like to request

453
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,440
to conduct comprehensive monitoring

454
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,700
on Moss Trading Group.

455
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,160
What we have now

456
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,660
are all peripheral clues.

457
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,720
Moss Trading Group

458
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
is a foreign company.

459
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,880
Implementing full monitoring on it

460
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,349
could easily cause a lot of trouble.

461
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,270
Here's what we'll do:

462
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,589
you should continue to lead your team

463
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,069
to investigate discreetly.

464
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,000
Keep a low profile.

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,070
Don't alert them.

466
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,510
But you need to quickly get to the bottom

467
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,310
of their true purpose and plans.

468
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,170
Yes, sir.

469
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
For us,

470
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,840
we're on a countdown too.

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,160
Let's wish ourselves the best of luck

472
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,460
for the upcoming work.

473
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,790
Thank you very much.

474
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,790
Since we began our in-depth investigation

475
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,390
into the Moss Trading Group,

476
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,200
there's one person

477
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,530
who has caught our particular attention.

478
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,000
Herman,

479
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,850
a Swiss citizen.

480
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
He's currently 71 years old,

481
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,750
a former chief engineer

482
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,830
at the NGS Pharmaceutical Research Institute.

483
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,230
He retired six years ago.

484
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,160
On April 18th at 18:20,

485
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
a white Honda commercial vehicle

486
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
drove out of Moss Trading Group.

487
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,440
This vehicle

488
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,100
eventually stopped at the airport parking lot.

489
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,270
After Sherry got out of the car,

490
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,720
she headed straight to the arrivals gate,

491
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,920
where she picked up an elderly, white-haired man.

492
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,070
This white-haired elderly man was Herman.

493
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,830
Then Sherry and Herman got into the car

494
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,030
and returned to the Moss Trading Group.

495
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,400
Herman flew from Switzerland

496
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,680
to Jiangcheng on April 15th.

497
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,270
On April 18th,

498
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,510
he flew from Jiangcheng to Yanping.

499
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,310
Two days later,

500
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,970
Mr. Sun died of a heart attack.

501
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,400
A heart medication expert

502
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,830
traveled across several cities

503
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,160
and arrived in Yanping.

504
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,110
Two days later,

505
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,770
Mr. Sun died of a heart attack.

506
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,740
That's too much of a coincidence.

507
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,750
What kind of pharmaceutical company

508
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,440
is this NGS specifically?

509
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,590
NGS is a pharmaceutical company

510
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,310
that has recently emerged in East Asia.

511
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,480
Its production and sales volume

512
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,070
are not at the level of industry giants,

513
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,240
but with its strong R&D capabilities,

514
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,200
it has developed many

515
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,270
effective medications for internal diseases.

516
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,270
It's made particularly outstanding inventions

517
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,200
in the treatment of heart disease.

518
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,400
Their most famous medicine is

519
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,640
AR, developed by Herman.

520
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,920
He innovatively extracts steroidal saponins

521
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,550
from medicinal plants,

522
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,200
which are hailed as a healthier aspirin.

523
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,540
Heart disease.

524
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
This Herman

525
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,000
must be connected

526
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,330
to Mr. Sun's poisoning.

527
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,680
Arrange for someone immediately

528
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,550
to put Herman

529
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,030
under 24-hour surveillance.

530
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,760
Understood.

531
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,640
Division Director Yang, there's one more thing:

532
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,440
Herman has already left Yanping

533
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,640
and returned to Zurich, Switzerland.

534
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,270
He sure ran fast, huh?

535
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,070
Continue to dig deeper into this Herman.

536
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,680
Understood.

537
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,810
Section Chief Chen.

538
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,960
Take your team

539
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
and carefully go through

540
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,790
Herman's entire itinerary

541
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,390
since he arrived in Yanping.

542
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,280
Understood.

543
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,240
Division Director Yang,

544
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,920
last time you asked me to do a deeper investigation

545
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,680
into Herman's whereabouts after entering the country.

546
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,400
I've reviewed the report written by the previous investigators

547
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,750
about Herman's movements after entering the country.

548
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,150
The report shows that...

549
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,310
on the day of the nuclear energy conference,

550
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,350
Herman, accompanied by Sherry,

551
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,240
rode in a white Honda commercial vehicle.

552
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,480
After leaving the Moss Trading Group,

553
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
they visited two locations in the morning:

554
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,720
the International Trade Center and the Agricultural Exhibition Hall.

555
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,070
However, after careful investigation,

556
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,400
I discovered that they had missed one location:

557
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,600
Huasong Restaurant.

558
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,290
Here's what happened.

559
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,750
Since Huasong Restaurant

560
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,030
is a place that Mr. Sun frequently visits,

561
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,510
I conducted a re-examination

562
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,590
of that restaurant

563
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,270
and found

564
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,680
that the surveillance cameras at

565
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,400
the main entrance and in the parking lot

566
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,310
were broken.

567
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,280
This raised my suspicions.

568
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,160
So,

569
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,550
I checked some nearby cameras

570
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,070
and discovered

571
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,000
that an internal camera in the Chinese restaurant

572
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
next to Huasong,

573
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,400
through the restaurant's glass window,

574
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,750
could just barely capture the parking lot

575
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,000
and the main entrance of Huasong.

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,660
Therefore,

577
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,990
I checked the footage from that camera.

578
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,310
I discovered

579
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,310
that on April 20th,

580
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,200
the day of the nuclear energy conference,

581
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,810
at 11:15 in the morning,

582
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,420
Mr. Sun walked into Huasong Restaurant.

583
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,790
At 11:25 AM,

584
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,880
the white Honda commercial vehicle

585
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,350
from Moss Trading Group

586
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,650
also arrived at the parking lot of Huasong Restaurant.

587
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,680
Then,

588
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,920
Sherry and Herman entered the restaurant.

589
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,680
At 11:35 AM,

590
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,240
Sherry and Herman left the restaurant

591
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,510
and drove away.

592
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
At 11:45 AM,

593
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,000
ten minutes after Sherry

594
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,270
and Herman left Huasong Restaurant,

595
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,600
Mr. Sun also walked out of the restaurant.

596
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,720
Well,

597
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,200
what can this prove?

598
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,400
The poisoning

599
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,790
happened several hours later, right?

600
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,240
Even if they had been in the same place,

601
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,370
what could it prove?

602
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,480
Regardless,

603
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,880
Chen Qiu's discovery is very important.

604
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
This Huasong Restaurant

605
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,110
deserves our close attention.

606
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,830
On the day of the conference,

607
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,030
Mr. Sun and Herman

608
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,720
were both present at that restaurant.

609
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,680
Whether it was by coincidence

610
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,080
or for some other reason,

611
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,080
we need to conduct a thorough

612
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,960
and detailed investigation

613
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,090
of this restaurant.

614
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,880
Hello, sir.

615
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,680
We're not open for business at this time.

616
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Hello.

617
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,010
Please cooperate with us.

618
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,880
Are there only two of you in the restaurant now?

619
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,160
There are also chefs working in the kitchen.

620
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Is the owner here?

621
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
The owner is not here.

622
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,830
Please call the owner

623
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,550
and ask him to come back to cooperate with our investigation.

624
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,010
I'm sorry, but I don't have his phone number.

625
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,150
Then please try to remember:

626
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,720
were you working

627
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,750
at noon on April 20th?

628
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,000
I... I don't recall clearly.

629
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,250
Please recall carefully.

630
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,210
Is he from your restaurant?

631
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes.

632
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,110
Yes.

633
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,830
I know.

634
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,320
After him!

635
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,830
Li Jian!

636
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,440
Li Jian!

637
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,310
Around 4 PM today,

638
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,480
at the intersection of Guangliang Street

639
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,880
in the Chaoyang District, a traffic accident occurred.

640
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,440
A white sedan collided with

641
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,810
a large truck traveling from west to east,

642
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,790
causing an explosion.

643
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,720
The cause is still unknown

644
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,030
and is under investigation.

645
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,030
One died and one was injured at the scene.

646
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,960
We will continue to report on this.

647
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,270
Did you did a thorough job?

648
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,550
The phone number can be tracked.

649
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,790
And we've been meeting without cameras.

650
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,240
I've also covered our tracks at his house.

651
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,000
Sir.

652
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,200
With the Chinese Ministry of State Security

653
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,730
monitoring our every move,

654
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,400
it's hard to do anything.

655
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,270
We don't have time.

656
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
We need to keep the Whale to go ahead.

657
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,010
The Whale is your ace. I'll persuade them.

658
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,310
The man who fled by car and died in the crash was Wu De.

659
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,510
He was the owner of Huasong Restaurant.

660
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,480
The accident scene investigation has been completed.

661
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,030
All physical evidence has been collected

662
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,510
and is being processed.

663
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,480
At the same time, we are

664
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,750
also investigating Wu De's residence.

665
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Weijian worked overnight to repair

666
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Wu De's phone

667
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,510
and recover part of the data.

668
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,310
Among them, we found this photo.

669
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,790
This photo was taken when Li Jian

670
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,590
and I first followed Zhao Yaning

671
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,270
at the Western restaurant in the Zhanshan Hotel.

672
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,160
That noon,

673
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,750
Zhao Yaning and Sander Bowie

674
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
met there.

675
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,890
Turns out, they had already...

676
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,160
noticed us at that time.

677
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,310
Any findings from Wu De's place?

678
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,240
No leads related to the intelligence

679
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,720
have been found so far.

680
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,640
Got it.

681
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,110
This is the Western restaurant at Zhanshan Hotel.

682
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,040
Your mentor and I

683
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,750
were secretly photographed there.

684
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,950
Go there immediately

685
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,790
and retrieve the surveillance footage from April 11th,

686
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,050
focusing on the period

687
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,790
between 12 PM and 1 PM.

688
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,690
Find the person who took the secret photo for me.

689
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,830
Zoom in.

690
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,350
Sure enough, this photo was taken by Duke.

691
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,110
This proves

692
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,030
that Wu De, the owner of Huasong Restaurant,

693
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,360
had a direct connection

694
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,640
to the Moss Trading Group.

695
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,750
Division Director Yang,

696
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,680
the evidence is conclusive.

697
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,640
Let's arrest him directly.

698
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,350
Not yet.

699
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,240
We're not just going after Duke,

700
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,210
but also Moss Trading Group

701
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
and the forces behind it.

702
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,920
The evidence we have now

703
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,500
can only convict Duke.

704
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,270
But we need to uncover

705
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,750
Moss Trading Group's

706
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,340
real plan behind all this.

707
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,590
So from now on,

708
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,160
we'll put Sander Bowie and Duke

709
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,900
under 24-hour surveillance.

710
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,110
You take one team,

711
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,920
and you take another.

712
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,780
Work in shifts.

713
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,270
Your Information Department and Network Technology Department

714
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,640
will provide intelligence support.

715
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,840
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

716
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,510
Sir.

717
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,020
I was followed.

718
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,750
Stay calm.

719
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
I was too.

720
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,830
If these guys are bored, wanna a little tour,

721
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm happy to be the guide.

722
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,680
Alright.

723
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,040
Division Director Yang.

724
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,960
Duke's been either shopping or playing around today.

725
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,030
And this guy,

726
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,720
he likes to buy two identical pieces when shopping for clothes.

727
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,780
He's been at the gym

728
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,270
for almost an hour now.

729
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,270
Their counter-surveillance skills are strong.

730
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,800
Don't underestimate them.

731
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,690
Stick close.

732
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,790
Got it.

733
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,630
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

734
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,960
On this warm afternoon,

735
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,630
let us focus sincerely

736
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,070
on a face-to-face spiritual communication

737
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,510
with the avant-garde writer, Mr. Luca Mori.

738
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,670
Let's immerse ourselves in

739
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,630
Mr. Luca's literary world.

740
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,510
First, allow me to introduce

741
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,000
our distinguished guests here today.

742
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,060
The avant-garde, heartwarming writer, Mr. Luca Mori.

743
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,710
Next to him is the excellent young translator

744
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,800
who is also the translation collaborator

745
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,440
for his work this time,

746
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,760
the talented Ms. Xie Xiaoman.

747
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,630
Mr. Luca specifically asked me

748
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,880
to give a special introduction

749
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
for his best reader,

750
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,260
also his close friend,

751
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,280
the president of Moss Trading Group,

752
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,550
Mr. Sander Bowie.

753
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,510
Lastly, let me introduce

754
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,190
Mr. Luca's good friend from China,

755
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,440
the Vice President of the Greater China region

756
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,920
of Leader PR Company,

757
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,070
Ms. Zhao Yaning.

758
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,760
Welcome.

759
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,920
Well, without further ado,

760
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,960
let's give a warm round of applause

761
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,190
to our avant-garde writer, Mr. Luca Mori,

762
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,400
and let him share with us

763
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,360
his feelings after coming to China

764
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,150
and meeting Chinese readers.

765
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,290
Let's welcome him.

766
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,930
Ask Director Qu to come here for a moment.

767
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,400
You found something?

768
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,260
An abnormal issue was discovered

769
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,320
during the re-examination of Mr. Sun's blood sample.

770
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,920
He's driving, so he can't drink.

771
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,360
Could you please bring a glass of juice?

772
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,800
Okay.

773
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,480
Thank you.

774
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,840
Are you also here for the readers' meeting?

775
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,440
Yes.

776
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,480
Mr. Sander.

777
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,280
May I ask you a few questions?

778
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,670
Of course.

779
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,340
Let's go somewhere quiet.

780
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,860
Please.

781
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,720
This way.

782
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,610
Please.

783
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,560
Is this lighting

784
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,230
okay?

785
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,370
Certainly.

786
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,280
You've been a powerhouse

787
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,410
in the business world for years...

788
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,670
Sonny.

789
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,960
Alethea.

790
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,880
How are you?

791
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,920
Fine, thank you. And you?

792
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,710
I'm fine too, thank you.

793
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,060
Here's to Li Lei and Han Meimei from those years.

794
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,440
You people in business

795
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,900
are also interested in foreign literature?

796
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,460
To be honest, I know nothing about it.

797
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
But the Chinese translator of this book

798
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,120
is my neighbor

799
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,960
and also my sports buddy.

800
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,360
So I came to show my support.

801
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,490
What a coincidence.

802
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,480
Even more coincidental

803
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,800
to bump into you here.

804
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,520
It's fate.

805
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,550
The introduction just now mentioned

806
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,630
that you and Mr. Luca

807
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,630
are good friends.

808
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,630
I introduced

809
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,230
Miss Xie Xiaoman, the translator, to Mr. Luca.

810
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,510
So I'd like to interview you.

811
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,240
Why did you choose my neighbor,

812
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,070
my sports buddy,

813
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,400
to translate this book?

814
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,970
It wasn't me who chose her.

815
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,590
It was Miss Xie Xiaoman's talent

816
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,590
that won Mr. Luca's appreciation.

817
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,070
As for me,

818
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,110
I merely accepted the commission

819
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,760
and completed the task.

820
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,510
That's all.

821
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,840
So, as the Vice President of such a

822
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,280
large multinational PR company,

823
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,070
you wouldn't pass up

824
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,600
even such a small business?

825
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,800
A truly professional PR company

826
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
often prioritizes

827
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,440
client needs

828
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,240
over profits.

829
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,550
Oh, right,

830
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,590
you people in business

831
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,440
always

832
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,040
put profit first, don't you?

833
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,360
There are no permanent friends,

834
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,890
only permanent interests.

835
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,760
So, is your relationship

836
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,480
with Mr. Sander based on

837
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,230
interests or friendship?

838
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,710
It's a cooperative relationship.

839
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,150
I see.

840
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,920
Excuse me for a moment.

841
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,360
Okay.

842
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,220
Please come in.

843
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,520
You wanted to see me? What's the matter?

844
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,690
Director Qu, you're here too.

845
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,530
What we're about to discuss...

846
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,020
stays between the three of us.

847
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,850
Director Qu, please go ahead.

848
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,230
Okay.

849
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,520
After repeated laboratory tests,

850
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,070
I have confirmed

851
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
that Mr. Sun's death

852
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,440
was not due to a sudden myocardial infarction

853
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,840
but was caused by a toxin.

854
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,150
This toxin

855
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,840
is not an ordinary poison

856
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,030
but rather a variant of TTX toxin

857
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,760
extracted from pufferfish.

858
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,070
Due to this toxin's unique alkaloid properties,

859
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,230
it evaded detection

860
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,610
during the first round of blood tests.

861
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,230
TTX toxin?

862
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,880
The pufferfish toxin TTX is an alkaloid

863
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
and one of the most potent

864
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,190
neurotoxins found

865
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,590
in nature.

866
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,110
Just 0.5 milligrams can be lethal.

867
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,760
Victims of pufferfish poisoning

868
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,160
typically show symptoms

869
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
within 10

870
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,150
to 45 minutes

871
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,770
after consuming pufferfish,

872
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,880
though in some cases, the onset

873
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,070
can be delayed for up to three hours.

874
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,960
This is a characteristic of natural toxins.

875
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,000
Since this toxin can block

876
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,920
signal transmission between human nerves

877
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,400
and regulate blood flow, which would be impossible

878
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
to control during sudden cardiac arrest,

879
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,930
it holds immense potential

880
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,920
to deliver unprecedented

881
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,960
therapeutic effects in the treatment

882
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,820
of heart disease if successfully

883
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,000
developed into a medication.

884
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,510
However, if this toxin

885
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,630
is developed as a poison,

886
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,320
its natural delayed action

887
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,710
could be exploited

888
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,230
to control the onset time of poisoning.

889
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,070
In other words,

890
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,130
it could cause the victims

891
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,790
to show symptoms hours after taking it.

892
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,590
This appears to be the case with Mr. Sun.

893
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,150
That is to say,

894
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,800
Mr. Sun had already been poisoned...

895
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,320
before entering the conference center.

896
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,180
Based on the information we have,

897
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,080
Mr. Sun appeared at Huasong Restaurant

898
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,760
with Hermann four hours

899
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,440
before the onset of symptoms.

900
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,100
Then it wasn't a coincidence.

901
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,410
Huasong Restaurant

902
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,230
is very likely the location

903
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,830
where they poisoned Mr. Sun.

904
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,810
Hello, welcome.

905
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,630
How many in your party?

906
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,150
This way, please.
