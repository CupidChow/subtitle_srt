1
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,789
The technology that drives the rear wheels

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,920
between the two rear wheels

3
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,950
makes the operation of the dump truck more reliable and powerful.

4
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,840
What a boring man.

5
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,640
All he does when he comes home is watch TV.

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,920
However, there isn't a single...

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who is it?

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,229
It's me.

9
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,590
Just a moment.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,590
Hi.

11
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,150
Hi.

12
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,680
Hi.

13
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,090
What are you doing?

14
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,960
Waiting for you.

15
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,190
Waiting for you to discuss

16
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,090
the follow-up plan together.

17
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,530
What's that sound?

18
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,360
Phone.

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,480
The sound of the phone ringing.

20
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,650
Tomorrow morning,

21
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,680
Yao Youzhi will play golf

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,150
with the Deputy Minister of Electricity.

23
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,240
I need to know his whereabouts at all times.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,520
You two are responsible for following him.

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Then you're in charge of installing the equipment.

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,150
I'll go.

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,520
I went to Guangya Villa today

28
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,910
and reviewed its security and environment.

29
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,440
Alright.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,240
Then let's keep a close eye on him tomorrow.

31
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,390
That's settled then.

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,090
Good night.

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,410
Good night.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,030
Bye.

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,630
I feel like

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,420
she might have discovered our stuff.

37
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,440
She just didn't say it out loud.

38
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,310
Then will she...

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,150
No, she won't.

40
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,710
Zhao is one of us.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
She knows what we're doing this for.

42
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,800
Okay.

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,150
You're not ready yet?

44
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,480
Why did you get up so late?

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Someone wore me out last night.

46
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,400
Wait for me a bit.

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll wash my hair real quick.

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
Take your time getting ready.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
See you at the restaurant.

50
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,270
Okay.

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
This hotel is really nice.

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,630
They even have Chinese breakfast.

53
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,030
There's quite a variety.

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,070
We flew all this way,

55
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,590
just to eat Chinese food?

56
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,750
My "Chinese stomach"

57
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,390
has been the same for all these years and can't be changed.

58
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,680
I still remember back then,

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
about ten years ago,

60
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,140
when I first started working,

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,930
I was on a business trip.

62
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,190
I couldn't find Chinese food anywhere.

63
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,310
At that time, eating a bowl of instant noodles

64
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,370
was considered having Chinese food.

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,020
Give me one.

66
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,720
Which one?

67
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,610
The steamed bun?

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,090
How is it?

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,570
The steamed bun is the best.

70
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,870
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:54,950
Hello?

72
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,310
It's Guang.

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,240
I'll call you back later.

74
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,770
Gotta go.

75
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,760
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,750
I'm running out of time as well.

77
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,240
I'll head to the golf course first,

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,720
and you can plan your time.

79
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,630
See you later.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,450
Alright.

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,870
If you're driving,

82
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,800
take it easy on the road.

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,260
Mm-hmm.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
See you soon.

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,330
All the best.

86
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,600
Hey.

87
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,720
Why did you hang up on me earlier?

88
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,320
I wasn't available earlier.

89
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,560
It's early in the morning.

90
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,120
What could you possibly be busy with?

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
Just get to the point.

92
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,360
Alright.

93
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,950
Ms. Ma

94
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,720
checked with the taxi company

95
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,450
for the drivers who were on duty

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,680
near the overpass that day.

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
After dozens of inquiries,

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,390
there's actually some results.

99
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,720
On the night Zhao Yaning had the incident,

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,390
there was indeed a person who was heavily covered up,

101
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,870
wearing a mask and a hat,

102
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,480
getting into a car on the overpass

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,190
and then getting off at Guangzhou Road.

104
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,360
Is that the person who dealt with the white sedan?

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,630
Yes.

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,810
Then he left by taxi.

107
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,510
Is there any surveillance footage?

108
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,770
There are none nearby,

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,330
and none in the taxi either.

110
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,800
But I'm thinking,

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,480
if he got off at Guangzhou Road,

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
then it should be

113
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,800
his residence or

114
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,630
his workplace

115
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,960
somewhere in that area.

116
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
There are quite a few residential areas nearby.

117
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
We can investigate them all.

118
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,000
It'll take two or three days.

119
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,270
Let's hope he doesn't run away in these days.

120
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,390
It'll be troublesome if he switches location.

121
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,050
If he were to switch location,

122
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,490
he probably would have done so by now.

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,120
But I feel

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,270
that person is very confident

125
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,270
in his expertise,

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,930
so there's a high chance

127
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,310
he won't switch locations.

128
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,310
That makes sense.

129
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,240
Take your time investigating.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,170
There's no rush.

131
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,070
But be careful not to alert him.

132
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,600
Alright.

133
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,240
Each of you

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,480
will be responsible for a specific area.

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,120
Based on the suspect's profile,

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,510
he likely wouldn't stay

137
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
in a small single-building community.

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,830
It would be too obvious.

139
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,270
So, our main focus

140
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,650
will be on large communities that offer more concealment.

141
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,950
I feel that since moving here,

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,700
it's really comfortable.

143
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,160
And even work has become more enjoyable.

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
Just as you said,

145
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,870
when I'm stuck,

146
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,600
standing on this small balcony

147
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
feels different.

148
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,390
Right?

149
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,190
I told you

150
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
you'd like it too.

151
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,150
I'm so happy.

152
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,789
I really love

153
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,450
the feeling of being with you.

154
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,799
It's so comfortable,

155
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,000
as if

156
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,450
we've known each other for a long time,

157
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,750
and destined to be together.

158
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,580
What about you?

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,790
Destined...

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,790
Yes.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,910
It's destined.

162
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
All clear here at the golf course.

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,360
Yeah, I got the target in sight.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,660
Go ahead and begin operation.

165
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,030
Hi.

166
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,810
What are you doing?

167
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
What are you up to?

168
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,440
The wine is good.

169
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,400
You seem to be in a good mood.

170
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,960
Did you get things done?

171
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
He agreed to give us another chance.

172
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,450
Congratulations.

173
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,870
You made it through the hardest part.

174
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,240
As long as you are given a chance,

175
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,770
it's only a matter of time before you succeed.

176
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,470
I have a wild idea.

177
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,750
Does it involve me?

178
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,210
Mm-hmm.

179
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,010
Go ahead.

180
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,910
I think you'd be perfect for the PR industry.

181
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,390
Come on.

182
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,150
I'm not going to quit my job.

183
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm not asking you to quit.

184
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,750
I mean, I just think you're really suited for it.

185
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,720
Did I do something wrong

186
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,180
to give you this illusion?

187
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,480
Look, your actions yesterday

188
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,960
fully demonstrated your excellent

189
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,480
adaptability, language skills,

190
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,010
and ability to take action.

191
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
So I think if you were to do it,

192
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
you could probably do better than me,

193
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,270
just a little bit.

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,720
Your silver tongues...

195
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,910
Two completely different industries,

196
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,600
and you make them sound almost the same.

197
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,150
Actually, they are quite similar.

198
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,910
The business world is like a battlefield.

199
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,120
Not everyone likes to

200
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
play by the rules.

201
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,870
There are always those who prefer unconventional methods.

202
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,440
You get used to it after seeing it often enough.

203
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,510
For example, when I check into a hotel,

204
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,630
I always do a quick scan to see

205
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,080
if there are any bugging devices.

206
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,840
When I'm out and about,

207
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,790
I'm also wary of being followed.

208
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,510
It's to prevent anyone

209
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,860
from getting our internal information.

210
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,780
What about my room?

211
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,650
Did you check it?

212
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,700
Do you need it checked?

213
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,970
Actually, it's not necessary.

214
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,910
Rather than guarding against external dangers,

215
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,310
it's better to figure out

216
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,620
what kind of person you truly are inside.

217
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,470
Am I right?

218
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,500
So what kind of person are you?

219
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,510
Yesterday, I was your fiancé and bodyguard,

220
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,270
Tom Jerry,

221
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,840
right?

222
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,360
Yap.

223
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,960
Did you like it?

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,200
Like what?

225
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,480
The trip to Capital City.

226
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,250
I'm even busier here than in China.

227
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,920
Oh, right.

228
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,720
I did so much for you yesterday,

229
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
shouldn't the payment be settled now?

230
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,630
Are you asking me for payment?

231
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,090
Mm-hmm.

232
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,940
I dare to give, do you dare to take?

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Hello?

234
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,080
Zhao,

235
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,790
Yao has already returned to the villa.

236
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,520
Okay, I'll be right there soon.

237
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,790
I'm sorry, I need to go work for a while.

238
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,320
Alright.

239
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,910
Why don't you go out for a walk?

240
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,370
I'll watch TV in the hotel.

241
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
Drink by yourself then.

242
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,650
Okay.

243
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,870
Hope everything goes smoothly.

244
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,470
Thank you.

245
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,720
Oh, I like that.

246
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,270
Zhao.

247
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,560
The female secretary has also entered the villa.

248
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,370
Sent successfully.

249
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,510
Taylor.

250
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,360
I've already sent it to you.

251
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,590
Who is it?

252
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,070
I'm coming.

253
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,480
Excuse me.

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
Here is a package.

255
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,960
Package?

256
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,920
Who is it from?

257
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,350
Sorry, I have no idea.

258
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,500
It's a foreign guy.

259
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
A foreigner, huh?

260
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,200
Alright, thanks.

261
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
A foreigner?

262
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,480
Let me see. What's in here?

263
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,440
Who the hell did this?

264
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,070
What a bastard.

265
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,200
I want to see you all.

266
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,310
Immediately.

267
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,030
J.

268
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
We've already exited the elevator.

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,260
Yao Youzhi has already sent the address.

270
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,960
Thank you for meeting us again.

271
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,750
You really passed the line.

272
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,070
You've gone too far.

273
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,000
To be honest,

274
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
it is indeed a bit excessive.

275
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,510
But that's because

276
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,790
we're not friends. We're enemies.

277
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,160
When dealing with enemies,

278
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,890
this is our way of doing things.

279
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,880
However, when it comes to friends,

280
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
we would never act like this.

281
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,400
It's pissing me off.

282
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,550
So, what do you think?

283
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,750
Should we be friends

284
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,720
or continue being enemies?

285
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,030
We'll be leaving Capital City soon.

286
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,400
Before we go,

287
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,680
I must have an answer.

288
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,350
Fine.

289
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,960
What

290
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,880
do you really want?

291
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,070
We want to make Leader Group

292
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,110
the designated PR partner

293
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,090
for this Capital City nuclear power collaboration.

294
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,350
We

295
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,240
have already selected a PR partner.

296
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,970
Understand?

297
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,160
That can be changed.

298
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,720
What?

299
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,680
Change?

300
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Do you know what the hell you are talking about?

301
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,960
Mr. Yao,

302
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,200
please think carefully.

303
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,960
Once the contents of the USB drive are exposed,

304
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,440
it will be a sexual scandal of catastrophic proportions.

305
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,270
How will your hot-tempered wife

306
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,070
face this?

307
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,070
How will your father-in-law, the chairman of the chamber of commerce,

308
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,920
accept this?

309
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Think it over.

310
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,480
We can foresee that

311
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,590
Taiyu Group's stock price

312
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
will inevitably plummet.

313
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,720
Your reputation will be ruined,

314
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,000
and you may even find it impossible

315
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,800
to continue your business career in Capital City.

316
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,440
Weigh the consequences carefully.

317
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,070
Mr. Yao,

318
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,400
you've been in business for many years.

319
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
You must be able to calculate this clearly.

320
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,200
So, will you make the change?

321
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,790
Okay.

322
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,960
You.

323
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,680
I promise you.

324
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,350
You will definitely get

325
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,920
what you want.

326
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,680
You get it?

327
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,920
Thank you so much.

328
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,110
Let's celebrate our success.

329
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,570
We're off to a great start.

330
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,880
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations.

331
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,190
You've managed to handle

332
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,730
such a difficult task. I'm really impressed!

333
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,480
Thank you.

334
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,270
I'm really not good at dancing.

335
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,000
You are pretty good at dancing.

336
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,060
Would you like some more to drink?

337
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,830
No.

338
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Don't you know that in Capital City,

339
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,900
you can't pour your own drink?

340
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,790
Why is that?

341
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,270
People who pour their own drinks

342
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,480
are lonely.

343
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,310
Okay.

344
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,140
Then I'll pour for you.

345
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,790
You're not lonely either.

346
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,790
Thank you.

347
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,480
So,

348
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,000
did you resolve this matter

349
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
at the golf course today?

350
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,200
What do you mean?

351
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,510
I lied to you.

352
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
What did you say? I didn't catch that.

353
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,830
I lied to you.

354
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,880
I didn't catch that.

355
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,610
I lied to you.

356
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,590
You are lying and still so confident about it?

357
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,050
How did you lie to me again?

358
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
To make him compromise,

359
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,310
I used a little trick.

360
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,640
That day,

361
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,070
when you went to the Guangya Villa with me,

362
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,160
I was not only

363
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,310
to confirm the location of his house,

364
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,000
but also to investigate his family members,

365
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,070
properties,

366
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,480
and other materials.

367
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,590
Now that we've collected

368
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,510
all the materials,

369
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,960
we confronted him.

370
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,440
So that day,

371
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,270
when you and I posed as reporters

372
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,480
to get his schedule from his company,

373
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,640
it was also to determine

374
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,790
when he would be at home

375
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,400
and when he wouldn't, right?

376
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,540
You don't need to tell me all this.

377
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,550
I don't need to know that you lied to me.

378
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,720
I don't want to lie to you.

379
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,070
I consider you a friend.

380
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,960
My friend.

381
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,920
After lying to me, you then say you don't want to lie to me.

382
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,180
You really are a good friend, aren't you?

383
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,160
So how did you resolve it?

384
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,640
You didn't use any extreme measures, did you?

385
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,270
There are professionals who do this.

386
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,510
We just spent some money.

387
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,510
Money makes the world go round, huh?

388
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,330
Is that a look of contempt towards me?

389
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,350
No.

390
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,750
It's just that I used to think

391
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,010
PR companies were something different.

392
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,680
I didn't expect PR companies

393
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,000
to handle so many things.

394
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,160
It's just not

395
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,550
what I imagined.

396
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,920
I have no choice.

397
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,440
It's a direct order from the boss.

398
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,680
We must secure

399
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,550
the contract with Taiyu Group.

400
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,830
I'm just an employee.

401
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,030
What can I do?

402
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,750
But haven't you already

403
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,400
secured

404
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,160
the contract with Huaze Group?

405
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,240
This Yao Youzhi

406
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,590
is already trying to persuade Huaze Group

407
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,350
to change their PR partner.

408
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
If I can't win him over,

409
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll lose

410
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,350
the Huaze Group contract

411
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,110
as well.

412
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,680
What else could I do?

413
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,070
How could I explain this to my boss?

414
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,680
I really have no choice.

415
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,240
Come on, my friend.

416
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,960
Come on, liar.

417
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Why are you just sitting here

418
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,440
and not drinking?

419
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,400
Come on,

420
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,550
let's drink.

421
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,240
Come on,

422
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,750
drink up.

423
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Mr. Taylor,

424
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,070
Cheers! It's my first time drinking.

425
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,790
Congratulations on landing this project.

426
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,510
A single drink is no fun.

427
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,200
Let's go for three bottles

428
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,750
and a bomb shot.

429
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,000
Come on, come on, come on!

430
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,640
Let's go!

431
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,170
I'm feeling dizzy.

432
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,350
I'm feeling dizzy.

433
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,270
Mr. Yao.

434
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,680
It's been a pleasure working with you.

435
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,490
From now on, we're friends.

436
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,720
Hello?

437
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,550
Zhao,

438
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,830
well done.

439
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,510
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

440
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,920
It's the result of everyone's effort.

441
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,830
I heard

442
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,490
Yang Guang also helped.

443
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,660
He passively helped a little.

444
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,720
So he knows about this matter as well?

445
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,100
I revealed a little to him.

446
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,390
Just a little.

447
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,250
This is a rare opportunity.

448
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,920
Try a little harder

449
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,210
to win him over.

450
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,920
I believe you can do it.

451
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,570
Congratulations.

452
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,720
Although the process was tortuous,

453
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,650
fortunately, the outcome is good.

454
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,280
Where are those two troublemakes?

455
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,920
They've already rolled back to Yanping with the contract.

456
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,720
I'm free now.

457
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
You're not going back with them?

458
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,920
I brought you here for a vacation,

459
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,690
but instead,

460
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,510
I've been making you accompany me on business every day.

461
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,720
I should at least take you around for a bit.

462
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,160
It's also a way

463
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,900
to make the most of our limited vacation.

464
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,770
Tell me about yourself.

465
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,160
I...

466
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,680
Besides your work,

467
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,120
I know nothing about you.

468
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
My name is Yang Guang.

469
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,240
I was born in Yanping,

470
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,500
and grew up in Yanping.

471
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,110
Both my parents work in the public sector,

472
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,960
the classic mix of a strict father and a nurturing mother.

473
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,110
What's your zodiac sign?

474
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,570
Gemini.

475
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,240
Blood type?

476
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,680
AB.

477
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,750
You must fight with yourself a lot, huh?

478
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
What's your favorite color?

479
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,480
Black.

480
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,110
What's your favorite season?

481
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,590
Autumn.

482
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,510
I own a car.

483
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,160
My parents

484
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,310
have an 80-square-meter apartment in the city.

485
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,770
The two of them live there.

486
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,060
I'm currently renting an apartment,

487
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,030
living alone.

488
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,030
I'm in good health,

489
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,810
with an outgoing

490
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,840
and positive personality.

491
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,490
I hope to find a beautiful,

492
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,160
kind,

493
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,550
and generous lady

494
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,860
to spend...

495
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,220
Are you on a blind date?

496
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,050
That's nice.

497
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,150
Nothing can stop us, rain or shine.

498
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,150
How romantic.

499
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,159
I don't even know when your birthday is.

500
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,800
I don't celebrate my birthday.

501
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,440
Why not?

502
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,760
Afraid of getting older?

503
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,090
Every time on my birthday,

504
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,670
there's no one by my side.

505
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,159
Who wants to celebrate birthday alone?

506
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,670
I'm going to the bathroom.

507
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,000
Okay.

508
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,690
Happy birthday.

509
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,230
I don't know if it's an early

510
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,320
or belated birthday celebration,

511
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
but there's no better day than today.

512
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
So, let's do it today.

513
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,300
Come on.

514
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,170
Look.

515
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,770
Come.

516
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,510
Happy birthday to you.

517
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,880
Happy birthday to you.

518
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,230
Okay.

519
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,150
Happy birthday to you.

520
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,000
Happy birthday to you.

521
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,110
Happy birthday to you.

522
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,000
Happy birthday to you.

523
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,840
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

524
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,150
Happy birthday to you.

525
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,670
Thank you.

526
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,280
Thank you for the birthday cake.

527
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,480
I hope all your wishes come true.

528
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,150
Good night,

529
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,680
Alethea.

530
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,690
Good night.

531
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Sonny.

532
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,070
Ah.

533
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,870
Are you tired?

534
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,690
Not too bad.

535
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,460
Do you want to have a drink?

536
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,160
Let me pack up first.

537
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,600
Hi.

538
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,000
Hi.

539
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,630
Please come in.

540
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,030
Okay.

541
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,440
How are you?

542
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,630
Are you all packed?

543
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,710
I figured, since I can't sleep anyway,

544
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,510
a glass of wine

545
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,120
might help me sleep better.

546
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,060
Just this one, though.

547
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,590
It's all gone.

548
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,450
That's enough.

549
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,820
Cheers.

550
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,590
Room service.

551
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,990
Did you order?

552
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,880
I didn't.

553
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Let me take a look.

554
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,480
Hi.

555
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,230
Sir,

556
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,670
this is part of our anniversary package

557
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,880
given to our guests.

558
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,800
Anniversary?

559
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,320
Yes.

560
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,290
Okay.

561
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,010
Please.

562
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,190
Go!

563
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,290
Take the stairs.

564
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,210
We're here.

565
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,000
You...

566
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,420
Why aren't you answering your phone?

567
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,320
How's it going, Ms. Ma?

568
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,280
We've already gone through most of the surveillance footage,

569
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,410
and we should have some findings soon.

570
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,160
Good work, everyone.

571
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,190
Let's try to get this done

572
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,360
before Division Director Yang returns.

573
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,920
As soon as he's back,

574
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,150
we'll give him a surprise.

575
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay.
