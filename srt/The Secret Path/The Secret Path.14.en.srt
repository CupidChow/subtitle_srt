1
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,120
Let's not be so formal with each other from now on.

2
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,920
I said we're friends, after all.

3
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,870
I've noticed recently that

4
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,530
you've been recovering well,

5
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,039
and I feel that

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,770
you're not as aloof towards me as before.

7
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,640
You've become more approachable,

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
much more relaxed and at ease.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
That's great.

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,350
That's because I truly

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,810
consider you a friend now.

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,200
In front of friends,

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,620
who wants to look so aloof, right?

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Then allow me ask you to keep it that way, okay?

15
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,760
Okay.

16
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Thank you.

17
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,750
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,810
I have to leave now.

19
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,240
Today, the company's legal team

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,430
is going to Huaze to review the contract.

21
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,079
I need to go back and keep an eye on them.

22
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,960
Alright, no problem.

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,430
You may leave.

24
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,760
Okay.

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
Would you like the roast duck to be packed?

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,020
How about you take it home?

27
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,710
Okay.

28
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,240
I've already paid the bill.

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,800
You're not giving me any chance, are you?

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,329
I said I wanted to thank you.

31
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,570
Then next time.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,290
Okay.

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,000
Bye-bye.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,530
Bye-bye.

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,710
Excuse me, please pack it up.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,150
Sure.

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Can you come back?

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,590
You left a brown paper bag

39
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,560
in the restaurant.

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,490
That's not mine.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,560
It's yours.

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Mine?

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,130
Open it and take a look.

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
What do you mean by this?

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
This is your first PR income.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,220
It's what you deserve.

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
You should come back.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,710
Okay?

49
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,360
Alright, see you later.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,610
Why are you here?

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,430
I was afraid daytime might be inconvenient for you.

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,960
So I waited here for you to come back.

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
To return this to you.

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
What are you doing?

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,650
Didn't I make myself clear?

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,240
This is what you deserve.

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,050
I adhere to discipline.

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,190
Alright, I know.

59
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,160
I know your identity.

60
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
And I know you're an upright person.

61
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,270
In our PR industry, the most valuable thing

62
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,200
is interpersonal relationships.

63
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,270
For me, this is just industry practice.

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,160
For you,

65
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,190
it's just a deserved compensation.

66
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,040
That's all.

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,120
Don't.

68
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,680
I can accept the meal.

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,190
But I definitely can't take the money.

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,950
What's the matter?

71
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,810
Nowadays, there're still people who refuse money?

72
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,770
Money is a good thing, everyone wants it.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,460
But what I shouldn't take,

74
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,450
I can't take.

75
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,140
Didn't you say we're friends?

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,390
If we're friends,

77
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,550
don't put your friend in a difficult position.

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,450
I'm leaving.

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,780
Yang Guang.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,630
Bye-bye, Alethea.

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,640
Hello?

82
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,720
Hello, Comrade Yang Guang.

83
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm from the Disciplinary Inspection Group of Yanping State Security Bureau.

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,090
I'm Zhao Peizhi.

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
Hello.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,720
There's something I need to verify with you in person.

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,120
Please come to our office

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
at 2 p.m. today.

89
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,040
Alright.

90
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,470
See you this afternoon then.

91
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,909
See you in the afternoon.

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,940
Come in.

93
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,090
Yang Guang.

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,750
Division Director Yang,

95
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,310
have a seat.

96
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,640
Okay.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,270
Let's get straight to the point.

98
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,310
I'm from the Yanping State Security Bureau.

99
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm Liu Xiangjun, the head of the Disciplinary Inspection Group.

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,040
This is our disciplinary inspector, Zhao Peizhi.

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,630
Hello to both of you.

102
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,920
We asked you to come here today

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
because there are some matters

104
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,390
we'd like to verify with you in person.

105
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,890
What's this about?

106
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,250
It's like this.

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,950
You just need to

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,510
answer my questions

109
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,310
one by one,

110
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,720
truthfully and honestly.

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,409
No problem.

112
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,480
Let's begin.

113
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,830
Okay.

114
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,680
On June 14th at noon,

115
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,170
where were you?

116
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,120
That noon,

117
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,240
I was having lunch with a friend.

118
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,840
With whom?

119
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,390
The vice president of Leader PR Company,

120
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,320
Ms. Zhao Yaning.

121
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,040
What did she give you?

122
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,560
Cash.

123
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,920
How much?

124
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,310
Roughly $20,000 by my estimate.

125
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,470
What was it contained in?

126
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,510
Just a regular brown paper bag.

127
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,600
Is this it?

128
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,720
Yes.

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,750
The person in this photo,

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,540
that's you, right?

131
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,230
That's me.

132
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,570
Here's the situation.

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,270
Someone has reported that

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,120
you accepted a bribe.

135
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,070
The Ms. Zhao you just mentioned...

136
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,800
Zhao Yaning.

137
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
You said it without hesitation.

138
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,920
It seems you're quite familiar.

139
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,210
Why did she give you money?

140
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,070
She said the money

141
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,510
was a thank-you fee from the PR company.

142
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,240
So what did you do for her

143
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,750
or on her behalf?

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Leader PR Company

145
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,780
wanted to establish cooperation with Huaze Group.

146
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,490
Zhao Yaning wanted me to testify that

147
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,040
Leader PR Company

148
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,680
has no direct connection

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,270
to Moss Trading Group's case.

150
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,430
So one noon,

151
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,050
without informing me in advance,

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
she arranged a lunch with me, Mr. Xiang

153
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,010
from Huaze Group and Mr. Ou.

154
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,150
At the table,

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,809
I simply recounted

156
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,350
the publicly known details of the case.

157
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,490
I didn't say a word more than that.

158
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,630
Afterwards, she said she wanted to thank me.

159
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,670
That's why the $20,000 incident happened.

160
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,670
Zhao Yaning said,

161
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,720
this is the unwritten rule in the PR industry.

162
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,360
She insisted that I must accept it.

163
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,720
So you admit you took the $20,000?

164
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,440
No.

165
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
I returned the money to her that very day.

166
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,100
Where's the evidence?

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Can I use my phone?

168
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,910
Alright, I understand.

169
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,750
I know your identity.

170
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,900
I also know you're an upright person.

171
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,840
In our PR industry,

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,080
the most valuable thing is interpersonal relationships.

173
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,960
For me, this is just industry practice.

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,840
For you,

175
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,900
it's a well-deserved compensation.

176
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Is that all?

177
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,380
I can accept a meal,

178
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,000
but I definitely can't take money.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,720
What's the matter?

180
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,960
Keep this recording.

181
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,550
Also, for the entire process of me

182
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,630
returning the money to

183
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,600
Zhao Yaning,

184
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,840
the dashcam in my car

185
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,050
has recorded everything on video.

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,970
I can provide it to you anytime.

187
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,200
Okay.

188
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,200
So,

189
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,510
besides this $20,000 in cash,

190
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,150
have you received any other payments?

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,750
No.

192
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,000
Really nothing?

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Really, nothing.

194
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,880
How do you explain this?

195
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,430
I have no idea what this is about.

196
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,630
Take a look first.

197
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,790
This bank account number at the top,

198
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,870
it's yours, right?

199
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,000
It is mine,

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
but I haven't used this bank card

201
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
for a very long time.

202
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,470
This is the money Leader Group

203
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,690
transferred from overseas to your bank account,

204
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
a total of $20,000,

205
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,140
approximately 150,000 yuan.

206
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,510
I don't know what they're trying to do.

207
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,120
So you're saying that you had no idea

208
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,080
of Leader Group transferring money to you,

209
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,550
is that right?

210
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,130
Of course I had no idea of it.

211
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,920
Zhao Yaning brought me cash,

212
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,360
and I returned it to her that very day.

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,420
I even kept audio and video evidence.

214
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,290
I've been very careful.

215
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,120
But for online transfers,

216
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,390
as long as they have my bank account,

217
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,670
they only need a computer

218
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,480
and within one minute,

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,630
without my consent,

220
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,030
they could complete the process.

221
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,560
I can't guard against that.

222
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,520
Besides, such a basic mistake,

223
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
I've been working for the Chinese Ministry of State Security

224
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
for so many years.

225
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,870
$20,000,

226
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,550
do you think I would make

227
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,790
such a foolish mistake?

228
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,600
Don't get excited.

229
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,240
Calm down.

230
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,220
It's like this.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
From a personal standpoint,

232
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,240
I believe you.

233
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,870
But there must be

234
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,360
a reason for everything.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,840
Our disciplinary inspection department has strict rules.

236
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,440
No matter who makes a mistake

237
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,030
or engages in misconduct,

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
we need to conduct a thorough investigation.

239
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,860
As the old saying goes,

240
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,480
we won't wrongly accuse an innocent person,

241
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,150
but we won't

242
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,760
let a guilty one go free either.

243
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,360
Understood.

244
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,010
Breaking news.

245
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,020
I just received the information 15 minutes ago.

246
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,270
Capital City has changed its operator?

247
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,960
Due to the Sun Daren incident,

248
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
the Capital City Electric Power Corporation

249
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
has been exposed for collective corruption.

250
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,870
The Capital City Electric Power has

251
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,870
handed over the actual operation of

252
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,360
the nuclear power project to Taiyu Group.

253
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,870
Taiyu Group, whose CEO is Yao Youzhi?

254
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,140
I immediately notified Huaze Group,

255
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,790
but Xiang Taisheng told me that

256
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,630
Taiyu Group had already

257
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,030
contacted them directly.

258
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,030
Yao Youzhi's attitude is very firm.

259
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,720
He absolutely refuses to have us as the PR agency.

260
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,600
Damn it.

261
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,190
Why did they choose them?

262
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,200
That project back then,

263
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,170
we caused Yao Youzhi to lose 300 million.

264
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,600
He won't work with us again.

265
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,420
I know about that project.

266
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,550
Our big boss was very happy,

267
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,480
but I heard

268
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,720
Yao Youzhi even wanted to kill you.

269
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,850
You know him better.

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,960
Do you think there's still a possibility for PR?

271
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
He's as stubborn as a mule.

272
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,170
Based on what I know about him,

273
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,120
he's likely to threaten Huaze

274
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,970
to terminate our PR agreement.

275
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
At this point, Huaze Group

276
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,630
probably doesn't want to change PR agencies.

277
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,200
We've already initiated the contract process.

278
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,080
Stopping now

279
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,030
would cost them too much time.

280
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,490
We must think of a solution.

281
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,250
Alright.

282
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,600
I'll go contact

283
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,720
our connections in Capital City

284
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,520
to inquire about the situation.

285
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,240
Hello?

286
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,310
Where are you?

287
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,790
I'm at the company.

288
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,450
Wait for me.

289
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,780
I'll be there soon.

290
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,720
I...

291
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,790
Hello, the number you have dialled

292
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,790
is currently busy.

293
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,480
Please try again later.

294
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,240
Hello, who are you looking for?

295
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,970
Is Zhao Yaning here?

296
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,840
Do you have an appointment?

297
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,200
No, is she in?

298
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,200
Okay, please wait a moment.

299
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
Ms. Zhao, a man at the front desk is looking for you.

300
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,920
Alright.

301
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,280
Please wait.

302
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,560
Thank you.

303
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
What's so urgent?

304
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,700
Do we need to talk here?

305
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Follow me.

306
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,320
I told you.

307
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,790
I can't accept the money.

308
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
This is a serious disciplinary violation.

309
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,480
Why did you still transfer money to my card?

310
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,950
How did you get my account information?

311
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,130
When you went to the front desk to pay that day,

312
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,080
your wallet was on the table.

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,440
There were several cards inside.

314
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,370
I just noted down the card numbers.

315
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,450
Why did you do this?

316
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,200
In the PR industry,

317
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,480
there's no such thing as helping for free.

318
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,550
This is just my way of

319
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,210
expressing gratitude to you.

320
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,880
You didn't accept cash,

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,670
so I finally transferred it to your card.

322
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,750
Why didn't you tell me?

323
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,010
If I had told you, you'd have returned it.

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
I really didn't want to go through all that trouble.

325
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
You didn't want trouble?

326
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm now being investigated by the disciplinary inspection department.

327
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,150
Is it because of me?

328
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,350
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
I really didn't know that

330
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,810
I'd cause you such big trouble.

331
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,720
Who took the photo?

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,910
What photo?

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,730
The one of me looking at the cash

334
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,960
at the restaurant entrance.

335
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,550
It appeared today on the desk of

336
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,950
our disciplinary inspection department.

337
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,610
I was reported by someone.

338
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,990
Did you have someone take it?

339
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,400
How could I have someone take it?

340
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,240
Why would you think that?

341
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,870
In this matter,

342
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,360
you've been a great help to me.

343
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,390
I haven't even had the chance to thank you.

344
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,920
Why would I want to harm you?

345
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,370
You still don't believe me, do you?

346
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,109
So this is who you think I am.

347
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,310
Fine.

348
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,000
Return the money now.

349
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,920
I'll write an explanation letter to your leaders.

350
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,270
I'll clarify the whole situation.

351
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,460
I'll clear your name in the end, okay?

352
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,460
Don't stare at me like I'm a criminal.

353
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,609
I'm not your prisoner.

354
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,770
I'm dealing with a very tricky situation.

355
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,730
I have to go to Capital City tomorrow morning.

356
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,680
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

357
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,260
But there's one thing I must tell you.

358
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,640
To you,

359
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,100
I have a clear conscience.

360
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,680
Your boy is angry?

361
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,000
You arranged for someone to secretly photograph him,

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
and then sent the photos

363
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,540
to his superiors, didn't you?

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,510
Why did you do this?

365
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,350
Don't worry, I'm helping you.

366
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,680
You're helping me?

367
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,510
You arranged for someone to secretly photograph him.

368
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,000
Couldn't you at least have told me?

369
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,830
You've put me in a very passive position now.

370
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,750
Don't be angry.

371
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,910
If I had told you earlier,

372
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,240
your reaction wouldn't be so genuine.

373
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,590
I want to create a rift

374
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,310
between Yang Guang

375
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,440
and Yanping State Security Bureau.

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,920
This is my first step in driving a wedge between them.

377
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
Your first step in driving a wedge between them

378
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,830
has already destroyed

379
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,160
the good impression I just built with him.

380
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,830
You're too exaggerating.

381
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,770
After all, you didn't take the photos.

382
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,350
He won't be angry once he calms down.

383
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,250
Besides, your relationship is very good now.

384
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,520
The fact that you gave him money,

385
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,030
whether it violated his principles or not,

386
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,960
shows your good intentions.

387
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,240
So,

388
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,340
no matter how he feels now,

389
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,010
he'll definitely forgive you in the end.

390
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,350
And the Yanping State Security Bureau will become

391
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,200
an impersonal organization in his mind.

392
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,590
At that time,

393
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,030
you can start the second step:

394
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,560
gradually softening him up.

395
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,310
There could even be a third step in the future:

396
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,930
turning him.

397
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,360
Don't be angry anymore.

398
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,160
What's bothering us now isn't this matter,

399
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,240
but the situation in the Capital City.

400
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,640
Secret photography?

401
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,830
No, this is too shameless.

402
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
How could she push you into such a dangerous situation?

403
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
What on earth is she thinking?

404
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,340
Calm down, don't speak so loudly.

405
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,030
This matter shouldn't have anything to do with her.

406
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,430
How do you know it has nothing to do with her?

407
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,550
I just went to her company to find her.

408
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,210
I confronted her face to face.

409
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,390
From her reaction, I believe

410
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
that she probably didn't know about it.

411
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,080
No, but...

412
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,530
How would she tell you?

413
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,590
Moreover,

414
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,680
who else knew about that lunch besides her?

415
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,160
Zhao Yaning transferred such a large sum of money

416
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,680
to my account through Leader Company's account.

417
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,510
Her boss James must have known about it.

418
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,920
If this matter has nothing to do with Zhao Yaning,

419
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,720
then James can't be uninvolved.

420
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,070
Secret photography plus reporting,

421
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,130
there must be something behind this.

422
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,510
Alright.

423
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,270
You always have something to say.

424
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,720
Bro,

425
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,290
can you do me a favor?

426
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,720
Help me find out who secretly photographed me

427
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,450
and what they really want to do.

428
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,270
Got it.

429
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,880
I have to go to Capital City early morning tomorrow.

430
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,010
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

431
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,810
But there's one thing I must tell you.

432
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,200
To you,

433
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,050
I have a clear conscience.

434
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,350
Hey.

435
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,790
Let me give you a ride.

436
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,270
What's so urgent that you have to rush to

437
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,370
Capital City so early in the morning?

438
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,880
The corruption scandal involving the senior management of

439
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,160
Capital City Electric Power Corporation has started to escalate.

440
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,890
Sun Daren has been taken away for investigation.

441
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,430
You should know all this.

442
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,550
Now the Capital City Electric Power Corporation

443
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,720
has handed over the nuclear power cooperation to Taiyu Group.

444
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,550
But Leader had some issues

445
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,480
with Yao Youzhi, the CEO of Taiyu Group,

446
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
in the past.

447
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,040
So I need to go and handle it.

448
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,830
How are you going to handle it when you get there?

449
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,090
Negotiate, of course.

450
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,840
That's good.

451
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,530
That's what you're good at.

452
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,330
Are you going alone?

453
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,920
No.

454
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,720
I have two colleagues.

455
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,110
They're busy with other case.

456
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,000
They'll depart from Turkey after they're done.

457
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,680
We'll meet up in Capital City.

458
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,960
I see.

459
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,250
You're interrogating me again, aren't you?

460
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,550
No.

461
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,930
I'm just making conversation.

462
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,490
Yesterday,

463
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,710
I did speak a bit harshly.

464
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,910
And I was a bit impulsive.

465
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,280
I'd like to formally apologize to you here.

466
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,110
I accept your apology.

467
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,680
Actually,

468
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,880
I just hope you don't misunderstand

469
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,280
my original intentions.

470
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,440
I won't misunderstand.

471
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,850
So how're you going to handle the situation at your work?

472
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,440
Do you need me to go to your workplace

473
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,680
and clarify things for you?

474
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
If you need me to do so,

475
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,750
I can go as soon as I return from Capital City.

476
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,210
No need.

477
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,940
I trust the organization.

478
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,310
They won't wrongly accuse a good person,

479
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,640
nor will they let a bad person off the hook.

480
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,830
In any case,

481
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,310
this matter is somewhat related to me.

482
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,550
I'd also like to formally apologize to you.

483
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,950
So we're even now, right?

484
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,750
Can you forget about this?

485
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,410
Yes, we can.

486
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,290
Have a safe journey later.

487
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,750
Thank you.

488
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,300
When you come back,

489
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,080
I'll treat you to a meal.

490
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,910
The disciplinary inspection team contacted you?

491
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,900
They contacted me yesterday.

492
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,380
They contacted me as well.

493
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,830
They asked me about your situation.

494
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,860
There must be more to this matter.

495
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,340
Tell me,

496
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,760
who took these photos secretly?

497
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,650
It must be someone from Leader Group.

498
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,720
I think

499
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,100
this is their combination punch.

500
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,170
First, they offered you a PR fee

501
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,350
to show goodwill.

502
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,480
Then,

503
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
they hit you with a whip from below,

504
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,250
to stir up trouble between you and the bureau,

505
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,050
making you lean towards Leader Group psychologically.

506
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,680
If I'm not mistaken,

507
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,400
this is the beginning of their attempt to turn you.

508
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,030
As a State Security officer,

509
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,590
who'd want to turn you?

510
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,520
Leader Group,

511
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,880
what kind of company is it?

512
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,290
It's terrifying when you think about it.

513
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,790
Recently, the Capital City Power is going to hold

514
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,000
an energy negotiation meeting in Capital City.

515
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,240
Leader Group

516
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,060
is desperate to participate.

517
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,790
However,

518
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,030
they didn't get the qualification to attend.

519
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,490
But they haven't given up.

520
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,960
They're still actively trying.

521
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,790
This morning, I drove Zhao Yaning to the airport.

522
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,300
On the way, she revealed to me that

523
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,840
due to mass corruption in Capital City Power,

524
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,520
the Capital City leadership

525
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,240
has transferred the nuclear power cooperation project

526
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
to Taiyu Group.

527
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,940
The reason she rushed to Capital City

528
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,880
is to secure the contract with Taiyu Group.

529
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,660
They've secured the contract with Huaze Group,

530
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,360
and now they want Taiyu Group's as well?

531
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,110
They're just determined to get into

532
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,440
this nuclear power cooperation project.

533
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,720
This can't help but make me very suspicious of

534
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,850
their real motives.

535
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,030
On my way here,

536
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,110
I carefully reviewed

537
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,790
the recent events.

538
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,940
From Liu Lijing approaching Yang Youliang,

539
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,910
to the Jiangcheng incident,

540
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,030
to Mr. Sun's death,

541
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,350
we've already investigated all of these.

542
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,210
It was done by Moss Trading Group.

543
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,340
Their real purpose is to steal

544
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,200
China's 4th-generation nuclear power technology.

545
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,030
Leader Group,

546
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,110
as the PR firm for Moss Trading Group,

547
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,360
is intricately involved

548
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,200
and has appeared ambiguously

549
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,750
in almost every case.

550
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,110
First, in the Jiangcheng incident,

551
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,070
Zhao Yaning was at the scene.

552
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,240
She also appeared at Chairman Xie's hospital.

553
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,700
When Mr. Sun was murdered,

554
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,270
she happened to be at the National Convention Center.

555
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,160
In the negotiations between Moss Trading Group and Capital City Power,

556
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,820
she was involved throughout.

557
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,810
On the day Sander Bowie was arrested,

558
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,080
she mysteriously appeared in Lianhai.

559
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,070
Later, when Xiang Taisheng took over Huaze Group,

560
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,200
he initially refused to cooperate with Leader Group.

561
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,070
To secure Huaze Group,

562
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Leader Group had Zhao Yaning contact me,

563
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,690
someone with such a special status, for help.

564
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Afterwards, under the guise of a PR fee,

565
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,620
they openly tried to bribe me.

566
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,770
After I returned the money,

567
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,660
my department received a report letter.

568
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
All of these above,

569
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,550
do you think this is

570
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,750
the behavior of a normal PR company?

571
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,440
Obviously not.

572
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,900
Following your logic,

573
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,110
can we make a

574
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,030
a bold guess?

575
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,550
Let's suppose Leader PR Company

576
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,510
is not just a normal PR company,

577
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,690
but rather a spy organization.

578
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,830
Wouldn't that make

579
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,480
everything above reasonable?

580
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,960
So the reason I called you here

581
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,850
is that I want to send you to Capital City.

582
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,400
This time, for the Capital City

583
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,260
Energy Negotiation Conference,

584
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,350
some important Chinese leader will be attending.

585
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,330
I want to send you

586
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,450
as the head of the security team

587
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,270
to attend the conference

588
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,920
and be responsible for the Chinese side's security.

589
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,880
At that time,

590
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,050
the people from Leader

591
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,810
will definitely notice your presence

592
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,790
and will try every means to contact you.

593
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,960
This is an excellent opportunity

594
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,200
for substantial close contact

595
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,880
with them.

596
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,130
Understood.

597
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,160
But remember,

598
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,680
no matter when,

599
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,650
never actively approach the target.

600
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,200
It's easy to expose yourself that way.

601
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,080
The waves might be high,

602
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,540
but you need to patiently wait for

603
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,160
the fish to take the bait.

604
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes.

605
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,680
Ms. Zhao,

606
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,930
long time no see.

607
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,960
Long time no see.

608
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,940
Ms. Zhao, you're still as beautiful as ever.

609
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,400
How's the contact with Taiyu Group going?

610
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,060
Has Yao Youzhi agreed to meet?

611
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,270
They said recently he needs to attend

612
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,240
an energy conference in Capital City

613
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,880
and doesn't want to be disturbed during the time.

614
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,140
He'll reschedule after the conference.

615
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,350
Could Yao Youzhi be using the Capital City

616
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,880
Energy Conference as an excuse to put us off?

617
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,690
Who did you schedule with before?

618
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
Yao Youzhi's secretary.

619
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,510
They told you to reschedule after the conference,

620
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,000
but they didn't promise you can get an appointment?

621
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,800
That's right.

622
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,530
She is his secretary

623
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,750
who can only do this much.

624
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,210
She can't make the final decision on her own.

625
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,400
This is too risky.

626
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,480
We can't afford to wait like this.

627
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,720
We still need to find a way to try to

628
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
schedule directly with Yao Youzhi himself.

629
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,960
We can't even see him.

630
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
How can you schedule directly with him?

631
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,510
I've got some news here.

632
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,920
The day after tomorrow, Capital City Electric Power

633
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,640
will host a welcome dinner for the Capital City Energy Conference

634
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,200
at the Guangfu Palace Hotel.

635
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Yao Youzhi will also attend.

636
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,110
Can we use this opportunity

637
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,350
to approach him

638
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,010
and try to schedule a meeting?

639
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,500
We can give it a try.

640
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,590
Mentor, it looks like

641
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,400
the location should be there.

642
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,880
Tan, go contact the property management

643
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,110
and get copies of the surveillance footage

644
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,310
from all the surrounding streets

645
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,400
when Division Director Yang

646
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,060
was having the lunch that day.

647
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,750
Remember, all the surrounding streets' footage.

648
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,480
Understood.

649
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,790
Here, have some.

650
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,550
I'm not eating.

651
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,830
I must finish this part's translation today.

652
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,480
You go ahead with your work, Dear.

653
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Alright, I'll let you focus then.

654
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:23,970
Mm-hmm.

655
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
I won't disturb you anymore.

656
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,350
Can you talk now?

657
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,560
Hello?

658
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,600
Hello?

659
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,750
Sir,

660
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,480
how can I help you?

661
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,130
They went to the place where I took photos of Yang Guang.

662
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,910
They're already onto me.

663
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,350
I can't continue the operation for now.

664
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,720
It's too dangerous.

665
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay.

666
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,880
Safety first.

667
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,160
Let's not communicate by phone for now.

668
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,920
Is there a safer way to contact?

669
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,830
Guangcai Game App.

670
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,920
My IP of the account is

671
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,240
491267.

672
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,750
Send encrypted messages in the game.

673
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,680
Okay, got it.

674
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,400
Look.

675
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
It's this person.

676
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,790
Next camera.

677
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,160
Next camera.

678
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,880
Why are there so many deliverymen?

679
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,550
That's a rider station inside.

680
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,280
I've investigated this entrance.

681
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,540
It's a dead end inside.

682
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,600
So this opening is the only exit.

683
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
The suspect must come out from here.

684
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,110
That's not right.

685
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,190
Why hasn't that man come out?

686
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,170
Pause here.

687
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,400
Ziwei,

688
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,280
go back to

689
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,800
the point where he entered this alley.

690
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,840
Stop.

691
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,880
Zoom in.

692
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,070
His feet.

693
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Take a screenshot.

694
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Continue watching from this point.

695
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,280
Stop.

696
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,710
This person.

697
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,370
Zoom in on this person's feet.

698
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,800
See? It's the same person.

699
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,030
To avoid the surveillance cameras,

700
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,280
he changed his clothes.

701
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,360
Quite cunning.

702
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,070
Continue playing forward.

703
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,400
Let's see where he goes.

704
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,480
Where is he?

705
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,850
Are there any more cameras?

706
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,050
This is the last one.

707
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,550
Then let's use this intersection

708
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,680
as the center point.

709
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,110
Check all the surveillance cameras in the surrounding area.

710
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,230
We must find him.

711
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay.

712
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,360
Also,

713
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,230
don't you think this person's

714
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,000
physical characteristics

715
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,960
are very similar to the one who damaged

716
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,670
Zhao Yaning's brake fluid line?

717
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,700
The entire hotel has been booked.

718
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,670
There are many security guards,

719
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
just everywhere.

720
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,240
Even a fly'd need to go through security to get in.

721
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,000
Yao Youzhi has come out.

722
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
What method should we use

723
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,320
to make contact with him?

724
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,600
I'm so glad to see you.

725
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,290
Welcome.

726
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,630
I think he's here to lead.

727
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,660
China's side got to Capital City.

728
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,840
That Yao Youzhi,

729
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,480
look at him sucking up.

730
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,170
It's disgusting to watch.

731
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,320
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

732
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,360
What are your instructions?

733
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,590
Where are you?

734
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,400
I'm in Capital City.

735
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,730
You're in Capital City?

736
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,480
You're amazing.

737
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,610
You knew I was here but didn't even tell me.

738
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,280
This is official business,

739
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,340
you'd understand.

740
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
How are you doing?

741
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,930
Is that international negotiation going smoothly?

742
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,260
Don't even mention it.

743
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,340
I haven't even met him yet.

744
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,760
Who is it? Who's so bold?

745
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,840
How dare they neglect Ms. Zhao?

746
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,100
Who else could they be?

747
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,260
The one I mentioned to you before.

748
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Yao Youzhi from Taiyu Group.

749
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,510
He said he'd arrange to meet me

750
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,840
after he finished the energy conference.

751
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,480
Oh.

752
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,960
You're not here to carry out

753
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,160
the tasks for this conference, are you?

754
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,710
Then you must have seen him at the scene.

755
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,150
Alright.

756
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,230
I won't trouble you anymore, Division Director Yang.

757
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,630
You go ahead with your work then.

758
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,920
Let's keep in touch over the next few days.

759
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,580
Sure thing.

760
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,850
Good luck with everything.

761
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,400
Bye.

762
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,230
J.

763
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,400
I heard you couldn't set up a meeting with Yao Youzhi.

764
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,230
We previously agreed to meet with him after he attended

765
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,280
the Capital City Energy Conference.

766
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,210
But we're worried he's just giving us the runaround.

767
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,110
If that's really the case,

768
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,800
we'll be in a passive position.

769
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,030
After all, I made him

770
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,430
suffer such a great humiliation back then.

771
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,480
Now that we've finally caught him in our crosshairs,

772
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,670
he's sure to make things difficult for us.

773
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,470
I understand.

774
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,730
But you still need to wait patiently.

775
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,320
Doesn't the energy conference end in three days?

776
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,230
Things will naturally become clear then.

777
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,190
I believe

778
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,450
he will definitely meet with you.

779
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,070
Let's hope so.

780
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,560
Alright then.

781
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,030
Oh, by the way,

782
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,650
There's one more thing.

783
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,360
Yang Guang has come to Capital City.

784
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,960
Yang Guang went to Capital City?

785
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,220
Did he go there for you?

786
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,670
No.

787
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,190
He should be here to carry out the security task

788
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,990
for the Chinese leaders at the energy conference.

789
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,490
What a coincidence.

790
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,530
Did you see him?

791
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,280
I was at an event venue

792
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,480
and saw him from afar.

793
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,670
So you two met?

794
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,880
No.

795
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,960
I just had a phone call with him.

796
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,440
Didn't he tell you he was going to Capital City?

797
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,920
He doesn't really tell me

798
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,860
about his work-related matters.

799
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,280
Zhao,

800
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,430
his identity is special.

801
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,530
It's better to be careful.

802
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I will be careful.

803
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,430
However, if he really has

804
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,070
official business in Capital City,

805
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,320
that's a heaven-sent opportunity for us.

806
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
You must seize it.

807
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,670
A new environment abroad

808
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,400
is the perfect time to warm up your relationship.

809
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,960
You must find a way to make him stay

810
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,280
in Capital City for a few more days.

811
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,320
He's here on official business.

812
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,760
It's usually not possible for him to stay longer?

813
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Where there's a will, there's a way.

814
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,140
Everything is subject to change.

815
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,960
You can do it.

816
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay.

817
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,510
I'll give it a try.

818
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,710
Hello.

819
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,370
Are you still in Capital City?

820
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,510
Yes, I'm still here.

821
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,040
The conference ends today.

822
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,840
Are you free now?

823
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,150
There's still some wrap-up work to do.

824
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,760
After that, I can return to Yanping.

825
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,510
Have you considered staying in Capital City for a few more days?

826
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,070
There's a pile of work waiting for me back home.

827
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,670
Besides,

828
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,550
it's not that easy for us to take time off.

829
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,920
I need to ask for permission from my superiors

830
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,760
and get approval from the department.
