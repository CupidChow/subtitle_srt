That car isn't on the list.

Maybe it's associated with a tenant.

245
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,920
It's hard to keep track of those who have rented cars.

00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,400
more do you want?

387
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,280
Yao,

388
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,390
neither of us

389
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,020
is the winner or the loser.

390
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,640
We're friends

391
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,000
now, aren't we?

392
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,480
Let's put

393
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,600
what happened behind us.

394
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,920
I'll ensure your safety.

395
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,220
As an apology,

396
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,610
I dropped a gift by your door.

397
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,730
Check it out in 10 minutes.

398
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,740
I'm sure you'll like it,

399
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,680
my friend.

400
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,550
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.

401
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,860
[Yanping, China]

402
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,270
Sorry.

403
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,200
I kept you waiting.

404
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,310
No worries.

405
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,880
Payment completed.

406
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,400
Okay.

407
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,070
Thank you.

408
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,680
Bye.

409
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
Welcome back,

410
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,160
my heroine.

411
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,640
Now I'm finally feeling alive.

412
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,060
I can't wait

413
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,830
to hear this legendary

414
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,590
story of yours.

415
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
Yao Youzhi got desperate

416
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and attempted to

417
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,750
record us making out

418
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,620
as leverage.

419
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,110
What a crazy man.

420
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,970
We pretended to play along.

421
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,570
Yang Guang helped me out of there in the end.

422
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,050
We luckily survived

423
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,680
all the danger.

424
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
Thanks to Yang Guang,

425
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,390
I managed to come back alive.

426
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,020
A shared near-death experience.

427
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,480
Sounds romantic.

428
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,770
Your feelings for each other have changed

429
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,180
over this trip, right?

430
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,590
Yes, indeed.

431
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,000
However,

432
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,070
I'm still not certain.

433
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,830
Of what?

434
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,790
In the Capital City, he performed

435
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,660
exactly as what an elite member

436
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,070
of the Chinese Ministry of State Security would do.

437
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,480
That's what worries me.

438
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,010
I'm not sure

439
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,000
if he was showing affection

440
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,160
or

441
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,970
just putting on an act.

442
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,350
Don't underestimate your ability and charm.

443
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,040
What do you mean?

444
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,340
With you around,

445
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,380
though Yang Guang might be pretending at first,

446
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,680
he must be truly

447
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,700
in love with you now after

448
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,280
what you went through together.

449
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,350
If you still have doubts,

450
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,110
let me deal with him.

451
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,240
You?

452
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,790
I'm going to throw

453
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,760
a celebration party at home

454
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,520
to congratulate us on becoming

455
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,310
the only PR solution provider in the Capital City's

456
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,640
nuclear power project.

457
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,830
You can

458
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,590
bring him to the party.

459
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,540
I'll help you find out

460
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,480
what feelings he has for you.

461
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,550
I can bring him along.

462
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,950
But I must say

463
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,650
that I really don't think

464
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,690
he'll agree to work for us at last.

465
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,900
He's a faithful man

466
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,990
with a strong will.

467
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,200
He's loyal, too.

468
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,350
Zhao,

469
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,350
Turning an agent is the most delicate

470
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,830
and the most complicated,

471
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,690
yet the easiest

472
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,510
part of a spy's job.

473
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,070
A spy surely has to be

474
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,470
thoroughly prepared

475
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,310
before turning an agent.

476
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,920
At the end of the day,

477
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,970
it comes down to one thing.

478
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
That is, patience.

479
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,040
My patience is not running out.

480
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,410
I just think it is hard to turn him.

481
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,310
Given Yang Guang's identity,

482
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,240
personality

483
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,300
and the training he has received,

484
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,770
it's impossible for him

485
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,550
to take our side right now.

486
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,130
All you need to do is

487
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,440
make good use of

488
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,350
your relationship with him.

489
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,720
Be his friend.

490
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,110
Or become even

491
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,160
closer to him than that.

492
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,610
Guide him to give away information

493
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,590
accidentally or intentionally.

494
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,590
Some information

495
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,170
could be

496
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,010
insignificant to them,

497
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,790
but to us,

498
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,770
it's important enough.

499
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,160
I got it.

500
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,160
I'll stay patient.

501
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,550
A toast to my heroine.

502
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,630
A toast to my work.

503
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,750
J,

504
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,650
we're the sole PR solution provider

505
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,690
for the nuclear power project now.

506
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,200
Why don't you tell me

507
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,360
about the next step?

508
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,650
When it's time,

509
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,750
I'll let you know.

510
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,750
What are you hiding?

511
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,790
Or have you never

512
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,920
trusted me at all?

513
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,310
Zhao,

514
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,370
as you know,

515
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,850
I've never distrusted you.

516
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,200
I nearly died

517
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,960
in the Capital City for this task.

518
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,590
Now, you're still refusing to tell me

519
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,850
about the entire plan.

520
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,550
Don't I at least deserve to know

521
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,160
what I'm risking my life for?

522
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,350
This is an order from the headquarters.

523
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,480
My duty is to obey.

524
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,750
We can't repeat

525
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,270
Hermes' mistakes.

526
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,110
But we are not Hermes.

527
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,880
You are not Sander Bowie.

528
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,640
James, you used to play

529
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,310
by your own rules.

530
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,500
When did you become

531
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,280
a submissive yes-man?

532
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:30,960
Zhao,

533
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,830
I promise you

534
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,480
that you'll be

535
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,200
the first one to know

536
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,350
the master plan

537
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,720
apart from me.

538
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,480
I'm wondering

539
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,510
when that day will come.

540
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,750
In a month.

541
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,030
Okay.

542
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,350
I hope you'll keep

543
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,680
your promise.

544
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
I will.

545
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,200
Go get some rest.

546
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,510
Boss,

547
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,989
the second phase is done.

548
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,360
Good job.

549
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,440
The items will be sent out in batches.

550
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,150
Due to strict customs monitoring,

551
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,630
it is divided in three parts

552
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,280
amidst import and export goods.

553
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,510
The channels vary.

554
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Don't miss anything.

555
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,280
Don't worry about us.

556
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,760
I'm ready for that.

557
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,920
You have no chance to make mistakes.

558
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,320
Also,

559
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,710
I sent to you a gift.

560
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,840
Check it.

561
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,840
Thank you, boss.

562
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,630
Tell me.

563
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,770
Any gains from the trip?

564
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,150
The trip to the Capital City

565
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,510
was very fruitful.

566
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,440
In terms of work styles and patterns,

567
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,880
Leader Group is like a typical intelligence agency.

568
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,670
On the first day I met Zhao Yaning,

569
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,470
she took me to a villa community.

570
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,480
She asked me to visit some open houses with her,

571
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,620
but in fact, she was secretly
scouting Yao Youzhi's house.

572
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,430
Later,

573
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,440
at Yao Youzhi's place,

574
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,000
she installed listening and video monitoring devices.

575
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,330
She got hold of an indecent video of Yao's,

576
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,640
and used it to

577
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,760
coerce him

578
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,980
into cooperation.

579
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,480
During the trip, I also met

580
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,340
two colleagues of Zhao Yaning's.

581
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,550
One was Taylor,

582
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,630
who handles overseas affairs.

583
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,920
The other one was Li Taiheng.

584
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,960
They struck me as spies

585
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
given their vibes

586
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,770
and the way they spoke.

587
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,030
They were said to have just returned from Turkey.

588
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,030
I suspected that they had installed

589
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,810
listening devices in my room,

590
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,210
so I was extra cautious.

591
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,670
Most importantly,

592
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,670
on our last night in the Capital City,

593
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,870
Zhao Yaning and I were

594
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,630
targeted by assassins.

595
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,550
We had no money

596
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,800
or any ID.

597
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,750
Zhao Yaning traded her watch

598
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,880
for a cellphone

599
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,280
and a stack of cash.

600
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,240
She made a mysterious call with that phone.

601
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,800
Then, in Jinchuan Airport,

602
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,630
someone

603
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,880
handed Zhao Yaning a black bag,

604
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,510
containing clothes for us

605
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,130
and two newly fabricated passports.

606
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,350
Those helped us come back

607
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,150
to China.

608
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,030
Only spies would get out

609
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,760
of trouble in that way.

610
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,710
And that's why

611
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,890
you're sure that Leader Group

612
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,360
is a spy agency?

613
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,000
It most certainly is.

614
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,170
But I need some time to find out

615
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,580
the exact nature of this organization.

616
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,440
It can be an NGO,

617
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,060
or an organization under

618
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,550
another institute.

619
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,810
I need to investigate.

620
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,940
Yao Youzhi is capable of hiring

621
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,470
hitmen in the Capital City.

622
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,260
Leader Group paid a steep price

623
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,380
to secure

624
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,130
its contract with Taiyu Group,

625
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,030
and to become the sole PR solution provider

626
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,400
for the negotiation.

627
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,290
This has gone far beyond

628
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,030
the scope of regular business cooperation, right?

629
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,760
I know what you're going to say.

630
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,820
Evidence is what you always

631
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,280
ask for.

632
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,280
You want hard evidence.

633
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,490
I'll collect some quickly.

634
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,180
No need to rush.

635
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,350
They'll give themselves away eventually.

636
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,620
You must stay friends

637
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,030
with them and keep

638
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,150
doing your job.

639
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,670
I will.

640
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,180
Jian,

641
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,110
we've contacted the foreign publisher

642
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,110
of Luca's book Embrace.

643
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,320
They sent us a reply.

644
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:49,950
Let me see.

645
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,650
Isn't he a famous new writer?

646
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,160
But...

647
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,440
75 copies were sold in the first month,

648
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,070
and 103 in the second month.

649
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,960
How come?

650
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,350
The publisher said

651
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,040
Luca appeared out of nowhere,

652
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,880
and that they hadn't cooperated before.

653
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,230
Have you found out

654
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,280
who introduced him

655
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,070
to the publisher?

656
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,110
Sander Bowie.

657
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,760
Not by chance, right?

658
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,710
I think Luca is disguising as a writer,

659
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,030
but I can't prove it yet.

660
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,760
What has he been up to?

661
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,230
When he first came to China,

662
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,470
he were staying at a hotel.

663
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,630
He then started dating

664
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,630
Xie Xiaoman, right?

665
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,030
So he moved in with her

666
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,630
to Division Director Yang's
residential complex.

667
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,960
Later on, they moved to Nanguang Complex.

668
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,230
Interesting.

669
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,610
When you play,

670
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
tilt the foot in the back a bit.

671
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,320
As you serve,

672
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,710
try deploying more power.

673
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,660
The point of contact

674
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,580
should be here on the shuttlecock.

675
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,690
Have a try.

676
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,150
Good.

677
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,030
So much better now.

678
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,880
Let's call it a day.

679
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,480
Thank you.

680
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,110
Goodbye.

681
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,150
Aren't you Xie Xiaoman?

682
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,280
What a coincidence.

683
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,540
You're Yang Guang's colleague,

684
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,560
Li...

685
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,030
Jian.

686
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,710
J-I-A-N.

687
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,920
Li Jian.

688
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,030
You play in this place too?

689
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,550
Don't you

690
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,880
usually use the court near where you live?

691
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,760
I moved.

692
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,410
This place is closer to my new flat.

693
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,330
What is Yang Guang up to lately?

694
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,440
I haven't seen him in a while.

695
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
He's stressed out

696
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,670
by business stuff.

697
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,110
You moved?

698
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,190
Where to?

699
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,150
I'll catch up with you later.

700
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,920
I have to go now.

701
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,710
My boyfriend is here to pick me up.

702
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,510
Sure. Okay.

703
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,760
Bye.

704
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,480
Who was that man?

705
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,450
His name is Li Jian.

706
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,340
He is a colleague of Yang Guang's.

707
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,110
Yang Guang is the young man you saw

708
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,190
when we moved.

709
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:21,880
Oh.

710
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,340
I remember him.

711
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,850
What did Li Jian want from you?

712
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,200
Nothing.

713
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,150
He ran into me.

714
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,230
We just had a chat.

715
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,630
I see.

716
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,010
I thought he was someone special.

717
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,550
Are you jealous?

718
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,840
How is that possible?

719
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,350
[They've found me suspicious. I need to meet with you.]

720
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,800
Here you are.

721
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,810
Xiaoman,

722
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,710
some fellow countrymen of mine

723
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,970
invited me for drinks.

724
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,030
I'm hesitating and wondering

725
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,710
if I should go.

726
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,960
You should.

727
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,880
It's not that easy

728
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
to meet people from your hometown

729
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,900
in a foreign place.

730
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,290
You should remain friends with them.

731
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,310
Why don't you join us?

732
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,790
I'm afraid not.

733
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,930
I don't drink.

734
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,860
Easy on the drinks.

735
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,720
Come back soon.

736
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,670
Okay.

737
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,540
I'll get ready for the outing.

738
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,740
[Yang Guang]
