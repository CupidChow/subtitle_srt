1
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,310
Okay. Wish you the best of luck.

2
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,200
Hello, Ms. Ma.

3
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,480
I haven't seen Taylor the whole day.

4
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,870
Can you check his whereabouts?

5
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,270
Alright, Director Yang.

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,050
Speak up.

7
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
Director Yang.

8
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,630
Taylor booked

9
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,120
a flight to the Capital City today.

10
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,430
It seems that there's an issue with Leader's business over there.

11
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,710
Go confirm if he boarded and left.

12
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,440
Understood.

13
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,520
Send the security check images

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,590
to this computer.

15
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,150
Okay.

16
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,800
Director Yang.

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,860
No abnormalities.

18
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,160
Let's check it

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,910
again.

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,650
Alright.

21
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,430
Director Yang.

22
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,160
Confirmed, no abnormalities.

23
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,570
The laptop.

24
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,750
Send the laptop images

25
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,840
to Section Chief Chen.

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Okay.

27
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,150
AI,

28
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,440
please compare the two images.

29
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,190
Hello, Director Yang.

30
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,520
According to the X-ray reflection image,

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,870
the chip in the microwave

32
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,710
and the chip in the laptop

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
are confirmed to be the same.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,240
Got it.

35
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,960
What's going on?

36
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,240
He's going through the security check.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,470
Other than that chip,

38
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,940
nothing abnormal has been found.

39
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,190
Should we let him pass or not?

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,130
Let him pass.

41
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,150
Roger.

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,870
Let him pass.

43
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,310
Got it.

44
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,630
He's gone, right?

45
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,150
Yes.

46
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,540
He only took one chip here.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,490
They'll definitely keep trying to

48
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,240
send other things to Lianhai.

49
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,010
We can follow the trail

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
and find the truth.

51
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,310
Good.

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,120
The problem is

53
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,490
where are the other items?

54
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,670
What are they?

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,190
The colleagues in Lianhai have already

56
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,160
started cooperating with us, right?

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,720
Liu Qingdong from Division 1 of Lianhai Bureau

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
is monitoring

59
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,160
and will keep us posted.

60
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,750
Got it.

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Get some rest.

62
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,040
You too.

63
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,950
You received 3 million dollars.

64
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,000
What did you see?

65
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,030
Why so happy?

66
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,630
Nothing.

67
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm hungry.

68
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,690
I want to eat something.

69
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,030
The meal's ready.

70
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,910
Let's go eat.

71
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,600
Sure.

72
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,920
I'll help you.

73
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,910
This soup is really authentic.

74
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,670
Thank you, Xiaoman.

75
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,510
Hungry.

76
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,630
I'm hungry too.

77
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,630
I see you're in a good mood today.

78
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,800
Did something good happen?

79
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,870
I can't say yet.

80
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,470
You'll know later.

81
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
I promise

82
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
it's a good thing.

83
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,790
Has the publisher...

84
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,840
responded?

85
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,870
Not yet.

86
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,290
I haven't received any new emails.

87
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,270
You seem really concerned about this.

88
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,680
You didn't care about this.

89
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,960
So I called the publisher.

90
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,480
They said

91
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,260
they haven't received your manuscript.

92
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,840
Really?

93
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,630
Sorry.

94
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,600
It's my fault.

95
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,170
I'm telling you.

96
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,270
There's a publisher

97
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,840
that promised me

98
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,150
a huge royalty.

99
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,880
This amount of money

100
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,330
is enough for us to
live in America for a lifetime.

101
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,790
So,

102
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,000
I changed my mind.

103
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,800
I don't want to publish it anymore.

104
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,260
Not publishing it.

105
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,270
We're about to go to America.

106
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,790
At this point, if I publish a book,

107
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,790
there's no time for promotional events

108
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,150
like book signings.

109
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,690
That's why I didn't submit it.

110
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,390
And honestly,

111
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,030
your translation is perfect.

112
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,270
But for Embrace,

113
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,270
I feel like there are

114
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,510
still some parts I'm not satisfied with

115
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,480
since I met you.

116
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,270
Maybe after we go to America,

117
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
I'll have new ideas.

118
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,550
That's why...

119
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,510
So why didn't you tell me earlier?

120
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,010
I've been working so hard for this.

121
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,630
Now it's all in vain.

122
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm sorry.

123
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I know you've worked so hard for this

124
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,440
for a long time.

125
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,910
I don't want to let you down.

126
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,240
But...

127
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
your efforts are not in vain.

128
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,750
Do you know?

129
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,080
Darling.

130
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,720
This book brought us together.

131
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,080
To me,

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,730
that's even more meaningful than publishing it.

133
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,600
You are what matters most.

134
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,640
Once I get the money,

135
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,030
let's go to America.

136
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,440
You can continue working,

137
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,030
and achieve even greater things.

138
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,010
As long as we're together,

139
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,240
I believe

140
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,470
there will be a good outcome.

141
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,720
But you shouldn't have hidden this from me.

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,670
I'm sorry.

143
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,350
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

144
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,670
Because

145
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,750
I plan on being with you
for the rest of my life.

146
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,840
How could I

147
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,360
hide this from you?

148
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,790
I've just been thinking,

149
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,000
trying to find the best time

150
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,270
to tell you this.

151
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,000
From now on, whatever happens,

152
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,180
don't keep things from me.

153
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,320
I promise.

154
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,270
What a scumbag.

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
The reason is

156
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,720
flawless.

157
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,480
Xie Xiaoman.

158
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,750
She's totally fallen for it.

159
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,280
She forgave him so quickly.

160
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,650
It’s quite irritating.

161
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,110
Xie Xiaoman is just an ordinary girl.

162
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
How could she possibly be his match?

163
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,510
Right.

164
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,030
What's with you women?

165
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,780
It's not the women's problem.

166
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,320
When people are in love, their IQ always drops.

167
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,790
You really know the ropes.

168
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,120
You've got experience.

169
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,150
We're young.

170
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,240
You have more experience

171
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,600
at your age.

172
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,510
Of course.

173
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,750
But let me tell you.

174
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,960
It's not about age.

175
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Do you know who I am?

176
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,440
The Prince Charming of
the dating world in Yanping.

177
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,670
I obviously have way more experience than you.

178
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,600
The Prince Charming of
the dating world in Yanping, huh?

179
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,790
I've been here for so long,

180
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,840
but I haven't seen a single woman

181
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,870
call you.

182
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,150
You...

183
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,000
Are you going to Lianhai?

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,360
Yes.

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,150
A major project is about to start

186
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,870
in Lianhai.

187
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,910
Their team is already over there.

188
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,080
The chip has also been brought to Lianhai.

189
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,360
I know them best.

190
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,100
I should go over there.

191
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,480
Who are you planning to take with you?

192
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,210
I'm planning to go alone first.

193
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,980
James and Zhao Yaning.

194
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,120
They're not simple characters.

195
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,240
They're very good at counter-surveillance.

196
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,550
I'm afraid if there are too many people,

197
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,840
it'll be easy to expose.

198
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,510
Going alone

199
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,440
actually gives me better cover.

200
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,640
Even if I get exposed,

201
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,720
I can use my relationship

202
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
with Zhao Yaning as a cover.

203
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
Now Zhao Yaning

204
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,080
is your best cover.

205
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,030
Luca is in Yanping.

206
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,000
And Li Taiheng is here too.

207
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,660
We have to monitor both sides.

208
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,030
Other people from the Division Three

209
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,160
can't leave for now.

210
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,210
Don't worry.

211
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,630
I'm not alone.

212
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,090
We have colleagues in Lianhai.

213
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,450
Director Liu will assist me anytime.

214
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,490
Alright.

215
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,790
You go to Lianhai,

216
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,510
leave Yanping's matter to Li Jian.

217
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,870
Remember.

218
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,250
The principle for this operation.

219
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,810
We can follow the trail

220
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,850
and figure out their plan,

221
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,690
but we must ensure the safety of

222
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,270
national science projects and personnel.

223
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,070
No mistakes are allowed.

224
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,090
Understood.

225
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,920
Director Liu.

226
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,240
The equipment I need.

227
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,630
You've prepared it, right?

228
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,360
Don't worry.

229
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,000
The full set of surveillance equipment is the latest model.

230
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,150
Take a look.

231
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,030
Baigi P205 military optical telescope.

232
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,760
Electronic lock picker.

233
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,890
Computer with infrared scanner.

234
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,320
Beidou Navigation Audio-Visual Kit
with Strong Magnetic Components.

235
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,180
Director Yang.

236
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,550
I've brought you

237
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,270
all the good stuff.

238
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,750
Thanks a lot, Director Liu.

239
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,310
To do a good job,
one must first have the right tools.

240
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,680
You need this

241
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,240
to deal with Leader.

242
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,339
Additionally,

243
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,790
I've also prepared

244
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,720
a low-profile domestic sedan for you.

245
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,880
There are emergency combat gear

246
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,819
and a spare phone in the trunk.

247
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,210
Thanks.

248
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,510
Look.

249
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,280
They're staying

250
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,920
at the five-star Star Sea Hotel in Lianhai.

251
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,880
Zhao Yaning is in room 2517.

252
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,750
James is in room 2519.

253
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,510
Both rooms are near emergency exits,

254
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,110
making it easy for them to escape at any time.

255
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,770
Clearly, they came prepared.

256
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,350
I want to visit the Star Sea Hotel

257
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,400
to do an on-site inspection.

258
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,070
No problem.

259
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,920
The 4th floor from the top,

260
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,130
the 1st room with a balcony is 519.

261
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,510
The adjacent room with a balcony is 517.

262
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,840
What's the 4-storey building across from it?

263
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,480
It's another hotel.

264
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,720
I'll stay there.

265
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,440
Find me a room

266
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,440
where I can directly see rooms 517 and 519.

267
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,890
I'll arrange it.

268
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,880
Hello, Director Zhang.

269
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,790
I've arrived safely.

270
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
I've started monitoring.

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,830
Good.

272
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,170
I just received the information.

273
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,880
Tomorrow at 9:40 AM,

274
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,730
Huaze Group, Taiyu Group and Leader Group

275
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,000
will meet to discuss preparations

276
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,200
for entering the Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant

277
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
at the third-floor conference room

278
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,440
of the Star Sea Hotel.

279
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,190
Copy that.

280
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,450
A sudden meeting tomorrow?

281
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Looks like Taiyu Group is in a hurry.

282
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,880
We must stay calm.

283
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,400
We need to stick to the original schedule.

284
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,410
Aren't we supposed to help them

285
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,640
speed up the process?

286
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
The items we need

287
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,190
haven't been delivered yet.

288
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,550
What should we do?

289
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,350
Is there anything you need me to do?

290
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,210
Just fulfill a publicist's duty.

291
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,110
Don't do anything else.

292
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,960
Keep it low-key.

293
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,880
Alright.

294
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,160
It hurts.

295
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,510
It doesn't hurt anymore.

296
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,240
That's good.

297
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

298
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,910
It's nothing.

299
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,160
Just an ad message.

300
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
Then why delete it?

301
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,410
Why hide it from me?

302
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,350
It was just

303
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
a spam message,

304
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,310
so I deleted it.

305
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,160
But...

306
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,830
Forget it. I don't want to talk to you.

307
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,400
Xiaoman.

308
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,520
I really didn't hide it from you.

309
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,790
If you want, you can check it.

310
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
She finally stopped being foolish.

311
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,550
I hope this time she gets it.

312
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,550
Xiaoman.

313
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,440
Xiaoman.

314
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,400
I didn't hide it from you.

315
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,790
I just received a

316
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,400
spam message.

317
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,640
I always delete spam messages,

318
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,820
so I deleted it without thinking.

319
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,790
Don't let these small misunderstandings

320
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,110
affect our relationship.

321
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,230
I didn't lie to you.

322
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,720
Please believe me.

323
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,070
I love you.

324
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,390
In the future,

325
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,050
no matter what happens,

326
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,320
don't hide anything from me.

327
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,560
Alright,

328
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,550
I promise.

329
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm speechless.

330
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,000
She's not even angry now?

331
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,440
Can Xie Xiaoman wake up?

332
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,750
I think

333
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,750
she's still hesitating.

334
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
Let's give her more time.

335
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,590
The elevators at the Star Sea Hotel
are in the middle.

336
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,000
One passenger elevator and one freight elevator.

337
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,240
The door lock is a

338
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,310
contactless smart card lock.

339
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,030
The room key is

340
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,590
a TEMIC‘s RFID card T5557.

341
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,070
The password length is 64 bits.

342
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,480
It takes about 10 seconds
to decrypt the device.

343
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,490
Got it, Director Liu. Thanks.

344
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,000
Do we really not need to send anyone for backup?

345
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
I'll be fine on my own.

346
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,090
Being alone gives me better cover.

347
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,960
Alright, stay safe.

348
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,750
I'll send someone to keep watch for you

349
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,410
and keep an eye on the meeting.

350
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,520
Copy that.

351
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,480
How's the progress?

352
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,410
Still waiting.

353
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,670
Mr. Xiang.

354
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,360
Alright.

355
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Mr. Xiang, Mr. Li.

356
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,830
The issues you raised are

357
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,400
the key points of our recent research,

358
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,160
and we already have comprehensive solutions.

359
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,830
We highly appreciate your solutions.

360
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
But

361
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,680
we still

362
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,880
hope to get a closer look

363
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,440
at the practical application of HTGR technologies.

364
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,030
Mr. Li.

365
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,960
Our original scheduled time was 4 days later.

366
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,690
It seems that

367
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,200
this is the most reasonable time.

368
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,510
After all, nuclear power technology is complex,

369
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,440
and we need enough time to prepare.

370
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,670
Mr. Xiang, what do you think?

371
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,400
Yes.

372
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,110
If

373
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,160
we stick to the original time,

374
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,000
there's no problem at all.

375
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,270
After all, we need to give you

376
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,920
a complete demonstration

377
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,680
of our technology in action.

378
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,280
Can we start 2 days early?

379
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,930
Is it possible?

380
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,960
But

381
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll need to

382
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,400
confirm with

383
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,550
the nuclear power plant first.

384
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,830
No problem.

385
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,350
The pressure from above is just too much.

386
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,200
Then, please go ahead

387
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,680
and talk to them.

388
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,880
We'll wait for

389
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,200
your reply here.

390
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,010
Alright.

391
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,550
I'll talk to them.

392
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,110
Sorry.

393
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm really sorry.

394
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,010
After communication,

395
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,770
the nuclear power plant

396
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,510
needs to consider the entire process

397
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,170
before confirming anything.

398
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,750
They'll likely

399
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,200
give an answer tomorrow.

400
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,070
No worries.

401
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,140
Let's stop here for today.

402
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,270
We'll wait for tomorrow,

403
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,640
and once we have a response,

404
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,440
we'll continue the discussion.

405
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,120
Alright.

406
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,160
Huaze Group will fully cooperate.

407
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,000
Leader Group will

408
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
follow up at any time.

409
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,640
Sorry for the trouble.

410
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,970
The pressure from above has been intense.

411
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,400
Please understand.

412
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,350
This hotel is nice.

413
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,270
The meeting wrapped up early.

414
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,180
Do you check your room every time you return?

415
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,400
Better safe than sorry.

416
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,210
Can't be afraid of the trouble.

417
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,440
I feel

418
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,640
something's really off.

419
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,760
Do you think they are watching?

420
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,030
I have a strong feeling.

421
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,030
They're nearby.

422
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,880
If there's a pair of eyes

423
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
watching us from any window,

424
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,900
it'll be a big problem.

425
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,400
Go check

426
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,410
around the area.

427
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,030
Got it.

428
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,030
I hear footsteps.

429
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,290
Luca's gone out.

430
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,760
Good, progress.

431
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,110
There's no conversation,

432
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,480
so it seems he went out alone.

433
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,880
Keep listening.

434
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,710
I'll follow him.

435
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,150
Okay.

436
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,320
Stay safe.

437
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,840
You stay safe.

438
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,590
Welcome.

439
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,230
What would you like to order?

440
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,460
Can you tell me about the menu?

441
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,920
Our avocado yogurt

442
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,090
is the most classic.

443
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,000
Alright.

444
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,510
Okay.

445
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,490
I'll take that.

446
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,440
Please scan the QR code to pay.

447
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay.

448
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,030
Here's your yogurt.

449
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,270
Thank you.

450
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,360
Would you like to order anything else?

451
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,760
No,

452
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,360
thank you.

453
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,320
Help me with this.

454
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,670
Okay.

455
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,420
I've checked around the area.

456
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,360
The only

457
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,360
possible place

458
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,510
that could be

459
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,680
monitoring our room

460
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,190
is that hotel.

461
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,510
There are 6 rooms in total

462
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,840
on the 3rd and 4th floors of the hotel

463
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,440
that can see our rooms.

464
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,630
I carefully checked.

465
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,510
I've ruled out

466
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,920
five of them.

467
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,390
There's only one room I'm unsure about.

468
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,670
I need to check it on-site.

469
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,600
Alright.

470
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,820
Don't let your guard down.

471
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,470
Don't miss any small details.

472
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,320
Okay.

473
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,530
Why's there so much noise?

474
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,640
What's wrong?

475
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,070
Xiaoman.

476
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,720
You know how much I love you,

477
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,280
right?

478
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,670
Today,

479
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,000
I have to tell you everything.

480
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm not a writer.

481
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,710
That's my

482
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,150
cover identity.

483
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,900
I never submitted the book to the publisher.

484
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,240
It was written by a ghostwriter.

485
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm really sorry

486
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,000
for not telling you this.

487
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,670
But there's one thing I didn't lie to you about.

488
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,480
I love you.

489
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,690
So who exactly are you?

490
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,630
I'm Luca Mori.

491
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,000
A man with a special job.

492
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,440
Why's there so much noise?

493
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,800
The noise just started.

494
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,150
Has Luca come back?

495
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,760
He went out for a bit,

496
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,890
bought something, and came back.

497
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,710
What is he trying to do?

498
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,650
I don't think things are that simple.

499
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,940
Intuition?

500
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,480
A woman's intuition.

501
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,420
You wouldn't understand.

502
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,190
I understand now.

503
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,480
That case about

504
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,840
Sander Bowie.

505
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,440
You and him are friends.

506
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,130
You and Zhao Yaning are also friends.

507
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,400
You all...

508
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm just your boyfriend.

509
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,670
Luca Mori.

510
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,630
Don't lie to me.

511
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,550
I'm not lying to you.

512
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,800
At first,

513
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,960
I did want to use you

514
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,110
to cover my identity.

515
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,550
But later,

516
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:58,920
I...

517
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
really fell in love with you.

518
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,440
At one point,

519
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,800
I thought

520
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,770
I'd never fall in love with anyone.

521
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,280
But you...

522
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,710
changed me.

523
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,190
I've lived so long

524
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,960
in a state worse than death.

525
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,190
But these past few months,

526
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,440
I finally realized

527
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,070
this is what life is.

528
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,110
Come with me.

529
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,670
Let's go to America.

530
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,670
Let's change this world

531
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,960
in our own way.

532
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,560
But I don't want to do bad things.

533
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,960
There's no such thing

534
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,630
as absolute good or bad.

535
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,360
I only know that

536
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,480
helping others

537
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,550
and our country is a good thing.

538
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,230
Harming others

539
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,550
and our country

540
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,280
is a bad thing.

541
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,110
Then promise me

542
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,670
you won't harm my country

543
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,230
or anyone else.

544
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,280
I promise.

545
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,030
Promise me

546
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,990
you won't lie to me again.

547
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,440
I promise.
