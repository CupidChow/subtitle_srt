And she also demanded to see the consul, right?

169
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,240

any fake passports or plane tickets.

184
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,240
They were probably destroyed as well.

194
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,610
These should all be confidential information, right?

Only internal personnel

196

197
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,190
would have access to this.

198
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,190
There is a mole inside the facility.

199
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,150
If that's really the case...

200
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,360
then this mole gave the enemy

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,620
a detailed floor plan,

202
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,090
a full shift schedule of all security personnel,

203
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,120

we still don't know yet.

How long has this mole been embedded here?

209
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,510
If that's true, then everything we do

210
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,440
is under the enemy's watchful eye.

211
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,880

212
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,200

213
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,690
we can make a bold guess here?

215
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,500

also leaked to them

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,750

00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,890
Sander is still in Switzerland.

222
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,390
If there is a mole,

223
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,810
he'll quickly learn that something has gone wrong

224
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,720
and cut off all connections immediately,

225
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840

The issue is that you helped them.

Looking at it vertically,

558
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,550
they are numbers.

559
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,780
But if we look horizontally,

560
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,510
don't they look like a pattern?

561
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,830
Here. Like this.

562
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,370
Suppose...

563
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,650
we take 0 as a dot

564
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,290
and 1 as a dash.

565
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,400

566
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,720

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,200
Can you decode this?

00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,550
Let me decode it.

570
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,080
Hurry up.

571
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,290
"Sander, don't return.

572
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,200
Liangma 3302."

573
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,760
"Sander, don't return" is understandable.

574
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,160
What does "Liangma 3302"

575
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,780
mean?

576
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,610
Search immediately

577
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,320
for all hotels,

578
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,250
residences, apartments, villas,

579
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,150
and anything containing "Liangma 3302."

580
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,150
All the addresses and information.

581
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,400
According to the search,

582
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,880
there is a Liangma Apartments outside the 3rd Ring Road.

583
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,470
It is

584
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,560
a high-rise building with more than 30 floors.

585
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,160
It's about 4 kilometers

586
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,790
from the Moss Trading Group.

587
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,590
Based on the distance,

588
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,360
I suspect it's their safe house

589
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,290
for storing documents and intelligence equipment.

590
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,590
When we get home, focus on your work.

591
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,860
I may be out of town for a few days on business.

592
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,090
Got some things to take care of.

593
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
That urgent?

594
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
It's about the publication of the new book.

595
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,710
I have to go.

596
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,940
Then come back soon, okay?

597
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,670
Okay.

598
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,870
Mr. Liu.

599
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,720
After every major meeting,

600
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,090
you would lead us in reciting "The River All Red."

601
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,510
To remind us to maintain absolute loyalty in service to our country.

602
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,110
T-The only line I can remember now is,

603
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,120
"Wrath sets on end my hair!"

604
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,490
The bureau leadership...

605
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,590
has got the news.

606
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,920
They hope you will...

607
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,800
fully cooperate with Mr. Yang Guang's work.

608
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,280
Tell everything you know.

609
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,030
Things have come to this.

610
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,210
I know what to do.

611
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,280
I will tell

612
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,150
everything I know clearly.

613
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,210
When did you first meet

614
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,940
Sander Bowie?

615
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
On August 21,

616
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,000
2018.

617
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,260
I remember it clearly.

618
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,470
It was the day my son

619
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,140
started school abroad.

620
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,400
On the day of admission,

621
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,910
our whole family was exhausted.

622
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,840
I had some business friends there

623
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,580
who invited me out for drinks.

624
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,250
They said they wanted to introduce me to a new friend.

625
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,000
That new friend is Sander Bowie.

626
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,970
That was our first meeting.

627
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,690
After that, he really helped us a lot.

628
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,400
He was genuine and calm.

629
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,610
Through his connections,

630
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,230
my son was transferred to...

631
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,970
the best local high school.

632
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,150
To make it easier for my wife to accompany our son
during his studies,

633
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,900
he even helped her find

634
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
a high-paying job

635
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,440
with a light workload.

636
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,250
Sugar-coated bullets.

637
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,960
Yes.

638
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,770
But at that time, I had no awareness at all.

639
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,800
If I had a second chance,

640
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,570
I might still fall for it again.

641
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,130
After all, my family is abroad.

642
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,190
They are my biggest concern

643
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,050
and the soft spot in my life.

644
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,990
For 3 years after that,

645
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,950
Sander didn't ask me for anything.

646
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,500
I truly thought...

647
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,590
I had made a real friend.

648
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,360
Until Mr. Sun...

649
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,440
made a breakthrough in

650
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,800
fourth-generation nuclear technology,

651
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,470
and the management and development rights

652
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,770
were assigned to Huaze Group.

653
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,340
That's when your "true friend" showed his true colors.

654
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,340
Yes.

655
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,500
But they...

656
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
didn't ask me to steal technology at first.

657
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,330
They just wanted to know

658
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,190
how far along we were in our R&D.

659
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,510
You told them?

660
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,550
I didn't.

661
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,080
I refused right to his face.

662
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,960
Because I knew

663
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,540
this was a national treasure,

664
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,820
not something to be trifled with.

665
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,470
But from that point on...

666
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,370
my wife and child's situation

667
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,070
began to change.

668
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,860
First, there were signs of strangers

669
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,150
visiting their residence.

670
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,960
Then things escalated.

671
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,850
My son suddenly disappeared.

672
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,860
He was missing for 6 hours.

673
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,450
Until Sander

674
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,130
suddenly sent my son back.

675
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,610
I immediately realized

676
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,570
that the lives of my family

677
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,480
were completely in his hands.

678
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,330
So, you started helping them

679
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,800
to steal HTGR technologies.

680
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,060
My wife and child were in their hands.

681
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,110
I had no choice.

682
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,110
So I gave in.

683
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,280
What about the Asian Nuclear Summit Forum?

684
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,070
Was it also your suggestion that Mr. Sun Yaokuan

685
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,000
bring his laptop to attend, right?

686
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,840
Yes.

687
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,840
The security measures for the No. 2 Nuclear Research Lab

688
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,480
are extremely tight.

689
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,970
I didn't agree to take that risk for them.

690
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,590
I just told them

691
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,880
that Mr. Sun's computer

692
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,660
was their only chance.

693
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,980
I originally thought they just wanted to steal the technology,

694
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,310
but I never imagined...

695
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,440
they would kill Mr. Sun.

696
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,020
You also leaked the key timeline

697
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,560
and content of the negotiations

698
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,360
with Capital City, didn't you?

699
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,400
Only some of it.

700
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,510
Because Sander's intelligence network is quite extensive.

701
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,630
Not all of it came through me.

702
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,480
I remember...

703
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,330
there was also someone from the Leader Group...

704
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,020
named Zhao Yaning,

705
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,400
who also helped him quite a bit.

706
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,800
Is Zhao Yaning

707
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,730
in cahoots with Sander Bowie?

708
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,270
I'm not sure if they're on the same side.

709
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,650
But she definitely provided some...

710
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,710
some information.

711
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,650
Tell me about this time.

712
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,720
What did you do

713
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,660
to help them this time?

714
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,080
After the technology competition was proposed...

715
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,360
Sander wanted to know our internal situation.

716
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,920
He ordered me

717
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,030
to provide the detailed floor plan of the facility...

718
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,360
and the security protocols.

719
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,850
He also wanted an access card.

720
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,080
I gave him the floor plan and the security protocols.

721
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,430
I didn't give him the access card.

722
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:32,960
Why?

723
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,410
Because I was afraid of being exposed.

724
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,510
Every access card

725
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,730
has its own code.

726
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,480
Once it's used, it's recorded.

727
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,070
I was afraid that once it was used,

728
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,730
they would trace it back to me.

729
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
But strangely,

730
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,800
they never asked me for it again.

731
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,670
Originally,

732
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,110
they planned to

733
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,300
act on the night of the 28th.

734
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,420
Unexpectedly, you strengthened security.

735
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,920
I thought they definitely wouldn't be able to get in.
