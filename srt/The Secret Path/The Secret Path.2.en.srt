1
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,039
I hope that people in the world who love the Earth

2
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,640
can unite to fight against nuclear pollution.

3
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,120
Let me

4
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,560
be the trail blazer.

5
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,040
About two minutes after the incident,

6
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,510
this video appeared on

7
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,310
online.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,130
It spread wildly across the internet.

9
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,750
The view count has now exceeded 100 million.

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,680
Mr. Daine,

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,150
could you share your thoughts?

12
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,870
Do you have anything to say?

13
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,000
What's the main content of this conference?

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,630
Regarding the content...

15
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,190
To be honest,

16
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,280
I am shocked and disappointed.

17
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,000
We came to China with sincerity

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,240
to cooperate on

19
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,960
nuclear power technology.

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,470
Before I came here,

21
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,840
I was full of confidence we can

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,560
have an exchange based on mutual goodwill.

23
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,470
In my eyes,

24
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,120
China is one of the safest countries in the world.

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,850
It's a shame.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,710
China has successfully advanced to the fourth generation...

27
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,590
May I ask what

28
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,910
the main content of this conference is?

29
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,800
Sir...

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,120
As for future cooperation

31
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,030
and construction of

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,840
nuclear power plant between us,

33
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,870
given the recent emergence of different opinions,

34
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,080
I think it's best we put it on hold for now.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,280
What are your thoughts on

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,540
Wang Xiaoquan's case?

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,590
Hello?

38
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,280
Connect me to the Ministry of State Security.

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,710
Ms. Ma just called.

40
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,710
She said this Wang Xiaoquan is

41
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,640
just a radical environmentalist.

42
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,800
But for his other information,

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,460
we still need to investigate.

44
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,829
How's the situation with Chairman Xie?

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,150
He's been rescued,

46
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,000
but is still in a coma.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,360
He was confirmed to be poisoned.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,150
He's now undergoing the second stage of treatment.

49
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,210
What about Division Director Liang?

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,970
Division Director Liang's situation

51
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,840
is not that optimistic.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
He's still not out of danger.

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,640
The knife wound was too deep.

54
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,270
When will Chairman Xie's toxicology results

55
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,070
be available?

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,659
Tomorrow morning.

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
Have Wang Xiaoquan's family members

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,810
and social connections

59
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,159
been investigated yet?

60
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,360
Before the Jiangcheng Conference began,

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
his wife and daughter

62
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,830
suddenly left their hometown.

63
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,040
Their whereabouts are currently unknown,

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,700
but we're still finding them.

65
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,720
The background check has already been coordinated

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
with the Jiangcheng Bureau.

67
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,360
It might be a bit late.

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
Let's hope it's not too late.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,870
This is for your medical expenses

71
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,270
and living expenses.

72
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,070
The password is your child's birthday.

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,430
How long until

74
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,600
we can see Xiaoquan?

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,270
Two hours to international waters.

76
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,780
Xiaoquan is already waiting for you on the cruise ship.

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Slow down.

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,390
Be careful.

79
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Captain,

80
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,830
make sure to deliver them safely there.

81
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,030
Don't worry about it.

82
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,920
Sir,

83
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
my car needs to be repainted.

84
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,110
I'll be there in half an hour.

85
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,950
Okay.

86
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,330
Chairman Xie was poisoned with cyanide.

87
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,070
The poison was not in the drink,

88
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,270
but on the cup.

89
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,430
This is a type of high-level toxin

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,070
commonly seen in past cases.

91
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,000
Based on your professional judgment,

92
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,000
what are the chances of saving him?

93
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,400
There's still a good chance of saving him.

94
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,240
Chairman Xie's condition has basically stabilized.

95
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
When will he regain consciousness?

96
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,270
The situation is quite complicated now.

97
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,800
It depends on many factors.

98
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,970
It could be soon, or it could take a very long time.

99
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,670
Before leaving, I promised Director Zhang

100
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,320
that the Division Three wouldn't let him down.

101
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,750
This was really not your fault.

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
Don't blame yourself.

103
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,890
We don't have time for self-blame now either.

104
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,290
Jiangcheng,

105
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,290
conference,

106
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,120
and attack.

107
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,310
This is the intelligence we intercepted

108
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,190
from the Military Intelligence Bureau through Liu Lijing.

109
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,390
Wang Xiaoquan is an environmentalist.

110
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,790
To protect environment,

111
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,070
he chose to kill people,

112
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,600
which just doesn't make any sense.

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,130
Director Zhang also told us

114
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,480
that this was a conference

115
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,000
with a very high level of secrecy.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,750
Even the two of us

117
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,680
only knew it the night before last.

118
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,000
So how did the Military Intelligence Bureau

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,390
know about it in advance?

120
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,909
And how did Wang Xiaoquan

121
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,390
infiltrate the Shiji Hotel beforehand?

122
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,450
He couldn't have done all this alone.

123
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,120
Yes.

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,960
There must be a powerful force

125
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
behind him to

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,150
support him.

127
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,060
Who could it be?

128
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,910
Which floor is the preparation room on?

129
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,910
On the 20th floor.

130
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,840
Chairman Xie is in trouble.

131
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,700
He's in coma. Signs of poisoning.

132
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,480
20th floor.

133
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,380
How is she everywhere?

134
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,760
Where are you going?

135
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,070
The car is over there.

136
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
Drive over here to find me.

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,200
My goodness.

138
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,480
You really suspect that woman?

139
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,630
The conference's location is on the 21st floor.

140
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,560
But she's living on the 20th floor.

141
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,550
Wang Xiaoquan's preparation room

142
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,950
is also on the 20th floor.

143
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Shortly after she left the hotel yesterday,

144
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,210
Chairman Xie got into trouble.

145
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,200
Today she appeared again

146
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
at Chairman Xie's hospital.

147
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,720
She has strong counter-surveillance skills.

148
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
She's not an ordinary person.

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,390
So I strongly suspect

150
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,610
that this woman

151
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
is Wang Xiaoquan's accomplice.

152
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,790
The ID she used for check-in

153
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,650
was a passport.

154
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,870
She lived in room 2008.

155
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,550
Records show that five hours ago,

156
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,080
she had already checked out

157
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,240
and left the hotel.

158
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,510
According to the information provided by the hotel,

159
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,600
this Zhao Yaning

160
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,320
has booked a flight to Yanping.

161
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,790
It'll take off in half an hour.

162
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,320
She's probably returning to
Lide Group's China headquarters.

163
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,750
Division Director Yang,

164
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,030
should we take action

165
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,560
against Zhao Yaning?

166
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,040
Let's not alert her for now.

167
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
Notify the department

168
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,030
to send someone to monitor the airport.

169
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,270
First, confirm if this Zhao Yaning

170
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,870
really returned to Yanping.

171
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,510
Then, let's see

172
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,970
what her next move will be.

173
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,760
Understood.

174
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,360
Division Director Yang,

175
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
there's new progress on Wang Xiaoquan's case.

176
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,750
Go on.

177
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
Based on leads provided by nearby residents,

178
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
we found the car that picked up his wife

179
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,110
and daughter in the surveillance footage.

180
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,840
The car drove all the way

181
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,630
to coastal road No. 9 and disappeared.

182
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,480
That area is an abandoned dock.

183
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,670
That night, someone who got up to use the bathroom

184
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,440
heard the sound of a fishing boat leaving.

185
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,510
Our assessment indicates that

186
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,440
high probability the targets

187
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,150
have departed by vessel to international waters.

188
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,720
We've already sought help

189
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,030
from the maritime police.

190
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,430
There're no results yet.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,260
Let's plan for the worst-case scenario.

192
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,870
Have you found the driver

193
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,790
who picked them up?

194
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,960
The driver disguised himself.

195
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,080
We couldn't extract any facial images.

196
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,810
Afterwards,

197
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,620
the car never appeared again.

198
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,480
It's very likely

199
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,480
that it has been repainted

200
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,340
or disposed of.

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,200
That's definitely the work of professionals.

202
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
This Wang Xiaoquan,

203
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,390
when

204
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,120
and how did he start to

205
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
work for Shiji Hotel?

206
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,720
He was hired a month ago

207
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,020
through a normal interview process.

208
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,600
Here's his file.

209
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,270
He worked as a part-time ride-hailing driver?

210
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,790
Yes, he worked for six months.

211
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,250
Getting hired a month ago.

212
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,960
This means that a month ago,

213
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,720
the enemy had already obtained

214
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,780
information about this conference.

215
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,080
Such crucial information

216
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,550
can only come from two sources:

217
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,000
First, the negotiating parties.

218
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,880
Second, the hotel management.

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,320
Keep up the good work.

220
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,360
Continue digging deeper into this Wang Xiaoquan.

221
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,110
It would be best if you could find

222
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,440
his external communication methods

223
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
and his contacts.

224
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,200
Also,

225
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,840
after getting approval from superiors,

226
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,770
carefully investigate her tracks

227
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
in Jiangcheng.

228
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,550
If there's any development,

229
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,510
let's summarize it at any time.

230
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,240
Understood.

231
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
The doctor just said,

232
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,240
Liang's vital signs have gradually stabilized.

233
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,360
However, after being stabbed,

234
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,590
he suffered hypovolemic shock,

235
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,930
causing severe oxygen deprivation to the brain.

236
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,260
It's possible that

237
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,850
it will take a very long time for him to wake up.

238
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,080
Attention!

239
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,320
Salute!

240
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,320
This report of yours

241
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,270
is all about speculation

242
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
without any substantial evidence.

243
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,750
I always say

244
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,680
security work involves complex leads.

245
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,170
How to distinguish truth from falsehood?

246
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Evidence comes first.

247
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,730
This operation has failed.

248
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,490
Our Yanping Division Three

249
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,080
bears inescapable responsibility.

250
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,140
Director Zhang, allow me to explain.

251
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,630
We...

252
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,760
Failure is failure.

253
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,440
If you want to explain, go to the hospital

254
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,640
and explain to Chairman Xie and Division Director Liang.

255
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,980
Yang Guang,

256
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,150
I personally

257
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,550
recruited you back then.

258
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,350
I trust you very much.

259
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,440
But as I always said before,

260
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,380
without evidence,

261
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,490
everything goes back to nothing.

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,460
I request your permission

263
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,510
to put Zhao Yaning under surveillance temporarily

264
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,440
to determine whether we can rule her out as a suspect.

265
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,970
Yes, you can.

266
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,090
But your authorization is limited to

267
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,330
surveillance only.

268
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,790
[Business dinner, Zhanshan Hotel Western Restaurant]

269
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,069
Hello? Can you come to my place?

270
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,359
Bro, you're looking for me?

271
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,109
Let's go.

272
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,790
Leaving right after my arrival?

273
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,000
Zhao Yaning has a business lunch

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,349
at Zhanshan Hotel Western Restaurant

275
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,480
today at noon.

276
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,110
Let's have our meal there too.

277
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,310
We're having Western food?

278
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,910
Are you in?

279
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,440
A couple of burgers and you call it Western food?

280
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,770
I'll get you a salad too.

281
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,480
Can I have juice?

282
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,680
Oh my.

283
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,410
It's already twelve o'clock,

284
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,790
and they haven't arrived yet.

285
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,120
Are you sure about this?

286
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,640
There's still six minutes left.

287
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,960
Zhao Yaning is a PR person,

288
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,000
so she won't be late.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Be patient and wait a bit longer.

290
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,030
Oh my.

291
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,760
They arrived.

292
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,750
This way, please.

293
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,830
The man with slicked-back hair in a black suit

294
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,830
is called Sander Bowie.

295
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,200
He's the CEO of Moss Trading Group.

296
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,770
The woman next to him

297
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,750
wearing a suit

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,270
is called Shelly.

299
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,000
She's the Vice President of Moss Trading Group.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,270
What's the situation with their company?

301
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,000
There are no records

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,240
of any intelligence or espionage activities.

303
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,880
They are a multinational company

304
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,310
engaged in international trade.

305
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,680
It's registered on the Kuwei Islands.

306
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,590
They have

307
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,840
a separate office building in Yanping.

308
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,920
What about the one next to Zhao Yaning?

309
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,050
The man in a gray suit

310
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,040
with white hair,

311
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,640
walking with a cane?

312
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,370
He is called James.

313
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,350
The CEO of Lide Group,

314
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,080
and Zhao Yaning's boss.

315
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
How relaxing she is.

316
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,910
She's texting on WeChat.

317
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,200
Looks like she's waiting for someone?

318
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,410
Someone's coming.

319
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,790
Xie Xiaoman?

320
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,480
Xie Xiaoman?

321
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,790
Is that the tennis friend from your neighborhood?

322
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,450
That's her.

323
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,750
I remember you mentioned that

324
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,270
Xie Xiaoman is a foreign language translator.

325
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,270
You must know her quite well, right?

326
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
On weekends,

327
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,690
we often play tennis together.

328
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,070
I know some basic information about her.

329
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,670
She's just an ordinary girl.

330
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,830
Easygoing

331
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
and carefree.

332
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,660
How could the two of them know each other?

333
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,110
Xiaoman,

334
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,960
are you home?

335
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,510
I just got back from a business trip.

336
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,680
I brought you a gift.

337
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,240
If you're in, I'll bring it over to you.

338
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,750
There's a foreign writer

339
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,310
named Luca Mori.

340
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,160
His novel "Embrace"

341
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,100
is going to be published in China.

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,640
He's looking for a Chinese translator.

343
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,040
And I have already passed

344
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,830
the initial selection.

345
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,160
That's impressive!

346
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
So this notebook

347
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
contains your translation notes?

348
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Yes, impressive, right?

349
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
For that Lu something

350
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,550
or something like that,

351
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,880
I've really never heard of him.

352
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,510
His name is Luca Mori.

353
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
He's a new writer.

354
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,480
As you know,

355
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,950
our company is full of talented people.

356
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,960
At first,

357
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,750
I didn't expect much from it

358
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,350
and sent the translated passage to give it a try.

359
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,640
But unexpectedly,

360
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,310
I passed!

361
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,900
How did you get so lucky

362
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,680
to have this fall into your lap?

363
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,070
Looks like you've got some amazing help behind you.

364
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,310
Of course.

365
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,640
Which company is it?

366
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,110
In case I know someone there,

367
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,720
I could put in a good word for you.

368
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,050
It's called Lide Public Relations Group.

369
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,060
I never heard of it.

370
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't know them.

371
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,170
The person in charge is her.

372
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,880
Her name is Zhao Yaning.

373
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,310
She's a real beauty.

374
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,220
Do you want me to introduce you to her?

375
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,180
Are you close with her?

376
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,030
Have you known her for a long time?

377
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,830
We've only known each other for a short time.

378
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,000
I met her through this project.

379
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
So, how is she?

380
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,070
Is she good?

381
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,240
Let me tell you, in person,

382
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,960
she's really beautiful.

383
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,470
She has a great demeanor and is very polite.

384
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,110
She looks very kind at first glance.

385
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,840
That's good.

386
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,680
You're very punctual.

387
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,310
Why didn't Sander come with you?

388
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm here to handle the connection.

389
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,590
After the Jiangcheng incident,

390
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,030
the contents of related conferences from multiple countries are here.

391
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,160
The reactions vary.

392
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,500
China's reaction is very strong.

393
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,680
[250 thousand dollars has been received]

394
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,960
Wish a pleasant cooperation.

395
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,680
Likewise.

396
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,350
Wait.

397
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,790
These two seem to be on your tail.

398
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,960
Is everything alright on your end?

399
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,960
Thank you.

400
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,680
Alas.

401
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,680
Thanks so much.

402
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,000
You're finally here, bro.

403
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm starving.

404
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,640
Eat while it's hot.

405
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:16,970
Okay.

406
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,770
There's soy milk here.

407
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,000
How is it?

408
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,310
I have confirmed with

409
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,240
their security guards,

410
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,040
and their property management.

411
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,930
That's the one.

412
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,350
Look at the direction I point at.

413
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,150
Building 188,

414
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,400
Unit 2, Room 701.

415
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
See those four "happiness" symbols?

416
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,480
Her home is just

417
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,210
diagonally up to the right.

418
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,480
Any unusual?

419
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,720
Nothing at all.

420
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,360
Hello?

421
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,510
Alright, I got it.

422
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,960
I'll be right there.

423
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
You just got here and you're leaving?

424
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,880
Stay with me for a while, bro.

425
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,550
Why don't you keep me company instead?

426
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,000
The recheck results for Chairman Xie are out.

427
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,660
Tan Yaoduo,

428
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
give me your car keys.

429
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,310
We'll drive your car to get there.

430
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,790
You stay here and keep an eye on Zhao Yaning.

431
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,240
Sure.

432
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,070
Last night,

433
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,400
we conducted further tests

434
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,550
on Chairman Xie's blood sample.

435
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,310
The conclusion is consistent with that

436
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,170
from the Jiangcheng laboratory.

437
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,310
Chairman Xie's heart disease symptoms

438
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,680
were indeed caused by

439
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
cyanide poisoning.

440
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,200
The poison caused the cells

441
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,030
to release a large amount of hydrolase,

442
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,030
resulting in cardiac wall rupture and cardiac tamponade,

443
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,960
which led to heart failure.

444
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,110
But cyanide

445
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,900
has a very distinct smell.

446
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,590
Didn't Chairman Xie notice anything

447
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,960
when he was drinking the cola?

448
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,420
Theoretically speaking,

449
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,720
cyanide can be specially processed

450
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,880
to be colorless and odorless.

451
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,440
What do you think their purpose was

452
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,160
in poisoning Chairman Xie?

453
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,220
Daine, what benefit could this have?

454
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,790
The incident at the Jiangcheng conference

455
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,920
suspended China-EU nuclear cooperation.

456
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Who benefited from it

457
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,770
is the one behind the scene.

458
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,590
By that logic,

459
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,620
every rival nation opposed to

460
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,510
China's rise

461
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,570
would have motive.

462
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,790
The logic is clear now.

463
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,780
Let's hurry and find the culprit.

464
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,720
You're really getting old.

465
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,550
You're driving so slowly,

466
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,010
just like my second uncle.

467
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,350
What are you doing?

468
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,070
I told you to drive faster,

469
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,160
but not to drift.

470
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
Someone's following us.

471
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,850
A black Volkswagen.

472
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,640
Since we left the lab,

473
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,720
it's been behind us.

474
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,440
Two people in the car.

475
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,550
I can't see their faces clearly.

476
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,310
Think of a way

477
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,560
to observe them up closely.

478
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,070
Over there.

479
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,750
Do you even know how to drive?

480
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,550
Slow down in the parking garage.

481
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Did you remember the license plate?

482
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,350
Got it.

483
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,130
Let's check it out.

484
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,200
Thanks.

485
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,670
I found it.

486
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,960
That license plate belongs to this car rental company,

487
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,070
but the original car is still being repaired at the garage.

488
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,720
So the car that followed us

489
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,960
was using a fake plate.

490
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,160
It'll take some effort to investigate.

491
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,840
Whoever this person is,

492
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,270
be careful when returning to the office recently.

493
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,930
We're already being watched.

494
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,160
Do you think

495
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,970
it could be Zhao's people?

496
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,470
Anyway, it's related to recent events.

497
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,550
The two of them stayed in the neighborhood for a while,

498
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,000
and then I saw them head it to another place.

499
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,790
It's a chemistry lab.

500
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,110
A chemistry lab?

501
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,400
But what're they doing there?

502
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,440
I have no idea.

503
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
They were there for just

504
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,640
under 30 minutes.

505
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,240
Then?

506
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,550
I followed them to Wusi Mall

507
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,210
underground parking garage.

508
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
Then we got spotted.

509
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
So we got out of there.

510
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,130
They saw you?

511
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,550
Absolutely not.

512
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,830
I've already had someone

513
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,880
get rid of the car,

514
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,590
without a trace as usual.

515
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,960
Good work.

516
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Hold back for now.

517
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,040
We don't want to draw attention.

518
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,030
Are you so sure

519
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,960
that Zhao Yaning is suspicious?

520
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,620
Intuition.

521
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,170
Have you heard of Murphy's Law?

522
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,720
You're suggesting a result to yourselves

523
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,200
that Zhao is problematic.

524
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,160
Then you keep pursuing this result,

525
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,440
expecting an outcome,

526
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,740
while overlooking many important related things.

527
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm more eager than you to get answers,

528
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,310
but national security agencies

529
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,720
must act according to the law,

530
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,450
not investigate arbitrarily.

531
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,880
I've told you before,

532
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,000
the truth

533
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,080
is often not on the surface.

534
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,210
I remember.

535
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,880
For Jiangcheng's side, the investigation results

536
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
for Wang Xiaoquan are out.

537
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,270
What did they say?

538
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,480
He's not at all

539
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,740
an environmentalist.

540
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,920
He's from North Town,

541
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,560
an orphan.

542
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,409
He grew up with his grandparents.

543
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,690
Three years ago,

544
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,130
grandparents passed away due to illness.

545
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,150
He then brought his wife, Hu Shufen,

546
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,710
from their hometown to Jiangcheng.

547
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,840
They have a daughter

548
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,020
who has a congenital disease.

549
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,190
I'd like to ask if Hu Shufen has any relatives.

550
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,389
She's also an orphan.

551
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,670
After Wang Xiaoquan arrived in Jiangcheng,

552
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,190
he did many low-level jobs.

553
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,469
Later, through a neighbor's introduction,

554
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,000
he got his driver's license

555
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,670
and became an assistant to a ride-hailing driver,

556
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,440
working night shifts

557
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,699
as a part-time driver.

558
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,670
Two months ago,

559
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,630
he suddenly quit his job.

560
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,760
His account increased by 50,000 yuan.

561
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,840
A month ago,

562
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,480
he started working as a waiter at the Shiji Hotel.

563
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,010
Before entering the hotel,

564
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,070
he sent his wife and daughter back to their hometown in North Town.

565
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,150
Have we checked Wang Xiaoquan's

566
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,360
dashcam from when he was

567
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,510
a ride-hailing driver?

568
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,710
It's all been erased.

569
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,950
But later, Wang Xiaoquan

570
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,550
kept changing his phone,

571
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
and with his wife and daughter's disappearance,

572
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
connecting all these together,

573
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,890
the most likely scenario is

574
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,160
he was used by spies.

575
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,480
What I want to tell you is

576
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:11,970
the truth

577
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,310
is not on the surface.

578
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,160
Many people have multiple layers,

579
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,320
Wang Xiaoquan is just an example.

580
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,180
Not to mention,

581
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,190
a female senior executive of a large PR company,

582
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,190
like Zhao Yaning.

583
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,840
Understood,

584
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,670
Chief.

585
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,840
Zhao's situation is very special.

586
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,000
If we don't use some technical investigation methods,

587
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,630
it's difficult...

588
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,090
First peel off her layers.

589
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,960
We'll then discuss using technical methods later.

590
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,220
I won't approve it now.

591
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,400
Understood.

592
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,100
Because of these days,

593
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,540
Division Director Yang and I have been following Zhao.

594
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,670
There are some suspicions,

595
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,070
but nothing conclusive.

596
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,320
We applied to Director Zhang for

597
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,510
technical investigation, but he rejected that.

598
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,440
So, let's discuss

599
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,230
if there are any

600
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,090
other methods.

601
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,790
Let's brainstorm together.

602
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,710
Why don't we just use it secretly?

603
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,770
As long as we don't get caught, right?

604
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,760
Who are you?

605
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm Tian Ziwei.

606
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,710
This is the new employee

607
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,910
in our Network Technology Department,

608
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,150
assigned by the bureau.

609
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,630
She's an expert in network technology.

610
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,230
And today is her first day at work.

611
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,560
Assigned by the bureau?

612
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,690
Impressive.

613
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,510
That Ziwei?

614
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,920
Tian Ziwei.

615
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,300
Let me tell you,

616
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,630
some things

617
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,590
are a matter of principle.

618
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,710
Don't be arbitrary.

619
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,920
Alright, let's get down to business.

620
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,840
Let's assign the tasks.

621
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,760
I'll go make some connections.

622
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,360
I'll check on Lide's situation.

623
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,920
Then I'll look into her personal relationships.

624
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,000
As for Tian and I,

625
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,440
we'll figure something out

626
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,960
to see if we can technically

627
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,190
enhance the video from Jiangcheng

628
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,250
to make it clearer.

629
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,710
And also, we will

630
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,130
search for other clues.

631
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Isn't that still using technology?

632
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,510
I see.

633
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,160
This girl, she's really...

634
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,840
Then it's settled.

635
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,530
Alright.

636
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,280
For lunch today,

637
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,760
to thank you all,

638
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,670
order whatever takeout you want.

639
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,470
It's all on me.

640
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,460
Can we really order anything we want?

641
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,230
Why this girl is so naïve?

642
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,290
Can you believe it?

643
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,760
Didn't you say that?

644
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,670
Oh my, I...

645
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,800
Really, order whatever you want.

646
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,630
Comrade,

647
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,590
work hard.

648
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,710
And also,

649
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,290
keep it confidential.

650
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,670
Mr. Luca,

651
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,280
this is Miss Xie Xiaoman.

652
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,360
Hello.

653
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,230
I'm Luca Mori.

654
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,360
Ms. Zhao,

655
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm so happy.

656
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,590
Mr. Luca says

657
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,000
he likes my translation.

658
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,360
There's a strong bond between you.

659
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,550
So I'll just leave you here.

660
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,150
If there's any news,

661
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,880
I'll let you know immediately.

662
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,590
Sure.

663
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,090
Be more confident.

664
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,930
You're a great translator.

665
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,830
Keep it up.

666
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,040
Thank you.

667
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,840
Goodbye, Ms. Zhao. I'll wait for your news.

668
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,760
Ms. Zhao,

669
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,190
Mr. Zhan went back to the headquarters for something urgent.

670
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,280
He specifically instructed me

671
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,010
to hand this to you personally.

672
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you.

673
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,280
On April 20th,

674
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,250
the Asian Nuclear Energy Conference

675
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,710
will be held at the Yanping Conference Center.

676
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,230
The city committee wants us

677
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,880
to cooperate with Yanping police and the organizers

678
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,810
to handle the conference security

679
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,490
and intelligence support.

680
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,150
Is that a problem?

681
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,850
No problem.

682
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,230
This nuclear energy conference

683
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,290
is very important.

684
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,450
Our country currently possesses

685
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,920
the world's safest

686
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,740
4th-generation nuclear power technology.

687
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,840
Our nuclear energy technology

688
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,230
is extremely safe

689
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,450
and produces very little nuclear waste.

690
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,510
The value of this kind of technology

691
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,370
should be clear to you.

692
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,480
At the Jiangcheng Conference,

693
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,630
foreign parties were interested in cooperating with us,

694
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,090
but because of the reasons

695
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,510
we all know,

696
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,870
it was forced to stop.

697
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,040
So this time's conference,

698
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,630
it's the top priority of our security work.

699
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,580
We can't afford any mistakes.

700
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,310
-Understood. -Understood.

701
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,440
Put aside other work for now,

702
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,030
and focus all efforts on

703
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,670
the security work for this nuclear energy conference.

704
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,230
Yes!

705
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,840
Last year,

706
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,960
we accepted

707
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,510
a mission from the Group

708
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,510
to do all we could to stop

709
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,230
Chinese nuclear technology from becoming dominant.

710
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,000
We then spent 3 months

711
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,560
recruiting Liu Lijing,

712
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,190
waiting for the result.

713
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,370
During that time, we found her actions were too rush.

714
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,760
We had a backup plan,

715
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,440
ending with Wang Xiaoquan's death.

716
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,670
We managed to stop their nuclear energy cooperation temporarily.

717
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,930
Wang Xiaoquan, right?

718
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,710
Yes.

719
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,670
Congratulations,

720
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,730
you've been hired.

721
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,150
This is the contract.

722
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,410
Please sign your name.

723
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,880
Thank you.

724
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,590
Right now,

725
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,190
China is hosting the Asian Nuclear Energy Conference

726
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,280
to work close with others.

727
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,840
If they succeed,

728
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,230
China and other countries

729
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,190
will be closely interconnected in energy industries,

730
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,390
paving the way for deeper cooperation.

731
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,670
And energy is the lifeblood of our planet.

732
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,960
So we need to

733
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,420
stop this once and for all.

734
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,760
What did you have in mind?

735
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,840
Chinese nuclear energy expert, Sun Yaokuan,

736
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,670
is our best shot.

737
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,960
The important documents we need

738
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,440
can only be found in Chinese No.2 Nuclear Research Lab

739
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,710
and on Sun's laptop.
