1
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,680
Mr. Yang.

2
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,610
I'd better just call you Youliang.

3
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,079
I find you very interesting.

4
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,310
It's rare these days to see someone...

5
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,120
who clips a pen to their shirt pocket.

6
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,079
It's just a habit.

7
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,590
Does it make me look very old-fashioned?

8
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,870
I'll take it off, then.

9
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,800
No, no.

10
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,680
I...

11
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,520
I actually like...

12
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,520
traditional men.

13
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
We've brought our connection from the internet into real life.

14
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm really happy today.

15
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,150
In internet terms,

16
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,670
this is what they call an "online friends meetup."

17
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,710
Your outfit today is very retro.

18
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,880
I think it suits you quite well.

19
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,840
This is...

20
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,160
a new outfit I bought specially.

21
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm guessing your size is

22
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,079
52A, right?

23
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,590
Miss Liu, you're amazing.

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,960
You even got the "A" right.

25
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,190
Be careful, the steps are slippery.

26
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,630
Okay.

27
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,520
Good thing the rain has stopped.

28
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

29
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,150
We'll need to go through a security check to enter here.

30
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,960
No problem.

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,910
Please put your carry-on bag through security.

32
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,240
Okay.

33
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,760
Turn around.

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,530
Turn around.

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
Sorry, it's a bit of a hassle.

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
Please don't mind it.

37
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
No, it's normal.

38
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,250
Is it finished?

39
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,990
Thank you.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Thank you.

41
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,630
This way, please.

42
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,230
Please come in, Miss Liu.

43
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,040
This way.

44
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,430
This is my laboratory.

45
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,630
It's so big.

46
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm sorry. It's a bit messy.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,540
Let me tidy up a bit.

48
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,390
It's okay. Take your time.

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
My lab

50
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,270
has never had any other visitors before.

51
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,430
Then I'm honored.

52
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,750
Just a moment, please.

53
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,240
Okay.

54
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Mr. Yang.

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,950
I like you.

56
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,870
Do you like me?

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,480
Miss Liu.

58
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,430
This is a laboratory.

59
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,440
This isn't appropriate.

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I think...

61
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,070
that's what makes it more exciting.

62
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,510
Would you like to copy all the files?

63
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,950
Hello.

64
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,000
Hello.

65
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,240
What are the last four digits of your phone number?

66
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,000
2483.

67
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,600
2483.

68
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,120
Then we'll follow the GPS directions.

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,630
Okay.

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Sir, please hurry. I'm in a rush.

71
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,480
Alright.

72
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,070
Who are you people?

73
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,430
Don't move!

74
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,830
Don't move!

75
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,750
Let go of me!

76
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,430
Let go of me!

77
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,160
Let go!

78
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,040
Let go!

79
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,310
Don't you recognize me already?

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,950
Yang Youliang?

81
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm from the Yanping State Security Bureau.

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
My name is Yang Guang.

83
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,000
Liu Lijing.

84
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,720
You were born in 1988.

85
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,320
Native of Changchun City, Jilin Province.

86
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,390
Intelligence Officer of the Mainland Action Team

87
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,990
for the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau.

88
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,280
Two and a half years ago,

89
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,560
you infiltrated Yanping City,

90
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,980
using various methods

91
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,170
to contact mainland researchers

92
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,470
in an attempt to steal

93
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,240
critical intelligence information

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,500
in the mainland's nuclear energy field.

95
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,810
Do you have any explanations for this?

96
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,059
Six months ago,

98
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
you met

99
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,960
Professor Yang Youliang

100
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,630
from Yanping University of Science and Technology online.

101
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,030
During those six months,

102
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,480
you pursued him

103
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,910
fervently online.

104
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,390
We have obtained

105
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,590
all your call records

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,130
and chat histories,

107
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,600
including evidence of your criminal activities

108
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,840
against him.

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
I advise you

110
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,490
to stop wasting time here.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

112
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,270
And I have nothing to say.

113
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I find you

114
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,380
very interesting.

115
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,480
It's rare these days to see someone...

116
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,840
who clips a pen to their shirt pocket.

117
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,360
It's just a habit.

118
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,480
Does it make me look very old-fashioned?

119
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,790
I'll take it off, then.

120
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,670
No, no.

121
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,510
I...

122
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,550
I actually like traditional men.

123
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,080
Is this how you treat...

124
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,750
the men you like?

125
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,720
Why?

126
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,700
How did you manage to do it?

127
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,070
When your bag passed through security,

128
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,150
we swapped it.

129
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,720
Turn around.

130
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,880
This one on the table

131
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,030
is the one you originally brought in.

132
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,960
The substance inside is propofol.

133
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,550
While this one

134
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,120
is the one you injected me with.

135
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,480
The substance inside was only ordinary glucose.

136
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,320
Are you surprised

137
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
that we could make

138
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,560
an exact replica in advance?

139
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,430
Because your handler has been captured.

140
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,030
He confessed everything...

141
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,680
including your criminal patterns

142
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,510
and your usual methods.

143
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,920
Today, every one of your criminal acts

144
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,920
has been recorded on video.

145
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
So whether you confess or not

146
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,100
doesn't really matter much to us.

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,750
But it matters a lot...

148
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,640
for your sentencing.

149
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,720
I hope you'll think it through carefully.

150
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,750
Hello?

151
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,210
Alright, alright.

152
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,790
No problem. I gotta go.

153
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,370
I've arrived at the office.

154
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,430
Have you found anything?

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,790
This is

156
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,250
the data decrypted from Liu Lijing's phone.

157
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Besides the data she copied

158
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
from Yang Youliang's computer,

159
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,240
we also found an email

160
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,320
in her phone's mailbox

161
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,250
that she hadn't had time to delete.

162
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,320
After opening the email,

163
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
we found a string of numbers:

164
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,630
3126724.

165
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,130
It looked like an old-fashioned cipher to me.

166
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,510
So, I immediately cross-referenced it

167
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,870
with the standard cipher books

168
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,600
for matrix codes commonly used

169
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,840
by the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau

170
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
around 1950 during wartime.

171
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Finally, I've decoded three words.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,860
"Jiangcheng,"

173
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,600
"Conference,"

174
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,400
and "Attack."

175
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,810
Jiangcheng.

176
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,600
Conference?

177
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,110
And there might be an attack?

178
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,240
Is there any conference in Jiangcheng?

179
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,770
The Jiangcheng Conference

180
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,270
is a highly classified meeting

181
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,690
for exchange and cooperation

182
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,480
between Chinese and European energy enterprises.

183
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,280
The attendees

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,600
are all leading representatives from

185
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
the Chinese and European energy industries.

186
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,240
The head of the European delegation, Daine,

187
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,370
currently serves as

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
the vice president of the European Economic Promotion Association.

189
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,550
He's a prominent figure in European politics and business.

190
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,010
The head of our delegation

191
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,940
is Xie Rujun, the chairman of the Jiangcheng

192
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
International Trade Association.

193
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,760
Chairman Xie

194
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,240
left

195
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,600
the national security system 10 years ago

196
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,390
and entered the business world.

197
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,270
Over the years, he has been actively promoting

198
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,790
international economic exchange and cooperation.

199
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,990
Logically speaking,

200
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
the Military Intelligence Bureau shouldn't be

201
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,840
interested in such a business meeting.

202
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,390
Indeed.

203
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,670
How could a business meeting of this level

204
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,120
attract spies?

205
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,390
Because this meeting

206
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,440
will discuss very special content

207
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,480
that has been

208
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,080
strictly confidential to the outside.

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,880
What content?

210
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
Nuclear power cooperation.

211
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,960
If that's the case,

212
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,670
it all makes sense.

213
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,210
The representatives from both sides

214
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,200
will discuss

215
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,240
nuclear power cooperation matters at the meeting.

216
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,790
That's why this meeting is highly confidential.

217
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,550
Before this,

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,480
the Jiangcheng Bureau had already made arrangements

219
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
to collaborate with the police and armed police

220
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,240
for level-one security.

221
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,290
Director Zhang,

222
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,460
"Jiangcheng,"

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
"Conference," and "Attack"—

224
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,480
how reliable are these clues

225
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,630
we have?

226
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,010
Could it all just be a false alarm?

227
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,150
Liu Lijing's identity

228
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,280
has been confirmed.

229
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,230
She is, indeed, a spy.

230
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,600
This code was found

231
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,000
in her work email.

232
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,320
And our technical investigation department

233
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,910
used a codebook from the 1950s

234
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,770
to decipher it.

235
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,000
It's better to be

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,930
safe than sorry.

237
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,500
We absolutely cannot let our guard down.

238
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,910
Director Zhang, in my personal opinion,

239
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,840
we should immediately

240
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
share the intelligence

241
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,360
we have with Jiangcheng.

242
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,720
Moreover, we should send a team over.

243
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,600
After all, these leads were obtained

244
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
during our operation

245
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,690
on the Yanping espionage case.

246
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,240
It's our responsibility to send our people there.

247
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,200
At the same time,

248
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,670
we can also assist Jiangcheng

249
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,240
in ensuring the safety of this conference.

250
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
What do you think?

251
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
There are less than ten hours left

252
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,690
before the conference starts.

253
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,030
Do you have the confidence

254
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,720
to work with the Jiangcheng Bureau

255
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,910
to resolve this issue?

256
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,440
Division Three has never let you down, right?

257
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,270
Good.

258
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,510
Since it involves

259
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,630
the personal safety of key figures from both sides,

260
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,960
Yanping Division Three

261
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,790
will form an emergency task force.

262
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,120
You'll be the team leader,

263
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,390
and Li Jian will be the deputy leader.

264
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,870
Fly to Jiangcheng immediately.

265
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,200
Fully cooperate with

266
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,790
the work of the Jiangcheng State Security Bureau.

267
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,390
Two tasks:

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,400
First,

269
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,390
maintain the stability of the conference.

270
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:12,850
Second,

271
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,670
eliminate any potential

272
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,050
espionage incidents.

273
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,270
Division Director Liang Sihan of

274
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,360
the Jiangcheng State Security Bureau

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,000
is the highest-ranking official responsible

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,670
for overseeing security in this matter.

277
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,530
I'll notify him

278
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,490
to receive you.

279
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,410
How many times do I have to tell you?

280
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,870
Can we serve fruits that aren't fresh?

281
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,750
Look at this yourself!

282
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,010
Look at this yourself.

283
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,100
Can we serve something like this?

284
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
The guests are very picky, you know!

285
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't know how you made it through training.

286
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,510
So clumsy.

287
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
Excuse me, sorry.

288
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,560
Thank you.

289
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,070
Please wait a moment.

290
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,590
Okay.

291
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,000
Division Director Liang,

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
they're here.

293
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,510
Division Director Yang,

294
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,440
I've heard a lot about you.

295
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm Liang Sihan, from Jiangcheng.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,480
Yang Guang, from Yanping Division Three.

297
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
The honor is mine.

298
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Time is tight.

299
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,400
You're all up to speed on the situation, right?

300
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,830
About five hours ago,

301
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,160
we received news from Yanping.

302
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,830
We immediately set up surveillance

303
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,920
inside and outside the Shiji Hotel.

304
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,200
We've also been continuously audio monitoring and collecting

305
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
information from in and around the venue,

306
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
filtering for sensitive keywords.

307
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,550
So far, we haven't found any sensitive information.

308
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,200
The identity verification of all attendees

309
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
has also been completed.

310
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,080
This is a compilation of all the materials.

311
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,910
Thank you for your hard work.

312
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,530
For safety reasons,

313
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,750
the 21st floor of the hotel

314
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,720
has been completely sealed off

315
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
and is temporarily out of use.

316
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
No unauthorized personnel are allowed to enter.

317
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,310
We have also arranged designated passageways

318
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,440
and exclusive elevators

319
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,500
for the delegates.

320
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,880
The conference

321
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
is scheduled to start at 10 AM

322
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,920
and will last for three hours.

323
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,850
Around 11:30 AM,

324
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,960
there will be a brief

325
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,110
tea break.

326
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,350
We've arranged

327
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,770
all the relevant staff.

328
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,370
Additionally,

329
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
the security team has conducted

330
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,310
a comprehensive

331
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
scan and inspection of the venue.

332
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,680
No issues were found.

333
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,590
Would it be convenient for us

334
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,450
to inspect it together once more?

335
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,650
You don't trust my security team?

336
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,070
No,

337
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,920
it's not that I don't trust them.

338
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,830
I just think

339
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,160
the conference venue

340
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,510
is of utmost importance.

341
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,590
We'll cooperate with you

342
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,070
to conduct a second inspection,

343
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,930
just to be safe.

344
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,640
After all, the intelligence this time

345
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,100
doesn't look optimistic.

346
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
What do you think?

347
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Okay.

348
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,790
These pieces of furniture

349
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,310
have been recently replaced.

350
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,200
Last week, the hotel

351
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,160
uniformly replaced a batch of

352
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,110
internal equipment and office furniture.

353
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,070
We've

354
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,510
inspected every item thoroughly.

355
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,440
No problems were found.

356
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,840
Thanks for your efforts.

357
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,310
Here are the records.

358
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,030
How do you need us to cooperate?

359
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
We'll be responsible for the front line,

360
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,720
and your Division Three will handle the second line,

361
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,550
working with the security team to guard.

362
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,000
You've dealt with the TMIB before,

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,270
so you have a better grasp of the situation.

364
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,400
The main task now

365
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,160
is to prevent

366
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,830
any spies

367
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,430
from approaching the venue.

368
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,540
No problem.

369
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,930
Where's Jiang? Why isn't he here?

370
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,790
We don't know

371
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,590
where he went.

372
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,510
He didn't come back

373
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,640
all last night.

374
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,000
He mentioned something

375
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,440
about an emergency at home.

376
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,110
If he had a family emergency,

377
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,240
why didn't he ask for leave in advance?

378
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,310
Forget it. Never mind.

379
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,170
Let the backup personnel fill in.

380
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,070
De,

381
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,270
Tang,

382
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,810
and Wang Xiaoquan.

383
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,110
You three

384
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,110
will be responsible for today's tea break service.

385
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,400
You'll be serving important guests.

386
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
Just follow

387
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,400
the training we've had before.

388
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,550
The tea break is scheduled for 15 minutes.

389
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,950
You need to be professional and efficient.

390
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,030
Understand?

391
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,550
Okay.

392
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,640
Go get ready.

393
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,260
How's it going?

394
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,480
We've connected to the hotel's CCTV system.

395
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,740
Everything is normal.

396
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,720
Tan, Tan, can you hear me?

397
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,830
I can hear you.

398
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,000
First to arrive at the scene, the parking lot.

399
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,510
Is the security assurance complete?

400
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,830
The security team has cleared a special passageway.

401
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,640
Everything is normal.

402
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,240
Copy that.

403
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,200
Ms. Ma,

404
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,960
what's the situation with you and Li Jian?

405
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
The 21st-floor conference room has been sealed off.

406
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
Venue secured.

407
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,960
Copy that.

408
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,790
The vehicles have entered.

409
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,790
I see them.

410
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
The Chinese representatives have arrived.

411
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
No. 2, copy. No. 2, copy.

412
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,110
Attention all teams, attention all teams.

413
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,480
The European representatives have arrived.

414
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,030
Representatives from both sides have arrived.

415
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,030
They're entering the venue now.

416
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,160
Preparing to begin the conference.

417
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,090
No. 2, copy that.

418
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,130
No. 2, copy that.

419
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,310
Welcome to Jiangcheng.

420
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,640
Welcome to Jiangcheng.

421
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,640
It's great to be here, and it's also great to be in China.

422
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,570
I like it here, and I like China too.

423
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,070
I hope we can have a good outcome today.

424
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,330
Please have a seat.

425
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,170
Please, sit.

426
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,480
No. 2, No. 2, this is Position One.

427
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,210
All monitoring is in place.

428
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,350
The 21st floor has been internally sealed off.

429
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,920
The conference will officially start in two minutes.

430
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,180
Everything is normal.

431
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,310
No. 2, copy that.

432
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,830
The meeting will officially begin in two minutes.

433
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,090
Everything is normal.

434
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,650
Let's hope it's just a false alarm.

435
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,710
Some nuclear leak incidents

436
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,880
has people around the world protesting nuclear power.

437
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,960
Some nuclear leakage incidents

438
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,830
have caused worldwide...

439
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,400
They simply don't understand

440
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,550
that nuclear power is the future.

441
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,680
They simply don't understand

442
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,540
that nuclear power is the future.

443
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,590
Time will prove everything,

444
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,310
my friend.

445
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,590
Time will prove everything,

446
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,310
my friend.

447
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,240
I believe

448
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,790
that safe and advanced fourth-generation nuclear power technology

449
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,720
can change all of this.

450
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,880
Can completely change all of this.

451
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,830
I know that your

452
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,200
fourth-generation nuclear power technology

453
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
is almost finished.

454
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,350
Well, maybe already done.

455
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
I believe we can definitely cooperate on this.

456
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,200
Or even already completed.

457
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,000
Chairman Xie,

458
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,880
the world is awaiting our cooperation.

459
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,800
The world is looking forward to our cooperation.

460
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,370
There's an old Chinese saying:

461
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,220
"It is a great pleasure to have friends come from afar."

462
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,720
As long as it benefits China-Europe relations

463
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,830
and advances the progress

464
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,240
of the world,

465
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
we Chinese people

466
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,040
welcome it wholeheartedly.

467
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,590
Here is what I'm thinking:

468
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,830
you push hard to promote your fourth-generation nuclear power technology

469
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,830
across Asia, even globally.

470
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,310
We'll focus on the marketing and funding side of things.

471
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,830
After all, we have stronger relationships worldwide.

472
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,110
So,

473
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,480
we'll cover operations,

474
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,610
you'll take care of the technological aspect of things.

475
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,550
What do you think?

476
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,720
That's impossible.

477
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,270
The core technology was independently developed by us,

478
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,470
so we should be primarily responsible for the operation.

479
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,790
Mr. Daine, it's time for the tea break.

480
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,000
Why don't we take a break,

481
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,200
have some drinks,

482
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,590
and continue our discussion later?

483
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,520
He's terminating the conference until we come back.

484
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,110
Mr. Daine, I hope you recognize

485
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,030
the importance of firmly promoting the concept of win-win cooperation

486
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,590
and steadfastly ensuring regional peace and stability.

487
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,720
Only then will we have a better future.

488
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,240
Whiskey, please.

489
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,220
A glass of whiskey.

490
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,510
I'm sorry,

491
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,240
we don't serve alcohol here.

492
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,440
No alcoholic served.

493
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,790
I'll have a Coke.

494
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,070
Cola.

495
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,790
Alright.

496
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,550
Thank you.

497
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,170
I'll have a cup of black tea.

498
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,350
What would you two like to drink?

499
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,960
Water.

500
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,370
Mineral water.

501
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,930
Okay, thank you.

502
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
Black tea and Coke.

503
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,550
The taste is very different,

504
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,280
but the color is quite similar.

505
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,980
Just like the two of us,

506
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,350
with different skin colors and from different countries,

507
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,510
but we share a common pursuit:

508
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,590
to make the world a better place.

509
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,830
Mr. Daine,

510
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,960
why don't we exchange our drinks?

511
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,680
Just to experience each other's cultures

512
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,240
and to understand each other's thoughts.

513
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,680
It's an interesting interpretation.

514
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,480
Sure, let's do it.

515
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,590
That beautiful woman in blue

516
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,830
who was in the same elevator with us earlier.

517
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,830
On the 20th floor.

518
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,790
She seems to have made quite an impression on you.

519
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,480
Seeing her twice in such a short time.

520
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,210
Why don't you hurry up and get her WeChat account?

521
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,830
Chairman Xie.

522
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,400
We've considered your proposal.

523
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,790
Now, we really would like it if you'd consider ours.

524
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,310
We are

525
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,510
constructing nuclear power plants against public opinion.

526
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,640
Before I came here, our president made it clear about our bottom line.

527
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,750
Any line can be changed.

528
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,240
Nothing stays the same forever.

529
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,880
Mr. Daine,

530
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,480
I'm not feeling well.

531
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,830
I need to rest.

532
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,440
Chairman Xie! Chairman Xie!

533
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,750
Chairman Xie!

534
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,510
Chairman Xie!

535
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,910
Somebody, call a doctor!

536
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,720
Doctor!

537
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,720
Doctor!

538
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,830
Make way!

539
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,000
Chairman Xie!

540
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,590
Something's wrong with Chairman Xie.

541
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,030
Unconscious, showing signs of poisoning.

542
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,890
Where is he now?

543
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,580
He's being taken downstairs.

544
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,070
Mr. Daine and other representatives

545
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,000
have been arranged in the suites on the 15th floor.

546
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,160
I didn't let them evacuate.

547
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,750
I suggest that we wait until the investigation is complete

548
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,550
before letting them go.

549
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,510
Alright, this matter must be handled discreetly.

550
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,960
Division Director Liang, Division Director Liang?

551
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,440
Two of the three waiters

552
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,030
you're looking for

553
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,030
are already waiting in the office for your questioning.

554
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,750
But the other one,

555
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,280
we can't find him anywhere.

556
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,000
What's his name?

557
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,890
Wang Xiaoquan.

558
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,640
Where did he go after the tea break?

559
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,110
He seemed to have gone to the preparation room.

560
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,230
Which floor is the preparation room on?

561
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,920
The 20th floor.

562
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,650
Lead the way.

563
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,010
This is the preparation room.

564
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,690
Wang Xiaoquan!

565
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,060
You check that way.

566
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Suspect spotted!

567
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,920
Division Director Liang,

568
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,180
where are you, Division Director Liang?

569
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,970
Someone, come here...

570
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,070
Someone...

571
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,130
Someone, come here.

572
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,360
Someone...

573
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,590
25th floor, stairwell,

574
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,880
send someone here quickly!

575
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,550
Hurry!

576
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,320
Upstairs...

577
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,700
Where the hell are all the people?

578
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,360
Who are you really?

579
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,600
That waiter, Wang Xiaoquan,

580
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,320
was brought in as a backup for the old waiter

581
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,440
for tea break work.

582
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,180
This was all premeditated by him.

583
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,630
Hello?

584
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,670
Division Director Yang,

585
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,270
something big has happened.

586
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Hello, everyone.

587
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,400
My name is Wang Xiaoquan.

588
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,150
By the time you see this video,

589
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,890
I will have already gone to heaven.

590
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,320
I planned and carried out this

591
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,490
assassination of foreign officials.

592
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,880
I have dedicated my life to

593
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,550
protecting our green Earth.

594
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,630
So I devised

595
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,230
this assassination plan.

596
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,000
Though my life has ended,

597
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,710
my beliefs live on.

598
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,440
I hope that people around the world who love the Earth

599
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,880
can unite to resist nuclear pollution.

600
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,510
Let me...

601
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,960
fire the first shot.

602
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,440
About two minutes after the incident,

603
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,920
this video appeared

604
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,710
online.

605
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,780
It's spreading wildly across the internet.

606
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,070
Now... the view count has already surpassed 100 million.
