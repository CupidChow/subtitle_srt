So we can confirm that

349
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,640
it definitely changed its plate.

350
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
But these 23 cars

351
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,280
are heading towards

352
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,370
different places.

353
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,550
So we need to know

354
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,220
the specific information of each car

355
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,920
before we can know

356
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,400
which car has two plates...

357
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,860
I don't need to know these.

358
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,880
I just want to know

359
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,030
how long it will take.

360
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,750
At least an hour.

361
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,030
The ownership details, driver's licenses,

362
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,500
and file numbers of all 23 vehicles

363
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
must be thoroughly cross-checked.

364
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
And at this time,

365
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,010
some car owners are asleep.

366
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,030
There's no way to be even faster.

367
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,720
If there's no way, think of a way!

368
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,240
OK.

369
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,160
What are you doing, bro?

370
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,080
They are not easier than you.

371
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,630
There's only one step left until the final answer.

372
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,330
Once Sander Bowie escapes,

373
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,720
he'll return back to the crowds.

374
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,110
If we want to catch him again,

375
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,110
it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

376
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,240
That's even harder.

377
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,680
Everything we did before

378
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,960
may be wasted.

379
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,750
Yes.

380
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,790
But I want to say,

381
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,240
since we can get him

382
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,200
out of the crowd,

383
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,090
we can definitely block him in the crowd.

384
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,660
I believe Division Three,

385
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,480
and I trust you more.

386
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,880
So at this moment,

387
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,480
you need to give everyone confidence and courage.

388

389

Sander got the plate of

Yan MT0622 Audi.

395
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,070
One hour and 35 minutes ago, it entered

396
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,470
Yanha Expressway from Bailu Toll Station,

397
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,350
and headed all the way north.

398
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,550
It's still on the way.

That's right.

400
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,410
It's him.

401
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,550
He got to Yanha?

402
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,270
An hour to the north at such a high speed.

403
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,350
Where is he going?

404
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,050
If he exits from the north,

405
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,090
he's heading to the three northeastern provinces.

406
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,960
Will he leave China by departing from the northeast?

407
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,620
Did work scramble your brain?

408
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,680
What's outside the three provinces of northeast China?

409
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,240
He just came back from Moscow,

410
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,120
and he's going back again?

411
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,310
So he's going to the three provinces of the northeast.

412
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,170
Then why did he go back to Yanping?

413
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,140
Maybe the city he's heading to

414
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,590
doesn't have direct flights from Moscow.

415
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,960
So he has to go back to Yanping first

416
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,220
before driving north.

417
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,750
So, where in the Northeast is he heading?

418
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,100
Get the map out.

Lianhai.

420
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,790
Lianhai has a a branch company of Moss.

421
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,510
In the last technical competition,

422
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,350
they specifically chose Lianhai.

423
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,880
It means they are very familiar with Lianhai.

424
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,220
Sander Bowie goes to Lianhai.

425
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,170
There must be something very important,

426
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,770
so he has to do it personally.

427
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,450
And heading east from Lianhai,

428
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,610
he'll be not far from international waters.

429
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,200
He went to Lianhai...

430
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,640
Could he escape by sea?

431
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,880
Highly likely.

432
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
He went all the way

433
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,720
just to confuse us.

434
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,400
If he goes to Lianhai,

435
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,360
he will turn to Shen Hai Expressway.

436
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,790

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,110
Division Director Yang.

521
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,630
The comparison is successful.

522
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,950
Sandry dressed up as an old lady

523
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,280
and got on a black Nissan.

524
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,790
The license plate number is Lian FMY330.

525
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,200
[Director Liu]

526
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,750
Director Liu, please go ahead.

527
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,590
Division Director Yang.

528
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,590
The black Nissan car Sander driving

529
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,000
passed Nanjiang toll station

530
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,330
about a hour and half ago

531
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,400
and entered the city,

532
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
heading towards Jinzhou Business Area.

533
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,410
Finally,

534
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,720
it entered the villa area of Tianli Manor.

535
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,790
Which unit is it exactly?

536
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,720
I'm not sure yet.

537
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,550
Director Liu, please

538
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,760
check the records of the House Bureau

539
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,590
and see if we can

540
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,780
find some clues through

541
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,030
the registered information of the homeowner.

542
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,640
We'll go to Tianli Manor right away.

543
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,000
OK.

544
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,390
Luca.

545
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,480
Thankfully, you told me about it.

546
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,160
You don't have much time.

547
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,360
The Ministry of State Security have got their eyes on you now.

548
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,650
I have your escape route prepared.

549
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,250
Once you leave the villas,

550
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,110
head to the pier at the port.

551
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,280
Rick'll be on the Kuwei ship.

552
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
You'll be safe once you're on board.

553
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,720
How about you?

554
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,530
They haven't found me yet.

555
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,750
I’m safe.

556
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,280
Luca.

557
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,310
I came all the way

558
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,750
just to give this to you.

559
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,230
And this has

560
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
some of the documents

561
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,240
Sun's computer hold a nuclear technology

562
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,610
and the copy

563
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:38,780
of all the intelligence we were given

564
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,880
for the past few years. You're holding

565
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,920
nearly all of the Hermes.

566
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,750
Luca.

567
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,720
Do we remember all that?

568
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,960
We must climb to the top of the world.

569
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,130
My friend.

570
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,310
And my brother.

571
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,440
Don't be hesitated, just keep going.

572
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,900
It's very dangerous here.

573
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,550
But we have to split up.

574
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,960
This is a new phone.

575
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,900
My number is already in it.

576
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,170
We must stay in contact in this way.

577
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:25,790
Okay.

578
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,310
Just to be safe, we should

579
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,670
split up now.

580
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,170
Go on.

581
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,440
Luca.

582
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,110
See you soon.

583
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,750
I'll wait patiently for a chance to

584
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,510
bring these files back safely.

585
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,780
You're my brother.

586
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,140
We'll definitely meet again.

587
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,630
[People of State Security are getting close, run now]

588
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,389
Damn it!

589
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,870
Check the weapons.

590
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,500
Wang Hong, front door.

591
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,550
Liu Weijian, back door.

592
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,880
The three of us'll go in.

593
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,790
Be careful.

594
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,880
Sander drove away.

595
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,550
Stop!

596
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,190
Contact Lianhai Station.

597
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,930
Request their support.

598
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,180
Keep an eye on Sander Bowie's car.

599
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,840
Division Director Yang.

600
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,240
Say it.

601
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,760
The suspect's car is heading towards

602
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,960
Dayaowan Port offshore terminal area.

603
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,440
Roger.

604
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,210
Start navigation.

605
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,490
The entire journey is 4 kilometres,

606
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,290
and it'll take about 13 minutes.

607
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,590
Rick.

608
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,670
Hurry.

609
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,880
Coming!

610
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,560
We found Sander Bowie's car.

611
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,760
On the north side of the old port.

612
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,470
But he's gone.

613
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,270
Come here now.

614
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,290
Copy that.

615
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,490
We'll be there soon.

616
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,480
Set off!

617
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,560
Stop the ship!

618
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,750
Stop! Stop!

619
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,840
I asked you to stop the ship, why you didn't?

620
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,920
Don't move!

621
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,270
Stop!

622
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,100
Why didn't you stop the ship when i asked?

623
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,340
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
I didn't hear you.

625
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,590
What do you want to do?

626
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,550
I'm from the Yanping State Security Bureau.

627
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,980
I suspect you have a criminal on your ship.

628
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,330
I'm conducting a search immediately.

629
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:06,770
Stop!

630
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,450
How is that possible?

631
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,840
You must have misunderstood. We're a legally registered ship

632
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,570
that complies with the declaration procedures.

633
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,010
You have no right to search my ship.

634
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,690
This is China's territory.

635
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,400
I have the right to enforce the law.

636
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,290
Stop the ship!

637
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Okay, okay, okay.

638
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,920
Get to the shore!

639
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,590
Okay.

640
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,660
This is my last warning.

641
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,010
Stop the ship!
