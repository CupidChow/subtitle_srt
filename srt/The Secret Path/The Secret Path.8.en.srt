is very well connected there, you know? You know what I mean?

23
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,840

every step of the way.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,000
You made the Whale an author

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,660
so that he can secure us

36

37
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,150

39
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,750

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,200
okay?

195
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,790
Do you know why

196
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,510
I chose you as my translator?

197
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,120
Why?

198
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,800
Because when I read

199
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,180
your translation abroad...

200
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,030
I clearly felt...

201
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,440
the purity behind the words.

202
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,080
Purity is a person's

203
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
most noble quality.

204
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,440
At that moment, I knew

205
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,050
this translator could definitely do it.

206
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,750
Only you

207
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,000
can fully express

208
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,630
everything I want to convey

209
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,150
in "Embrace."

210
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,140
We are the same kind of people.

211
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,870
Come in.

Go ahead.

214
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,550

departing tonight at 10:30.

217
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,760
Sander Bowie is going to Switzerland?

[May 27, 8:15 PM]

219
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,440
Let me confirm with you:

220
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,350
Air China flight CA931,

221
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,750
transferring in Frankfurt

222
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,270
to Lufthansa flight LH1198

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,730
and arriving in Zurich tomorrow morning at 6:30.

224
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,240
Your luggage is oversized.

225
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,920
You'll need to check it

226
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,960
at the oversized baggage counter.

227
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,110
Baggage counter? Where is it?

228
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,440
Go straight ahead

229
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,110
and then turn left. It's right there.

230
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,770
Straight ahead and turn left.

231
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,480
Yes. Have a nice trip.

232
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,240
Thank you.

233
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,660
Hello, please place your luggage up here.

234
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,570
Here's your passport. Please take it.

235
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,350
Goodbye.

236
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,820
Tan Yaoduo, Zhang Lei.

237
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,720
You two follow them.

238
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,320
Division Director Yang.

239
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
They really seem to be going skiing.

240
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,700
Full gear and everything.

241
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,400
The technical competition is in three days,

242
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,860
and they're this relaxed?

243
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,530
Looks like they're confident of winning.

244
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,510
It really doesn't make sense.

245
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,750
But they've passed through security and are flying.

246
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,010
How long is the flight?

247
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,400
Eight and a half hours.

248
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,000
They'll land at 6:30 AM Beijing time tomorrow.

249
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,110
Do you think

250
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,000
they might be fleeing?

251
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,620
Given the current situation,

252
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,760
they have no need to flee yet.

253
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,560
From our dealings with them,

254
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,400
we've learned that Moss Trading Group

255
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,960
operates very meticulously

256
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
and leaves no traces.

257
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,390
Otherwise, we wouldn't still

258
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,500
have only a bit

259
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,980
of evidence against Duke.

260
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,830
If they fled now,

261
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,750
everything they've done before

262
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,960
would be wasted.

263
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,350
Then there's only one possibility.

264
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,890
They're creating a diversion while making their real move elsewhere.

265
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,680
Whatever their plot is,

266
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,800
one thing is crystal clear:

267
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
their target is

268
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,070
the 4th-generation nuclear power technology.

269
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,160
They already pulled

270
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
a misdirection stunt back in Lianhai.

271
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
We must be extra cautious this time.

272
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,110
Contact our colleagues in Zurich

273
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,830
to confirm their whereabouts and

274
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,160
notify the Huaze Group to raise their guard.

275
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,490
Okay.

276
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,240
It's like a dream.

277
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,260
I'm actually being...

278
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,680
with my favorite idol like this.

279
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,080
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,030
In front of you,

281
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,720
I'm not some idol.

282
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm just a man who likes you.

283
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,310

284
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,160

To meet my parents?

287

That's too soon.

288
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,380
Sometimes with the wrong person,

289
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,970
even waiting forever is too soon.

290
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,780
But with the right person,

291
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,680
no matter how early, it's not too soon.

292
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,870
Right?

293
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,480

are you from Northeast Jilin?

363
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,830
I didn't tell you that.

364
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,510

To top that off,

446
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,590
there's a tracking system in it.

447
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,160
It traces back to the user.

448
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,240
In other words, once the card is used,

449
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,920
the tracking system will find out

450
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,620
who the user is.
