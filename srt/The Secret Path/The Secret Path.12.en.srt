This is a real turn-up for the books!

176
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,830
It sure is.

177
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,490
So what do you plan to do today?

178
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,470
I have a dinner appointment.

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,310
A dinner appointment?

180
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,000
Tell me, tell me.

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,330
Who's going to be there?

182
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,890
Yang Weimin.

183
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,240
Li Qingchun.

184
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,630
Who's Li Qingchun?

185
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,570
Darling.

186
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,120
Our son is back.

187
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,870
Son.

188
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Mom.

189
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,000
Son.

190
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Why didn't you send a message when you got back?

191
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,190
Come here, let me give you a hug.

192
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,270
I wanted to surprise you.

193
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,680
I've missed you so much.

194
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
Alright, alright, alright.

195
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Oh, right.

196
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,430
I bought you some fruit.

197
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,040
And this milk.

198
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
Remember to drink it.

199
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,970
You bought the bananas I love.

200
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,270
Son,

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
you seem to have lost weight.

202
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,680
I don't think so.

203
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,830
You have.

204
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,630
By the way,

205
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,560
I'll make you

206
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,600
your favorite Coca-Cola chicken wings.

207
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,430
No need, I'll just have a quick bite.

208
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:24,920
Wait.

209
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,840
Alright.

210
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,159
So you still remember how to come back home.

211
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,419
Thought you'd forgotten where home was.

212
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,010
If you're going to talk like this,

213
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,840
should I

214
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,750
just leave now?

215
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,940
You're getting worked up now, huh?

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,750
It's been so long,

217
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,550
and you didn't even

218
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,750
send a message home

219
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,240
to check on us.

220
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,450
I was wrong.

221
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,270
I'll definitely change next time, okay?

222
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,550
That's more like it.

223
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,290
Have you gotten tanned?

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,480
Must have been soaking up the sun in Sanya.

225
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,940
Really?

226
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,850
Isn't getting darker a sign of health?

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,520
Sure.

228
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,720
As long as you're happy.

229
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

230
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,750
At the

231
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,030
Asian Nuclear Summit Forum held this April,

232
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,720
Mr. Sun Yaokuan, a meritorious Chinese nuclear power expert,

233
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,630
unfortunately passed away from a sudden heart attack after the meeting.

234
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,030
It attracted a lot of attention at the time.

235
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,170
After a thorough investigation

236
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,520
by our Ministry of State Security,

237
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,870
it was finally determined that

238
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,360
Mr. Sun's death was not natural.

239
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,630
This incident was carried out by

240
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,440
the non-governmental intelligence organization Hermes.

241
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
Their aim was to steal our country's latest

242
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,000
4th-generation nuclear power technology.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,870
Does this have anything to do with you guys?

244
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,150
Did you handle this case?

245
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,600
No.

246
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,980
It seems the situation is quite complex.

247
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,050
There are quite a few bad people around us.

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
It looks like the security work

249
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,900
is indeed very important.

250
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,480
When did you

251
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,410
become so politically conscious?

252
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,970
Watch how you talk.

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
I, your old man,

254
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,510
have always been highly conscious.

255
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,080
Don't think that just because I've been retired for so long,

256
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,030
I'm still our neighborhood's

257
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,840
active security volunteer.

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,670
So in your old age, you've finally realized your dream, huh?

259
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,070
It's not quite like that.

260
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,120
Your team members

261
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,550
are all a bunch of old ladies, right?

262
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,320
Go away.

263
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,270
Don't worry so much about being the captain.

264
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,670
Take care of your and mom's health instead.

265
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,960
We know.

266
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,440
Have you decided

267
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,310
where you want to go next for fun?

268
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,720
Go open the door.

269
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,820
You almost ran into me.

270
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,660
Uncle, Auntie,

271
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,810
Li Jian is here.

272
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,720
I bought you some things.

273
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,120
Welcome.

274
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,000
Just coming is fine,

275
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,960
buying things is really unnecessary.

276
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,000
No need to change shoes.

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
You have your own home, why don't you go there?

278
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,140
What are you doing at our house?

279
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,440
My parents went on a trip.

280
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,910
I came to your house to mooch a meal.

281
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,510
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

282
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,720
Shake hands.

283
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,470
I smelled the braised dish and came right over.

284
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,510
This kid has a really good nose.

285
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,720
It's delicious.

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,850
That's six already.

287
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,080
Eat less.

288
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,080
Can't you leave some for my parents?

289
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
No need, no need, no need.

290
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Eat as much as you like.

291
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,390
At our age,

292
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,150
we need to control our eating.

293
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,630
Right?

294
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,510
Here.

295
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,030
Have another one.

296
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Look how generous uncle is.

297
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,750
Look at you, so stingy.

298
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,000
Eating still can't shut you up, huh?

299
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's seven now.

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,870
Eat more,

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Li.

302
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,080
How's it going

303
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,440
with finding a girlfriend?

304
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,030
I...

305
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm not in a hurry.

306
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,150
Yang Guang isn't in a hurry,

307
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,150
so why should I be?

308
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,120
My mom's asking you.

309
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,980
Why are you dragging me into this?

310
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
So neither of you has one.

311
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,690
Your uncle and I were discussing earlier,

312
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,960
we were thinking

313
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,320
of selling this house

314
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,150
and buying two apartments

315
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,150
a bit further out.

316
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,690
One for us to live in,

317
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
and the other for Yang Guang

318
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
as a marital home.

319
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,200
But since he's not finding a girlfriend,

320
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
our wish

321
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,670
won't be realized anytime soon.

322
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,790
Really.

323
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,050
Don't worry about my business.

324
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm doing fine.

325
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,510
Taking care of your health

326
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,060
is the biggest help for me.

327
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,310
As for relationships,

328
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,070
they can't be rushed.

329
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,690
How can parents not be anxious?

330
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,480
What about my dad?

331
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,530
When he married you,

332
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,910
he was already in his thirties.

333
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,960
In your era,

334
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,220
he was considered an older bachelor,

335
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,670
right?

336
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,910
I was busy with work back then.

337
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,510
Come on,

338
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,710
it was because you were poor.

339
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,890
I was the only one who didn't mind.

340
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
A factory security guard

341
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,840
pretending to be a detective,

342
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,410
always thinking about catching thieves.

343
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,270
You only caught a few

344
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,720
parts thieves in your entire life.

345
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,670
That's not necessary.

346
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,510
You're exposing my shortcomings

347
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,840
in front of the kids.

348
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,110
Can I... can I have this soup?

349
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,790
Sure.

350
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,630
Have it.

351
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,670
I like this kid Li Jian.

352
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,390
He's genuine.

353
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,150
You know?

354
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,240
It feels so good.

355
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,390
Can you remember

356
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,790
the last time we two

357
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,630
ate barbecue skewers by the roadside like this?

358
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,360
When was it?

359
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,130
I can't remember that.

360
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,360
You've eaten so much

361
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,730
in such a short time.

362
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,450
I barely eat at home.

363
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,870
My parents cook too salty.

364
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,050
I've told them for years, but they just can't change.

365
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,360
Dude, that was basically a plate of salt

366
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,510
and you still went to town

367
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,750
on it!

368
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
Was I really eating food?

369
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,080
That was social etiquette.

370
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,000
Social etiquette costs soda.

371
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,790
Yeah, I should have bought mineral water.

372
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,850
The more I drink, the thirstier I get.

373
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,690
You're quite funny, you know.

374
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
You could've just told me

375
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,750
you were having dinner with your parents.

376
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,680
What's with dropping their names?

377
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,140
Li Qingchun sounds quite straightforward.

378
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,960
It doesn't mean "youth”

379
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
from Song of Youth that you’re thinking of.

380
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,550
The “qing” in my mom’s name

381
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,120
is the one with the water radical,

382
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,270
meaning "clear and pure" like fresh spring water.

383
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,840
And the “chun” isn’t the "spring" from the season either.

384
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,080
It’s the character with a wood radical combined with "spring",

385
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
taken from Zhuangzi,

386
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,360
where it refers to a mythical giant tree

387
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,910
symbolizing health and longevity.

388
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,040
That's so cultured.

389
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,960
What did you think?

390
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,790
There's meaning

391
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,390
behind it.

392
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,370
What about your dad's?

393
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,170
Yang Weimin.

394
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,140
What's the meaning behind it?

395
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Serve the people, of course.

396
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,670
You...

397
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,870
Oh my god, I...

398
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,440
You're just messing with me, aren't you?

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,240
Day after day.

400
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,020
Tan Yaoduo.

401
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,510
Hello?

402
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,160
Go ahead.

403
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,510
Division Director Yang,

404
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,040
there's a major discovery.

405
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,410
The car was found near Tianli Manor,

406
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,320
at the entrance of the underground parking lot

407
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
of a nearby shopping mall

408
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
in the surveillance footage.

409
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,510
It's the same car that appeared

410
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,110
in the suspicious area of Tianli Manor before.

411
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,650
It really is her.

412
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,510
So,

413
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,960
at the time when Sander received the information,

414
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,880
the person who appeared

415
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,410
in that suspicious area

416
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,270
of Tianli Manor using a phone

417
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,200
was Zhao Yaning.

418
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,240
Hello?

419
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,400
Alright.

420
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Division Director Yang, it's Director Hua on the phone.

421
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
Hello, Director Hua.

422
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,190
Are the test results out?

423
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,500
These two samples,

424
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,550
due to temperature and humidity factors,

425
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,320
the lab results

426
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,960
may have a slight margin of error.

427
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,360
But we can be certain that

428
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,680
these two extracts come from two different individuals.

429
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,320
Can you determine the gender?

430
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Is there a female?

431
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,120
For that, I still need to

432
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,320
conduct further tests.

433
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,000
You'll have to give me some time.

434
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,460
I'll wait for your update.

435
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,200
Do you think Zhao Yaning

436
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,480
could be Sander Bowie's contact?

437
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,960
Although we don't have direct evidence yet

438
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,130
to prove that Zhao Yaning

439
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,240
has entered Sander Bowie's villa

440
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,200
in Tianli Manor,

441
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,480
but based on

442
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,080
the clues we currently have,

443
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,460
it's highly possible.

444
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,200
First,

445
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,640
on the night we arrested Sander Bowie,

446
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,480
the contact

447
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,200
must have directly seen

448
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
our arrest operation

449
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,480
to be able to

450
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
notify Sander Bowie to evacuate in time.

451
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,170
And at that time,

452
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,100
Zhao Yaning

453
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,830
was inside the Tianli Manor villa area.

454
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,110
Secondly,

455
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,450
by tracing the text messages,

456
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,630
we found the specific location

457
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,290
where the messages were sent,

458
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,000
which was inside Tianli Manor,

459
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,600
within a diameter

460
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,670
of 30 meters,

461
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,240
consistent with

462
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,640
Zhao Yaning's location.

463
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,470
Furthermore,

464
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,080
the moment Sander Bowie

465
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,550
received the text message that night,

466
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,080
we traced the surveillance

467
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,750
and found that at the same moment,

468
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,810
Zhao Yaning was also using her phone.

469
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,320
Zhao Yaning and that contact

470
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,600
match highly in terms of behavior,

471
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,030
logic,

472
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,569
and spatiotemporal

473
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,680
aspects.

474
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,450
Actually, after She Shiyuan's cliff fall case,

475
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,270
I revealed my identity

476
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,349
to Zhao Yaning.

477
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,480
She has been very cooperative with our work.

478
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,200
I had gradually

479
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,130
dismissed my suspicions about her

480
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,280
until this photo appeared.

481
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,920
So I need to conduct

482
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,400
a further in-depth investigation on Zhao Yaning

483
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,260
to determine her true identity as soon as possible.

484
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,480
I just want to ask you one thing.

485
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,750
If Zhao Yaning

486
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,860
is an accomplice of Sander Bowie,

487
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,240
why did she save you

488
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,200
when you were attacked in Jinzhou?

489
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,310
At that time, she didn't know

490
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,440
your real identity.

491
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,520
Of course,

492
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,030
I don't oppose

493
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,930
clarifying her identity as soon as possible.

494
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,000
The Capital City Electric Power Corporation

495
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,130
has completely abandoned

496
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,510
its cooperation with Zhounan Power Plant.

497
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,680
Within Huaze Group,

498
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,580
Xiang Taisheng

499
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,900
has taken over all of Liu Xinnian's work.

500
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,770
Currently,

501
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
the Capital City Electric Power Corporation

502
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
has reconnected with

503
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,930
Huaze Group

504
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,700
and initiated preliminary talks today.

505
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,310
In terms of intelligence and security,

506
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,200
We can't afford any mistakes.

507
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,930
Understood.

508
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,710
So I'd like to request

509
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,440
to use technical measures on Zhao Yaning,

510
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,590
because ordinary methods

511
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,990
are ineffective for her.

512
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,790
The Leader Group is a multinational corporation.

513
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,480
It has partnerships with numerous

514
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,270
Fortune 500 companies.

515
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,160
Moreover,

516
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,830
according to the information I have,

517
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,000
it wants to become

518
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,960

It consists of a fuel kernel and coating layers.

the maximum safety and stability of the nuclear fuel.

Mr. Xiang,

618
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,050
from what I understand,

619
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,890
this is the first time

620
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,560
to cooperate with the outside.

621
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,070
and also your first cooperation

622
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,130
with Capital City.

623
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,460
Yes, that's right.

624
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
I'm not sure if you're aware,

625
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,510
but Leader Group has been deeply involved in the energy industry for many years.

626
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,750
We've had two perfect collaborations

627
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,200
with Capital City

628
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,330
and have maintained an excellent working relationship.

629
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,400
So for this collaboration between Huaze

630
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,080
and Capital City,

631
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,630
whether it's dealing with

632
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,500
issues in collaboration details

633
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,790
or handling government relations,

634
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,080
with Leader's experience,

635
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,930
we can mediate

636
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,620
and ensure the cooperation goes more smoothly.

637
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,110
I see.

638
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,200
More importantly,

639
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,640
I can confidently tell you

640
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,720
that I believe no other PR firm

641
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,960
than we do at Leader

642
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,510

643

After all, we've been following it for months.

644
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,160
Hold on.

645
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,280
The problem is you've been following it for these few months.

646
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,340
That previous espionage case,

647
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,170
you must have seen the news.

648
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,830

with Moss Trading Group...

650

So we need to avoid any suspicion.

651
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,760
It's possible

652
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,420
we'll have to choose a different PR firm.

653
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,640
Mr. Xiang,

654
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,150
we're actually victims too.

655
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,270
In this espionage case,

656
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,720
Leader Group has no connection

657
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
with Moss Trading Group.

658
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,170
On the contrary,

659
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,400
in the process of uncovering their activities,

660
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,680
we provided some assistance

661
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,920
and played a role.

662
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,590
Is that so?

663
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,720
Well, this...

664
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,920
This... I...

665
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,570
It's the first I'm hearing of this.

666

671

It's alright, Mr. Xiang.

673
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,310
I know your time is valuable today,

674
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,770
so I won't go into details.

675
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,800
I just hope

676
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,320
you can give me another chance

677
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,890

678
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,980

679
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,690
Alright.

680

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,500
Let's schedule another meeting in a few days.

688

Is that okay?

Okay.

690

Mr. Xiang, with your words,

691
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I feel reassured.

692
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,160
Have some coffee.

693
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,260
This coffee is good.

694
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,720
Alright.

695
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,640
I'll savor it.

696
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,040
The boss just issued the latest instructions.

697
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,310
For the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor nuclear plant project in collaboration

698
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,920
between Huaze and Capital City,

699
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,850
we must obtain the qualification as a PR contractor.

700
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,800
Is this related to the subsequent grand plan?

701
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,760
This is the latest directive from the higher-ups.

702
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,230
We must join the project.

703
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
Don't ask so many questions.

704
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,410
But Xiang Taisheng now

705
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,300
obviously doesn't trust us much.

706
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
We were too close to Moss Trading Group before,

707
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,200
as well as Liu Xinnian.

708
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,240
He's very concerned about this relationship.

709
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,270
Is there any way

710
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,840
we can do some PR with him?

711
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,110
Given the current situation and circumstances,

712
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,910
I don't recommend a PR approach.

713
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,900
It could easily backfire.

714
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,510
That makes sense.

715
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,840
Actually, deep down,

716
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,720
he's not against

717
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
cooperating with us.

718
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,810
His words are all serious,

719
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,360
but in reality, he just

720
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,180
wants us to find a way to prove

721
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,580
that Leader has nothing to do with the Moss case.

722
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,400
Otherwise,

723
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,750
if any mistakes are made,

724
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,000
his position as the new general manager

725
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,860
will become his former position.

726
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,270
Perhaps

727
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,180
Yang Guang can help us.

728
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,000
For Huaze Group right now,

729
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,300
the ones they trust the most

730
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,450
are those who helped them

731
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,680
solve their big problem,

732
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,030
the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

733
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,350
And in this case,

734
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,900
Yang Guang is the hero.

735
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
So Yang Guang's words

736
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,430
would be convincing

737
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,680
to Xiang Taisheng.

738
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,790
If Yang Guang acts as a mediator

739
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
or helps prove our case,

740
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,330
Mr. Xiang will naturally believe it.

741
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,270
Good idea.

742
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,540
As it happens, tonight

743
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Yang Guang has invited me to dinner.

744
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,010
Ms. Zhao,

745
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,200
Long time no see.

746
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,960
Long time no see.

747
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,550
During this time,

748
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,510
a lot has happened.

749
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,970
But do you know

750
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,510
how I feel when I see you?

751
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,590
What feeling?

752
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,850
I feel like you're about to

753
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,970
tell me

754
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,930
that you have some other identity.

755
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Actually, when I see you,

756
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,210
I have the same feeling.

757
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,110
Really?

758
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,350
Division Director Yang, you're so busy,

759
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,010
how do you have time to meet me?

760
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,680
Last time,

761
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,920
you saved me.

762
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,710
I haven't had the chance to properly thank you.

763
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,740
This meal today

764
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,030
is to thank you.

765
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,420
Come, have a taste.

766
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,510
It's actually quite strange.

767
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,240
They say familiarity breeds closeness,

768
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,110
by that logic,

769
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,310
we should be familiar with each other.

770
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,280
But I always feel

771
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,830
that we're still strangers.

772
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,360
If you say we're strangers,

773
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,510
sometimes it feels quite familiar.

774
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,030
Don't you think it's strange?

775
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,960
What exactly are you trying to say?

776
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,510
You've completely confused me.

777
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,480
Actually, I'm a bit confused myself.

778
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
I just feel that

779
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,490
although I know who you are

780
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,590
and what your job is,

781
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
I actually know nothing about

782
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,350
the specific content of your work

783
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,550
or its significance.

784
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,880
Speaking of work,

785
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,610
I'm very curious

786
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,790
about your job.

787
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,110
Like...

788
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,280
Like what?

789
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,110
For instance, when you arrested Sander,

790
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,440
what was the scene like?

791
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,950
I'm sorry,

792
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,510
but I can't disclose that.

793
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,910
Come on, tell me a little.

794
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,710
Well, it was very thrilling.

795
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,310
How thrilling was it?

796
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,550
Was it like in the movies?

797
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,920
Actually, life

798
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,070
is far more dramatic than what's shown in movies.

799
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,800
When we were arresting Sander,

800
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,840
it was already late at night.

801
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,010
At that time, Sander's ship

802
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,430
had already left the dock

803
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,030
and was speeding towards international waters.

804
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,790
And then?

805
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,600
Then, to prevent his escape,

806
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,720
we dispatched five helicopters,

807
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,780
five fighter jets,

808
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,110
and five bombers.

809
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,440
What happened next?

810
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,500
Later, Sander's ship discovered us,

811
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,000
and the ship's artillery

812
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,730
launched a fierce attack on us.

813
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,440
Our aircraft were almost shot down.

814
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,200
And finally?

815
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,590
Don't look at me like that.

816
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,480
I can't make up any more.

817
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,920
I really can't say. Forgive me.

818
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

819
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,410
Never mind if you can't say.

820
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,680
You said you wanted to thank me properly.

821
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,110
How do you plan to thank me?

822
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,770
You tell me,

823
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,680
anything within my capabilities is fine.

824
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,350
How about treating me to a glass of red wine?

825
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,680
Absolutely no problem.

826
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,750
But...

827
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,510
I'll have to trouble you to take me home.

828
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,170
No problem.

829
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,390
Excuse me,

830
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,900
the wine list, please.

831
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,420
Chauffeur Sonny, service completed.

832
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,640
Please remember to give a five-star rating.

833
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,110
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

834
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,510
Would you mind coming up for a cup of coffee?

835
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,880
I've been quite busy with orders lately.

836
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,270
They're all previous regular customers.

837
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,550
Once I'm done with this busy period...

838
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,920
Isn't the case closed?

839
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,330
That's confidential.

840
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,750
Bye, Sonny.

841
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,480
Bye, Alethea.

842
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,890
How did it go?

843
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,220
It's complicated.

844
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,920
What happened?

845
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
During dinner,

846
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,210
we were talking the whole time,

847
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,750
but thinking back after the meal,

848
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,240
it feels like we didn't really talk about anything.

849
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
We were just there,

850
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,100
going round and round in circles.

851
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,720
Zhao Yaning is no ordinary person.

852
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
She's quite skilled.

853
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,530
Avoiding the topic,

854
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,160
fits the profile of a suspect, doesn't it?

855
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,790
Division Director Yang,

856
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,510
she's home.

857
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,000
The 21st

858
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,640
Shangri-La Dialogue has concluded.

859
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
The Chinese Minister of National Defense

860
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,480
centered on China's global security concept,

861
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,440
delivered the keynote speech at the conference.

862
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,110
Experts say

863
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,770
the Chinese Defense Minister's speech

864
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,700
reflects China's defense policy,

865
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,630
which values peace above all...

866
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,920
Mr. Dong,

867
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,820
this is Yaning.

868
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,710
I'm sorry

869
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,710
for calling you so late.

870
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,800
A while ago,

871
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,360
when I was on a business trip to Lianhai,

872
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,960
the favor I asked you to do for me

873
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,020
is no longer necessary.

874

[Tracking phone]

875

[Profile Information, Dong Wei]

876
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,239
It's showing.

877
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,110
It's a number from Lianhai.

878
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,280
The owner of a trading company.

879
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,409
His name is Dong Wei.

880
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,239
From Lianhai?

881
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,230
The Moss Trading Group is in trouble.

882
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,090
It's quite unexpected, isn't it?

883
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,760
But you had a premonition, didn't you?

884
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,960
It wasn't exactly a premonition.

885
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,840
At that time,

886
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,800
I just felt uneasy.

887
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,320
That's why I asked you

888
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,179
to investigate this branch of the Moss Trading Group.

889
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,320
After all, you've been in Lianhai for so many years.

890
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,719
You have many resources.

891
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,710
Not at all.

892
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,610
You're too kind, Ms. Zhao.

893
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,630
We're friends.

894
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,020
No need to mention it.

895
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,840
Division Director Yang,

896
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,070
Section Chief Ma has sent over the relevant information form

897
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,070
regarding Zhao Yaning’s transfer.

898
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,700
On May 30th,

899
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,230
at 6:13 PM,

900
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,800
Zhao Yaning passed through Yanping North toll station.

901
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,280
At 10:32 PM,

902
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,550
she passed through Lianhai toll station

903
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,670
and entered the urban area.

904
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,130
On the evening of May 30th,

905
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,650
Zhao Yaning made three phone calls in total,

906
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,670
all with Mr. Dong.

907
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,560
The first one was

908
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
at 8:09 PM,

909
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,120
lasting 13 minutes and 12 seconds.

910
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,600
At 11:09 PM,

911
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,400
the second call occurred,

912
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,200
lasting 1 minute and 15 seconds.

913
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,760
At 1:32 AM,

914
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,880
the third call took place,

915
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,810
lasting 16 minutes and 33 seconds.

916
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,070
That night,

917
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,320
did Zhao Yaning's phone

918
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,070
have any record of sending text messages?

919
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,810
There are no text message records.

920
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,160
If she has a second phone

921
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,590
that we don't know about,

922
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,640
who knows what she might have sent?

923
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,590
At the next intersection,

924
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,360
you guys go ahead.

925
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,220
We'll retreat.

926
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,100
Roger that.

927
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,540
Yang Guang's group has completely targeted me.

928
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,200
How did this happen?

929
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,630
Recently,

930
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,510
haven't you been getting closer?

931
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
The reason is still unclear.

932
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,450
I think it's probably because

933
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,320
when I went to Lianhai to meet Luca,

934
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,510
they noticed me.

935
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,760
They've already put my house under surveillance.

936
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,280
Your appearance in Lianhai

937
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,360
should have a reasonable explanation, right?

938
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,030
According to our plan at the time,

939
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,290
we used Mr. Dong of Xuhui Group as a cover.

940
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,140
I have a good personal relationship with him, so it's not a problem.

941
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,440
We must clear your suspicion as soon as possible.

942
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,840
The second phase of the plan

943
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
is about to begin.

944
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,960
I need you.

945
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,990
I understand.

946
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,070
Is there anything you need me to do?

947
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,470
I'll cooperate with you.

948
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,740
You guys haven't eaten yet?

949
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,400
Good job.

950
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,920
How's it going?

951
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,110
Have you found anything?

952
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,000
Nothing.

953
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,670
Listening to music,

954
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,320
watching movies,

955
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,800
doing yoga.

956
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,400
Does this count as a finding?

957
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,150
There's not even a single unusual situation?

958
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,350
Really nothing, bro.

959
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,670
She's just in a very good mood,

960
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,710
very relaxed.

961
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,530
I even doubt if we're following the wrong person.

962
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,180
How's the investigation going in Lianhai?

963
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,670
She just met with people from Xuhui Group

964
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,630
twice.

965
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,690
Basically just the hotel,

966
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,090
the company,

967
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,150
back and forth between these two points.

968
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,880
Nothing unusual found either.

969
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,280
J,

970
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,150
I got it.

971
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,280
I'll head back right away.

972
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,710
About 20 minutes.

973
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,800
See you soon.

974
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,190
There must be an emergency at the company.

975
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,720
As usual,

976
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,650
two cars take turns following.

977
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,900
Where are you?

978
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,400
The target is about to get in the car.

979
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,030
Hurry up.

980
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,670
Division Director Yang.

981
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,280
We're going straight at this intersection.

982
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,410
You keep following.

983
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,140
Roger that.

984
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,000
Hello, Director Hua.

985
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,530
Go ahead.

986
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,840
Division Director Yang,

987
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,800
the test results show

988
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,510
those two samples you brought last time,

989
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,630
the capillary fibers

990
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,690
and mixed extracts

991
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,020
are all from males.

992
00:42:59,370 --> 00:42:59,900
Yes, sir.

993
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,760
I got it.

994
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,430
Thank you for your hard work.
