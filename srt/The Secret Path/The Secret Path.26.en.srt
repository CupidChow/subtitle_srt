1
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,560
I'll listen to the recording from this afternoon.

2
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,020
There was nothing last night.

3
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,840
We watched all night for nothing.

4
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
They're more anxious than us now.

5
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,240
They'll definitely make a move.

6
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,840
So don't let your guard down.

7
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,410
Division Director Yang, look.

8
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,590
You keep an eye on James here.

9
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,990
I'll follow Zhao Yaning.

10
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,800
Mr. Xiang, this is Yaning.

11
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,080
I know.

12
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,310
There are some details about

13
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,310
tomorrow's visit

14
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,570
that I want to discuss with you in person.

15
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,350
Is it convenient for you now?

16
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,110
Sure.

17
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,680
I'll go to Xinghai Hotel to meet you.

18
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm already at the checkpoint of Pengze Hotel.

19
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,520
How about we talk at Pengze Hotel?

20
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,520
That works.

21
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,630
Give me your license plate number.

22
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,690
I'll have the guard

23
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
let you in.

24
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,340
Alright, see you soon.

25
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
Hello, Director Liu.

26
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,790
Zhao Yaning showed up

27
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,870
at Pengze Hotel early this morning.

28
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,190
I don't know what she's up to.

29
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,450
I'm following her now.

30
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Could you arrange for me

31
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,560
to get into the surveillance room?

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,470
No problem. I'll contact them right away.

33
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,400
Okay, thank you.

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,650
Ms. Zhao.

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Xiang.

36
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,290
Please, have a seat.

37
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,190
What's so urgent

38
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,959
that you came here in person?

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,430
Last night, when I was going over

40
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,950
the tour process with James,

41
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,950
I found some details still unclear.

42
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,830
After all, our nuclear power plant

43
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,390
is a sensitive and important facility.

44
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,430
We're worried that during tomorrow's visit,

45
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,950
we might accidentally offend you in some way.

46
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,210
So I came to clarify the details with you.

47
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,630
Details?

48
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,630
What details? Go ahead.

49
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,430
For such confidential matters,

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,370
should we talk about them somewhere else?

51
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,750
Let's go to the conference room.

52
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,270
Alright.

53
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,830
Please, follow me.

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,360
Okay.

55
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
This way, please.

56
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,480
Mr. Xiang, I hope that my sudden visit

57
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,950
isn't disturbing your work.

58
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,430
No,

59
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,270
not at all.

60
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,270
My main job right now

61
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,480
is to complete the cooperation with Taiyu Group.

62
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,240
I hope you

63
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,750
can help me out.

64
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,350
You're being too modest.

65
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,510
Our Huaze Group's technology

66
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,600
is one-of-a-kind.

67
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Taiyu Group has no other choice,

68
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
unless they don't want

69
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,550
this fourth-generation nuclear technology.

70
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,680
I hope so.

71
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,000
Please.

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,160
Is there surveillance in the conference room?

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,680
No.

74
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,210
Please replay footage

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,930
from camera two,

76
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,600
starting from when this woman entered the lobby.

77
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,870
Camera three.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
Zoom in on this woman's face.

79
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,870
Play at 0.2 speed.

80
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,610
Camera six.

81
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,310
From when they got off the elevator.

82
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,710
Still zoom in on her face.

83
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,950
Play at 0.2 speed.

84
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,750
Mr. Xiang, I was wondering

85
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,310
if we could visit the core of

86
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,680
the nuclear power plant tomorrow

87
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,510
to see the actual operations.

88
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,440
That's not possible.

89
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,750
The core area of the nuclear power plant is off-limits.

90
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Not even to partners?

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,360
No.

92
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,440
We have strict confidentiality rules.

93
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,830
How about this,

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,830
could I meet with

95
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,190
Mr. Ou personally?

96
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,580
That's also...

97
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,270
not very convenient.

98
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,510
Look, you're visiting tomorrow,

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
so meeting him

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,680
separately in advance today

101
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,750
doesn't seem to serve much purpose.

102
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,830
Don't you think?

103
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,670
I understand.

104
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,570
Thanks for understanding.

105
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,310
My boss is calling.

106
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Please, go ahead.

107
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,070
Okay.

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,510
Boss.

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Yes.

110
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,510
Zoom in on her face.

111
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,350
I'm sorry, no entry allowed.

112
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,360
I'm Mr. Xiang's friend.

113
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
This area is off-limits.

114
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,200
Zhao,

115
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,010
is the task completed?

116
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,910
Halfway there. I only made it to the third floor.

117
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,870
I couldn't find an excuse to go to the fourth floor.

118
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,320
That's not like you.

119
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,120
I tried to ask for a meeting with Mr. Ou,

120
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,650
but Xiang Taisheng directly refused me.

121
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,150
J, I think I'm being watched.

122
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,670
Stay calm. It's normal.

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,440
You going to Pengze

124
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,670
definitely drew their attention.

125
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,750
Go back to the hotel now.

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Let's meet at the dining hall.

127
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,750
Okay.

128
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,720
Hello.

129
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,600
How many in your party?

130
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,360
Two. Thank you.

131
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
This way, please.

132
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,270
Two business sets, please. Thank you.

133
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,400
Sure, just a moment.

134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,460
How's it going?

135
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,840
The security at Pengze Hotel is very tight.

136
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,630
So far,

137
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,390
I haven't found a way in yet.

138
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,360
After my visit today,

139
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,020
they'll definitely beef up security even more.

140
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,210
Now even the State Security is on to us.

141
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,270
I'm worried that

142
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,670
tomorrow's operation will be very difficult.

143
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,200
Zhao,

144
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,090
it doesn't matter.

145
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
No matter how powerful they are,

146
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,840
they can't stop the Peace Dove from flying.

147
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,390
Our plan will definitely succeed.

148
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,230
So, what exactly are we going

149
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,590
to do at Pengze Hotel?

150
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,480
The time hasn't come yet.

151
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,030
You'll know tomorrow.

152
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,240
Good work today.

153
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
After dinner, go back and get some rest.

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,400
I've already had it checked by experts.

155
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,390
Her eye movement

156
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,470
is a clear sign of taking photos.

157
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,560
She must be wearing spy contact lenses.

158
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,120
What was she up to then?

159
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,080
Currently staying at Pengze Hotel are

160
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,010
Mr. Xiang from Huaze Group and the negotiation team,

161
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,670
as well as

162
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,030
the expert on HTGR technologies,

163
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,720
Mr. Ou, and his team.

164
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
After the project team checked in,

165
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,240
the hotel stopped taking outside guests.

166
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,390
Zhao Yaning's actions today

167
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,440
are definitely not normal.

168
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,450
Could she be casing the place?

169
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
Play that recording.

170
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,730
How's it going?

171
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,120
The security at Pengze Hotel is very tight.

172
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,440
So far,

173
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,080
I haven't found a way in yet.

174
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,600
After my visit today,

175
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,320
they'll definitely beef up security even more.

176
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,450
Now even the State Security is on to us.

177
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,510
I'm worried that

178
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,030
tomorrow's operation will be very difficult.

179
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,600
Zhao,

180
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,450
it doesn't matter.

181
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,200
No matter how powerful they are,

182
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,360
they can't stop the Peace Dove from flying.

183
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,790
Our plan will definitely succeed.

184
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,630
So, what exactly are we going

185
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,870
to do at Pengze Hotel?

186
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,840
The time hasn't come yet.

187
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,380
You'll know tomorrow.

188
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,750
Good work today.

189
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,710
After dinner, go back and get some rest.

190
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,080
Based on the clues we have now,

191
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,360
I deduce that

192
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,250
the target of this enemy operation

193
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,750
is likely Pengze Hotel.

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,090
More specifically,

195
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,150
Mr. Ou staying here.

196
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,870
Since Mr. Sun's passing,

197
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,510
Mr. Ou has been the main person in charge of the project.

198
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,040
If anything happens to him,

199
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,610
the subsequent technological R&D will be interrupted.

200
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,120
That would be a huge blow

201
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,790
to China's nuclear energy field.

202
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,790
These guys are really vicious.

203
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,910
They can't develop it themselves,

204
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,200
so they're trying to block our way.

205
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,720
Given the current situation,

206
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
we must report to Director Zhang immediately.

207
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,920
Let's all think about

208
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,280
what means the enemy might use.

209
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,630
Excuse me,

210
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,870
I need to interrupt you for a moment.

211
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,270
Could you introduce your

212
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,600
guest rooms to me?

213
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,630
Mr. Xiang,

214
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,790
we're from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

215
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,960
For your safety,

216
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,480
please cooperate with us.

217
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Understood.

218
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,360
How should I cooperate?

219
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
This way, please.

220
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
Change the water.

221
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Go.

222
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,750
This guy's got some nerve.

223
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,750
The operation is tomorrow,

224
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,630
yet he's still watching variety shows.

225
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,670
He hasn't missed a single show these days.

226
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,510
It seems like

227
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,480
he's absolutely confident.

228
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,069
Check again.

229
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,599
Alright.

230
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,349
Director Liu.

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,349
Division Director Yang.

232
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,200
Section Chief Li.

233
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,349
You're finally here.

234
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,440
Help me analyze this quickly.

235
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,160
See if I've missed anything.

236
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,790
I've checked everything inside and out three times.

237
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,349
Haven't found any problems.

238
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,109
You need to relax.

239
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,510
Don't be overly nervous.

240
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,590
Tomorrow at 10 AM,

241
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,510
the nuclear power technology will be presented.

242
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,110
There are only about 10 hours left.

243
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,350
How can I not be nervous?

244
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,510
Have you checked all the newly hired personnel?

245
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,840
All service personnel,

246
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,640
cleaners, guest room service,

247
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,270
reception, logistics, and kitchen staff

248
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,670
have been investigated.

249
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,550
The most recent hire is a cleaner,

250
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,070
who was employed half a year ago

251
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,870
and has already been dismissed.

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,110
Has the water source been checked?

253
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,750
Tap water samples have been taken and sent for testing.

254
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,640
We'll have

255
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,390
the lab results in two hours.

256
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
All bottled drinking water has been replaced.

257
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,480
What about the food?

258
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,240
It's impossible to check every ingredient,

259
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,900
but I've replaced everything

260
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
with food supplied by the internal

261
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,270
food supplier of Lianhai City

262
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,070
National Security Bureau.

263
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,510
Any abnormalities in the security system?

264
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,830
All the hotel's surveillance systems

265
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
have been taken over by us.

266
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,680
Technical experts have checked them,

267
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,750
and there are no viruses.

268
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,030
All security personnel have been

269
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,560
replaced by our own people.

270
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Wang Xiaoquan from the Shiji Hotel,

271
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,270
his daughter had a heart disease.

272
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,200
Do you remember?

273
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,510
Director Liu, please check immediately

274
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,030
the family situations of all hotel service personnel.

275
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,790
See if there are any families in urgent need of money.

276
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,590
I really overlooked this point.

277
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,790
All teams, attention.

278
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,830
Immediately investigate

279
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,030
the family situations of all relevant hotel staff.

280
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,960
Check if there are families with sudden serious illnesses

281
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,420
that urgently need money.

282
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,200
Indeed, several service staffs

283
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,730
have family members with serious illnesses,

284
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
but according to the information we have,

285
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
after medical insurance reimbursement,

286
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,720
they are fully capable of covering these expenses.

287
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,160
We have also conducted in-depth

288
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,560
have conducted a thorough investigation.

289
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,240
and found no abnormalities.

290
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,030
Could they have some

291
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,830
means that we're unaware of?

292
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,720
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

293
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,590
We don't even know

294
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,160
how to guard against it.

295
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,360
This puts us in a very passive position.

296
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,340
Is there any new progress

297
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,610
in the search for Luca?

298
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,830
Some of the equipment

299
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,400
needed for their operation this time

300
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
is still in Luca's possession.

301
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,000
If we can find him,

302
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,970
we can also stop their plan.

303
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,010
There's no progress at all.

304
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,550
We have less than 10 hours left.

305
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,550
We have less than 10 hours.

306
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,030
Director Liu, please keep an eye on this place with Li Jian.

307
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,400
I'll go back to watch James and Zhao Yaning.

308
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,130
Don't worry.

309
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,170
Be careful.

310
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,640
Can you be more careful?

311
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,350
Director Liu.

312
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Hello?

313
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,070
Are you there?

314
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Yes.

315
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,550
Are you busy?

316
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,510
No, I was just about to go to bed.

317
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,880
How are you?

318
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,210
Is the project going smoothly?

319
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,520
It's going well.

320
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,890
After tomorrow's visit to the nuclear power plant,

321
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,440
if everything goes well,

322
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,500
we can officially sign the contract.

323
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,440
It'll be basically done.

324
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,170
Congratulations.

325
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,310
Then when you get back to Yanping,

326
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,640
I'll treat you to a meal.

327
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,280
We haven't...

328
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,730
seen each other for a long time.

329
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,590
Yes,

330
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
it's been a long time.

331
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,270
So,

332
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,750
on this special day,

333
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,450
I thought of you

334
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,120
and decided to call you.

335
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,110
Nothing else.

336
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,270
I see.

337
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,730
I'll wait for you to come back.

338
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,720
If...

339
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,640
I can come back.

340
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,970
What do you mean by that?

341
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,610
I don't understand.

342
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,160
I might have to continue my business trip.

343
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,930
Even if you're on a business trip,

344
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,460
won't you eventually return to Yanping?

345
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,880
Good night, Sonny.

346
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,730
Good night.

347
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,620
All the best for tomorrow.

348
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,640
Honey,

349
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,110
wait for me.

350
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,400
I'll be back soon.

351
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,840
I'll be waiting for you.

352
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,030
This is food from our Chinese Ministry of State Security.

353
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,490
Please feel free to eat it.

354
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,350
Hello.

355
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,440
Alright.

356
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,880
Bye.

357
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,960
Mr. Yao,

358
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,110
today's visit

359
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,240
doesn't cover the core area.

360
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,550
But I think

361
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,790
only the core area

362
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,070
can truly reflect

363
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,550
the actual operations.

364
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,440
James, you should have brought it up earlier.

365
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,420
If I had, I'd have been directly refused,

366
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,750
leaving no room for negotiation.

367
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,110
I think the best time to raise

368
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,030
this issue is after the basic tour,

369
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,270
when we're about to

370
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,000
discuss cooperation.

371
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,640
I'll tell Manager Li.

372
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,130
With the cooperation almost sealed,

373
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,680
Huaze is unlikely to refuse.

374
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,000
Don't worry.

375
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,830
I'll push for this

376
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
I'll make sure Manager Li

377
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,350
sees the real situation.

378
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,590
Thank you so much.

379
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,750
I hope everything goes smoothly.

380
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,440
My friend James.

381
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,940
It certainly will.

382
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,970
How's it going?

383
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,840
Just about to get in the car.

384
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,410
Let's go.

385
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,150
Shouldn't we try to relax a bit?

386
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,630
Look, Director Liu is personally escorting him,

387
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,960
and the police will cooperate all the way.

388
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,360
Luca still hasn't been caught,

389
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,110
and we're not sure

390
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,350
what James's plan is.

391
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,540
I'm always on edge.

392
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,230
Yes.

393
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,070
Mr. Ou's personal safety

394
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,270
won't be threatened.

395
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,800
We're keeping an eye on things here,

396
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,070
and the security at the nuclear power plant

397
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,590
is even stricter, right?

398
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,639
Let's hope so.

399
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,840
I hope so.

400
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,710
Luca Mori.

401
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,280
Luca Mori!

402
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,360
Luca Mori.

403
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Long time no see.

404
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,920
Your hair has grown.

405
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,440
Come on up.

406
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,890
I got a bunch of stuff I need to give you.

407
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,110
My US passport and money first.

408
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,230
Oh, business before pleasure, huh?

409
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,670
Alright.

410
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,920
This is your US passport.

411
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,320
You'll get the rest of your money

412
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,580
after you leave Chine.

413
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,620
Please tell me,

414
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,800
what is the mission?

415
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,510
The mission is to cooperate with James.

416
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,320
You go to the checkpoint.

417
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,110
You'll activate the machinery

418
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,920
and you'll wait for the nuclear power plant to begin its terminal operation.

419
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,760
What that's gonna do, it'll generate copious amounts of quantitative data.

420
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,360
Your mission is to retrieve that data.

421
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,920
Now, the equipment that you brought with you

422
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,510
that's specially designed for remote data retrieval.

423
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,190
Once the data has been collected,

424
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,430
you're going to bring that back here to the dark to me.

425
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,150
You won't need to have any interactions with anyone else along the way.

426
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,320
Easy peasy, right?

427
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Easy?

428
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,590
For that place?

429
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,090
What do you exactly mean by the word easy?

430
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,630
Just mean that it'll be easy for you.

431
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,030
The coordinates have already been entered into the GPS.

432
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,760
Stick to this route should be fine.

433
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,480
Are the borders around the nuclear power plant

434
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
protected?

435
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,510
Yeah, of course. Relax. I've checked it out.

436
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,760
Nuclear power plant, the surrounding waterway are totally unprotected.

437
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,110
All you need to do is you dive right into the water, swim over to the other side.

438
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,040
Once you get to the opposite shore,

439
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,930
you're gonna find a bunker,

440
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,450
gonna set up your equipment and then you can begin remote data retrieval.

441
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,920
What is that thing then?

442
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,850
Looks like a weapon or something?

443
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,230
You're gonna like this.

444
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,230
You'll know what to do with it when the time comes.

445
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,210
When you're ready, J will give you the passcode.

446
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,170
But you're not ready just yet.

447
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,590
Okay, Luca.

448
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,630
It's time.

449
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,800
Goodbye.

450
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,320
And good luck.

451
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,190
Okay, Luca.

452
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,590
Godspeed

453
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,670
and good luck.

454
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,350
I'm going out for some fresh air.

455
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,360
Copy data.

456
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,360
Do you remember

457
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,510
the assassination that happened at the Shiji Hotel?

458
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,970
I remember. What about it?

459
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,070
What if this time

460
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,150
they're also creating a diversion?

461
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,190
Back then, we focused all our attention

462
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,110
on

463
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,630
the meeting-related facilities and environment,

464
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,190
completely ignoring Wang Xiaoquan.

465
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,960
This time,

466
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,840
targeting Mr. Ou

467
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,110
could indeed delay

468
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,110
or even hinder

469
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,370
our future technological R&D progress.

470
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,510
But other than that,

471
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,190
they wouldn't gain much more benefit.

472
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,230
However, the HTGR technologies

473
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,440
are something only we possess

474
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,240
and one-of-a-kind in the world.

475
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,400
So,

476
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,150
Pengze Hotel is just a smokescreen.

477
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,800
Their real target is

478
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,700
the Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant.

479
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,150
Hello?

480
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,160
Director Liu.

481
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,320
You're absolutely right.

482
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,960
I'll contact the nuclear power plant immediately

483
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,360
to strengthen security.

484
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,190
Also,

485
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,760
since you know the opponents best,

486
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,560
you should head to the nuclear power plant as well.

487
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,800
Hello?

488
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,550
Hello.

489
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,190
Is this Division Director Yang?

490
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm the head of security at Lianhai Nuclear Power Plant.

491
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
My surname is Ren.

492
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Hello, Director Ren.

493
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,670
I'm Yang Guang.

494
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,630
The general situation has been

495
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,670
explained to me by Director Liu from Lianhai Bureau.

496
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,440
The visiting group hasn't arrived yet.

497
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,770
What do you need me to do?

498
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,260
Don't make any rash moves for now.

499
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,450
We strongly suspect

500
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,920
that the representative from Leader Group in the visiting group

501
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,110
has some ulterior motives regarding the nuclear power plant.

502
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,910
However, we haven't figured out

503
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,280
the specific methods and means yet.

504
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,010
Understood.

505
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,840
I'll strengthen the security measures at the nuclear power plant

506
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,800
and be extra vigilant.

507
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Could you find a way to

508
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,230
slow down their progress through security checks?

509
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,230
We need about

510
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,280
25 more minutes to get there.

511
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,030
No problem.

512
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,190
The visiting group will enter through the south gate,

513
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,320
which is the main entrance.

514
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,840
You go through the north gate.

515
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,960
I'll have someone meet you there.

516
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,760
I'll send you the location shortly.

517
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,030
Great, thank you so much.
