(Don't think you'll have it easy)

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,760
Hi.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,760
Can I help you?

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
I came specifically to tell you

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,760
some good news.

16
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,832
(Engagement Banquet,
Ji Chengxuan and Shen Yueran)

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,320
Engagement.

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,520
Why don't you two just get married?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,960
Xia Tian,

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,400
looks like you are just jealous.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
So are you coming or not?

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
Shen Yueran, are we familiar?

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
You're here to invite me

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,600
because you want
my gift money that badly?

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,800
Are you scared?

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
Yeah.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,800
You're a mere bumpkin.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,280
How could you possibly have the nerve
to come to my engagement party?

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,240
Yes, I'm afraid.

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm afraid that I'll steal your thunder.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,480
I'll be waiting for you.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,000
Whether you bless or curse us,

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,320
you can't change anything.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,520
I've had enough.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,240
Shen Yue...

36
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
Hello, your delivery.
You're Xia Tian, right?

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Chengxuan.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
What took you so long?

39
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,120
I

40
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,080
went to invite the important guest
to our engagement party.

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,040
Okay, I know you have your reasons.

42
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,840
The engagement is set for tomorrow.

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
It might be a bit rushed time-wise,

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,440
but I did my best.

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Chengxuan,

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
it's so good to have you around.

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,440
Order something.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
You didn't order?

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,760
Nope, I've been waiting for you.

50
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,040
Waiter.

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,440
Waiter.

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,400
I'm just too pretty.

53
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,440
Xia Tian,

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,240
you're just a little bug.

55
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,640
Miss Shen,

56
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,600
Mr. Ji Chengxuan

57
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,880
was engaged with Miss He Shanyue

58
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
who's your cousin.

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,920
May I ask what happened

60
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
between you?

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,320
That was our grandpa making a mismatch.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,680
Chengxuan and I are meant to be.

63
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,480
And only if I marry Chengxuan,

64
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,520
can the group...

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Why is she here?

66
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,360
Yeah.

67
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,160
What is she doing here?

68
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,080
Ji Chengxuan.

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,080
What's it?

70
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,840
Ji Chengxuan,

71
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,440
you hired me to pretend to be He Shanyue

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,480
to help you seize
the He family's fortune.

73
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
Now you've realized

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,320
that marrying Shen Yueran
can help you get the fortune faster.

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,840
You're really marrying for money!

76
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,120
Xia Tian, what are you doing here?

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,920
I don't know. I just heard about it.

78
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
I forgot to introduce myself.

79
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
My name is Xia Tian.

80
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm an unknown actor.

81
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,960
This one is my former employer.

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,040
And the other is my former sworn cousin.

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
So you know,

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,400
how could I not come

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,760
on their big day?

86
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,360
So that's how it is.

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Xia Tian,

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,520
stop it.

89
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Ji Chengxuan,

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
you said you would marry me,

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480
but you abandoned me

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,000
and even pushed me
to the ground in my dream.

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,920
You're just a heartless man!

94
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,120
Miss He,

95
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
may I ask
if everything you just said is true?

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,480
Has Mr. Ji Chengxuan really done that?

97
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,200
Yes.

98
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,520
He had me impersonate He Shanyue

99
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,600
and toyed with me.

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,680
He is a hypocrite clothed
as a gentleman.

101
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,000
This bumpkin really pissed me off!

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
She ruined my plans.

103
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
That was the guest

104
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,080
you invited.

105
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,640
I asked her to come over and see

106
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,800
how perfect we are together.

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
What's wrong with that?

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
Now our scandal
is all over the Internet.

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Are you happy now?

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
It's all because of you

111
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,200
being obsessed with that bumpkin.

112
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
That's why I did it.

113
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
Shen Yueran,

114
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,000
are you using me as your punching bag?

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,280
Chengxuan.

116
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,280
Chengxuan.

117
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,960
Chengxuan, I was wrong.

118
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
I was wrong.

119
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,480
I heard that the stock price fell,

120
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
so I was too anxious.

121
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Who cares about the scandals?

122
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,240
When I sell the company,

123
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,680
we can take the money and go abroad

124
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,600
to live a carefree and comfortable life.
How about that?

125
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,880
The stock price has been halved
and you still want to sell it?

126
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
Tomorrow is the acquisition meeting.

127
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm going to sell it no matter what.

128
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,640
What does it matter
if we lose some money?

129
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
That money

130
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,280
is enough for us
to live a carefree life together.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Hold me.

132
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,040
