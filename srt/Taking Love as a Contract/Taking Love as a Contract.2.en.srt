Xia Tian?

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
Please be professional.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm just trying to steal
the spotlight for you, okay?

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,720
Getting nervous
on such a small occasion?

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,720
Don't worry. It is okay
even if you don't catch me.

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
Chengxuan,

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,240
it's really lucky to have you.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,440
Otherwise, I'd have made
a fool of myself.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,440
Grandpa.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
as you all know,

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,080
I've been in bad health recently.

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,160
I never thought

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,200
at this last moment,

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,640
I would find my beloved granddaughter.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Shan,

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I fear I may not have much time left.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,080
You can start planning your marriage.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
(Marriage?)

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,320
I witness Chengxuan growing up.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,880
I admire his character and abilities.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
I will

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,720
entrust you to him.

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,600
Your marriage was arranged
when you were little.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,920
Have you forgotten?

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,720
Grandpa,

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
she's just too surprised.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
Alright.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,400
I have already selected
an auspicious day.

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,000
Next month,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,080
still here,

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,200
their engagement ceremony will be held.

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Don't you think
you need to explain something?

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
What's there to explain?

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,960
Weren't we childhood friends?

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Why are we going to get engaged now?

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,200
Wouldn't marrying me

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
benefit you?

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,360
Don't be so close to me.

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,920
And I'm warning you not to do it again.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,280
It's really gross.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,520
Xia Tian.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,880
You mistook someone.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,360
Then why did you turn around?

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Take it easy.

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,040
Considering our many years

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,200
of friendship,

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
I will keep it a secret for you.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,800
But you're a rich lady now.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Giving your husband some pocket money
isn't too much to ask, right?

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
What husband?

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Get away from me.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
Drop the act.

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
We've been in the same bed
hundreds of times.

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
Zou Bo.

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,200
Who was in the same bed with you?

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,960
This is it.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,880
You get agitated as soon as you hear it.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
This way, you'll be caught.

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,800
It's hard to believe you're an actress.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Listen.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Don't throw dirt on me.

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,760
What dirt?

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,720
You probably don't know

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
about AI synthesis, right?

77
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,400
What are you going to do?

78
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
Just tear it up.

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,080
I've got plenty.

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,160
These photos must be
worth 1 million yuan, right?

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,760
Zou Bo, do you realize
you're committing a crime?

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,520
I can call the police right now.

83
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,840
Do it.

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,440
If you don't mind me sharing your photos

85
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
with everyone

86
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,680
before the police get here.

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
You know

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
that it's less fun alone

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,760
than the joy of the crowd.

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Mr. Ji.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,640
I'm very interested in
the photos of my fiancee.

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
Why not sell them to me?

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,360
Sure.

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Just these manipulated photos?

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
Mr. Ji,

96
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
the photos are fake,

97
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
but the secret is real.

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,480
She's not He Shanyue.

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,360
She's just an unknown actress.

100
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,320
To tell you the truth,

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,080
I still have her contract
for auditioning for He Shanyue.

102
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
How about this?

103
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll give you 100,000 yuan

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
to trade for the contract.

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,720
You're the one
who recommended me to him?

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,720
Jian Ze.

107
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Mr. Ji.

108
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,360
Mr. Jian?

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,280
So, you're his boss.

110
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
What are you doing?

111
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,760
What for? I'll call the police.

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
What's this?

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,760
For your threat,

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,280
I will help you solve it.

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,440
It seems like your threat, Ji Chengxuan.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
You look like a decent man,

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,520
but you did business
with a bad guy like Zou Bo!

118
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,120
Just do your job.

119
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,120
You love how you've fooled

120
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
everyone around, right?

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,720
When did actors suddenly start

122
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680
expecting high moral standards?

123
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,720
Miss Xia,

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
this is your job,

125
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
but you are being so pretentious now.

126
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,920
You just want to raise
the price, don't you?

127
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,960
Name your price.

128
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,640
Act on your own.

129
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Mr. Ji,

130
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
what if she is unwilling to cooperate?

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Keep an eye on her.

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes.

133
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,600
Grandma, have you been eating well?

134
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
Xia Tian, how come you
have time to come back?

135
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,640
Didn't you say the other day

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,320
that you took on a big project?

137
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,960
The financier of my project

138
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,400
is arrogant, greedy and lecherous,

139
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,440
so I turned down that project.

140
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
It's right to turn it down.

141
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
People like that

142
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,920
can't be worked with.

143
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
How do you feel?

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,280
I want to go back

145
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,600
to see the flowers on my balcony.

146
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,920
I can take care of our home.

147
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Am I not the little apprentice
you personally raised?

148
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,760
Are you afraid
that I might kill those flowers?

149
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,240
A call.

150
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Hello.

151
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,960
Is this Xia Tian?

152
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,120
Yes.

153
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm notifying you

154
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,800
that your property located at
No. 18 Dongyu Road

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,460
will officially enter
the foreclosure process

156
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,120
due to the failure to pay the late fee.

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,600
Hello?

158
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Come on. Why are you hitting?

159
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,960
Zou Bo,

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
come out with me.

161
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,160
Who is this?

162
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,480
Isn't this Miss He?

163
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,960
You don't repay the money you mortgaged

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
or pay the late fee.

165
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,080
What on earth do you want to do?

166
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,880
Now you see it.

167
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't have money at all.

168
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,120
Do whatever you like.

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
You really are a bad guy.

170
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
You swindled my grandma's house,

171
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
then blackmailed and slandered me.

172
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,880
I must have been blind to fall for you.

173
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,640
I am a bad guy,

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,760
but Ji Chengxuan
is a good person, right?

175
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
Have you slept with him?

176
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Get off.

177
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,280
Let go of me.

178
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
You've been with me for so long,

179
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,520
and you wouldn't let me
touch you at all.

180
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,520
Fine.

181
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,320
Today I will experience

182

183

Help!

184
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920

Behave.

186
