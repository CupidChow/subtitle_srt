(So many people.)

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,960
(Where do I find him?)

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,600
(Ji Chengxuan.)

(Isn't this)

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,440
(Ji Chengxuan?)

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,040
Should I take it for you?

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,360
No, thanks.

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
You should lose weight.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,720
(Fine, just focus on the task.)

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,440
You must be the famous Mr. Ji.

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
You are...?

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
He Shanyue.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,440
May I buy you a drink?

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
How about a dance instead?

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Sure.

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,440
Your name sounds very familiar.

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,280
What's your relationship with Mr. He

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,360
of the Jiuzhou Group?

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
You mean my grandfather?

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,720
Grandfather?

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,360
I never heard he had
such a beautiful granddaughter.

34
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,880
I got lost in an amusement park
when I was six.

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,640
Is there a problem?

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
But how come I heard

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
that you were stolen?

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Mr. Ji,

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,440
why do you always talk about
unimportant things?

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Isn't it good to focus on
the current moment?

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,960
You are approaching me on purpose.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,120
If you give me this tie,

43
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,320
I will tell you slowly.

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
You just said

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,360
your name is...

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,560
He Shanyue.

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,080
For Miss He,

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,560
you still lack the temperament.

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
What do you mean?

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
Why do you pretend to be someone else?

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
Is it because you are feeling inferior?

52
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
You are not He Shanyue.

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,600
You should improve your acting skill.

55
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
It's awful.

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
Mr. Ji.

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Mr. Ji.

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Mr. Ji.

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,400
Actually, I am an actress.

60
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,120
I've got an audition.

61
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
As long as I can get your tie,

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
I could get 10,000 yuan.

63
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,440
Could you please give me the tie?

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,720
Once I get the money,
I can give you 2,000 yuan

65
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
or half of the money.

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Mr. Ji,

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,120
I really need the money.

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Can you help me, please?

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
Does this have anything to do with me?

70
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
Please be more serious
and don't take selfies

71
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
during work in the future.

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,720
I...

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
(You are not He Shanyue.)

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,960
(Why do you pretend to be someone else?)

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,920
(Is it because
you are feeling inferior?)

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,120
(He's right. I am not He Shanyue.)

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,080
(I'm just an unknown actress.)

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,640
(A fake heiress who spares no effort)

79
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,440
(for 10,000 yuan.)

80
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,320
Xia Tian.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,280
I'll give you 5 million yuan.
Leave my son.

82
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,680
Auntie,

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
do you know
that prices are skyrocketing now?

84
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,560
This money can't even buy me a house
within the Third Ring Road.

85
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,480
Okay, cut.

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,160
Xia Tian,

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,440
you have to pay the medical bills today.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
No more time for you.

89
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,840
I just landed a job.

90
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,960
I'll pay it soon.

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,320
You promise.

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,800
Xia Tian,

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,680
I don't like the smell of the hospital.

94
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,480
I'm not used to staying here.

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
Let me go home.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
Just stay here

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
and listen to the doctor.

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
Is it expensive?

99
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,280
No.

100
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
I can make money.

101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Mr. Zou,

102
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,440
the mortgage of this house
is already due.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
If you don't pay the late fee
by next month,

104
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,200
we'll have to start
the foreclosure process, okay?

105
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,520
Take care, sir.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,440
What are you doing, Zou Bo?

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,840
You mortgaged my grandma's house?

108
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,320
What's wrong?

109
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,480
The house is vacant anyway.

110
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm just trying to pay
Grandma's medical bills, right?

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,680
Are you crazy?

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,240
Pay back the money!

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
(I need money for Grandma's treatment)

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,280
(and redeeming the old house.)

115
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,360
(And the paycheck I was about to get
slipped through my fingers.)

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,840
Miss Xia,

117
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,040
congratulations,
you barely passed the interview.

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,200
This is the previously agreed wage.

119
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
For a more detailed personal profile,

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,560
my assistant Jian Ze will tell you.

121
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,200
You did that on purpose just now.

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,400
Now you need to familiarize

123
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,440
yourself with everything
about He Shanyue.

124
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,000
Her family background,

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
her manners,

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,000
her taste and preferences.

127
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
I get it.

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
Hold the umbrella.

129
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
(After tonight,)

130
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,720

the legitimate heiress)

131
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
(to He's Group,)

132
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,920
(a rich and pampered girl
from a prestigious family.)

133
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,720
(Your return will attract)

134
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,680
(the attention and suspicion
of many people.)

135
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,120
(But as long as you play the role well,)

136
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
(I will help you)

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,560
(with the rest.)

138
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

139
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,520
today, I have invited you all
to a banquet
