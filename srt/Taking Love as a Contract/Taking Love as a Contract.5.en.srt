(Don't treat me as a cat's paw)

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,160
Right.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
I know everything about Shan.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
What a good girl.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,040
Why do you always make trouble for her?

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,040
Grandpa.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,200
Grandpa.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,240
Grandpa,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
let's take medicine.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,800
Grandpa.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,600
Don't worry.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,680
I've already settled Grandma.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Shen Yueran,

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,640
if it happened again,

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
you wouldn't afford it.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Xia Tian, how did you dare to hit me?

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
Are you okay?

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,160
If you hadn't found Grandma...

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
If Grandma

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,600
really had an accident,

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
what would I do?

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
How about

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,760
taking a rest for a while?

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
No.

35
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,200
I'll stay.

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
Aren't you afraid she will...

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,280
Since she always picks on me,

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,800
I'll teach her a lesson.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,200
So Mr. Ji,

40
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,600
the game has leveled up.

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,600
Can you pay me a bit more?

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,480
Xia Tian,

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,080
why did you transfer me
to a private room

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,800
with designated nurses?

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,440
I want you to feel comfortable.

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
How much does it cost?

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,480
I know

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
how much money you have,

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
right?

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,040
He paid for it?

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,200
Has he fallen for you?

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,120
Grandma.

53
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,080
I told you

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
that he is...

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,880
I can't tell.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,520
Such a pity.

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,280
Yeah.

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,200
The industry you engage in
is quite tolerant.

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,040
Hmm.

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
What?

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,240
Nothing.

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,600
Grandma, I'll see him off.
You take a good rest.

63
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,600
Thank you.

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,280
Not a big deal.

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,080
We are in a partnership.

66
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
Why did your grandma
mean by "being tolerant"?

67
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,360
It means...

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll do everything to your satisfaction
without mistakes.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Right.

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,200
Is that so?

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,080
Of course.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Boss,

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
you've agreed to increase my fee, right?

74
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,560
Don't call me like that.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,240
The VIP room is the extra money
I gave you.

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,120
No wonder you are so generous.

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
The wool comes from the sheep.

78
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,040
Are you the sheep?

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
Baa.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,600
Half for compensation
and half for reward.

81
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,400
If you have any objections,
talk to my lawyer.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
You evil capitalist.

83
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
Shan, you're back.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,920
It was all my fault last night.

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,720
I shouldn't have listened to
those rumors.

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,600
Look, these are the gifts
I bought for you.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Consider them as my apology.

89
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Yueran,

90
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,480
I was too agitated yesterday as well.

91
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
I apologize to you too.

92
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,680
Ouch.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,400
Ouch.

94
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
Ouch.

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
What happened?

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,640
My period seemed to come early,
as I was so angry yesterday.

97
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,560
I have a stomachache.

98
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
It's really painful.

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,200
Chengxuan, look...

100
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Are you feeling better?

101
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
No.

102
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,960
Yueran, why did you leave?

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,880
Take it slow.

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,720
I won't see you out
since I'm not feeling well.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
A little higher.

106
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,440
You acted well.

107
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
You also cooperated well. Thanks.

108
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,680
Is that how you thank me?

109
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,120
It cost me a lot of money

110
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
to hire you.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,640
Isn't a verbal thank-you enough?

112
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,680
I warn you

113
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,600
not to treat me as a cat's paw.

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
I just did.

115
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,760
So what?

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
If I really do something,

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,960
will you cooperate well?

118
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,920
Miss Shen.

119
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
What's the matter?

120
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Miss Shen, has Xia Tian shown
her true colors?

121
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,880
Then what about my rewards?

122
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,080
None of the ideas you put forward work.

123
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,680
You are shameless to ask for money.

124
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
It doesn't matter.

125
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I have another idea.

126
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,120
Another one?

127
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,880
Now you'd better

128
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,600
leave now.

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,680
Leave now!

130
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,200
Miss Shen.

131
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,200
Miss Shen,

132
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
as long as Mr. He sees Xia Tian and me

133
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,680
sleeping together,

134
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
her wedding to Ji Chengxuan
will naturally be called off.

135
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,560
If anything goes wrong this time,

136
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
I won't let you off.

137
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,680
Don't worry.
You don't need to show up this time.

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,240
You just need to do me a favor.

139
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,320
Take care, Miss Shen.

140
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,840
Will you cooperate well?

141
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:11,808
(Zou Bo: I've found a way about the house,
but I need your signature.)

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,280
Hello?

143
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,520
Okay, let's talk in person.
Where are you?

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,840
Xia Tian,

145
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
you should have been my woman long ago.

146
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,400
Today you can't escape anymore.

147
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
Coming.

148
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,480
We can talk in person now.

149
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,320
Go ahead.

150
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
I just want to ask you a question.

151
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
Do you really want
to be with Ji Chengxuan?

152
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,760
You know he doesn't love you at all.

153
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,840
He's just taking advantage of you.

154
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Once he's tired of you,

155
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,640
he will dump you.

156
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,960
I am the one...

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,000
I am the one who truly loves you.

158
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Zou Bo,

159
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,680
it has

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
nothing to do with you.

161
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,960
But that house

162
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,360
is my grandmother's only property.

163
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,120
Quickly give me
the property certificate.

164
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,000
Xia Tian,

165
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,280
are you really that pragmatic?

166
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,160
Can you

167
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,120
only share happiness but not struggles?

168
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Did you ask me
just to hear this nonsense?

169
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm leaving now.

170
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,760
Xia Tian.

171
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,280
