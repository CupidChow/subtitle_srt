=Taking Love as a Contract=

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,548
=Episode 3=
(Contact depends on the professionalism)

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,480
I agree to cooperate with you.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,920
Is it because I taught
that bad guy a lesson for you?

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,760
Anyway, I have my conditions too.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,400
(Cooperation Agreement)

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
Since it's a partnership,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
there should be a formal contract.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,200
I don't want the unclear situations

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,920
from before to happen again.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,120
Firstly,

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
the cooperation is limited to one month

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
and will terminate upon expiry.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,320
Before I get the property,

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
you can't leave.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
Just as I guessed,

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
you're after the property.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,760
Since you've assumed so,

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,480
then this makes communication
more efficient.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,360
But if you weren't capable

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,480
and failed to get the property,

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,600
would I really have to marry you?

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,400
Three months.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,880
Okay.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,600
Secondly,

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,440
no excessive physical contact.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,720
What do you mean?

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,280
I don't want
excessive physical contact with you.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
Our contact

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,720
depends on your professionalism.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
In certain situations,

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,640
some intimate actions are inevitable.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,040
We can discuss what level
of intimacy is acceptable.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
How intimate will it be?

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
What level are you comfortable with?

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
Like

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,360
this kind,

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,280
and

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
this kind.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Also,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,360
this kind.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,400
All work for me.

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,200
You judge for yourself.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,760
Just don't be too fake.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,680
We'll do a fake one if we need to.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,360
Thirdly,

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280
I hope we both can have
the spirit of the contract.

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,600
The moment there is malicious intent
or overstepping behavior,

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,480
the contract

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,520
will be terminated immediately.

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,600
Who knows if you'll take advantage of me

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
or do a real one?

62
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,480
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm warning you.

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
I am a bad woman.

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,880
You'd better not fall for me.

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,840
Miss Xia,

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,920
I advise you not to be overly confident.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,520
Mr. Ji,

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I also advise you to be fully composed.

70
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,880
Well, then,

71
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,600
I'll make it clear first.

72
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,160
If your poor acting is exposed,

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,680
then you won't get a single penny.

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,440
Deal.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,680
There won't be any more hitches
this time, right?

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
Of course not.

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,680
From now on, I am He Shanyue.

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,200
Chengxuan.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,240
Yueran?

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,160
Are you surprised to see me?

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
When did you come back?

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,760
I couldn't wait to see you
as soon as I returned.

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,680
Do you miss me?

84
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,240
Yueran, I am Shan.

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
Do you still remember me?

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,960
Let's go. Grandpa is waiting for us.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
Food's all here.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Grandpa.

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
These are

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
top-notch ingredients

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,160
that I had someone

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,320
air-ship from Japan.

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
They are good for your health.

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,160
Please have a taste.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,680
Okay.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,920
Now the whole family is together.

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,120
This is what home feels like.

98
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
Look what I found.

99
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
How did the rainbow trout

100
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
get mixed in this salmon?

101
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,200
Imported one is just different
from domestic one.

102
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,680
Is that right, Shan?

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,280
Didn't you personally organize
the family banquet?

104
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,600
How could you make a mistake like this?

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
I don't know

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
how the servants handle things.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Someone snuck in.

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,840
And now I have to personally

109
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,320
pick the one out.

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,760
Shan, you understand, right?

111
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,720
Chengxuan,

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,640
I want to eat rainbow trout.

113
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,080
Cheng...

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,400
Strange.

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Why does it taste just as good?

116
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,600
Because

117
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
my fiance

118
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,000
personally fed me.

119
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
Have you had enough?

120
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
You should stop.

121
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,920
She is the one who provoked it first.

122
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
You should ask her if she's had enough.

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Grandpa.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,680
Look,

125
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,720
Shan is still as naughty
as she was when she was little.

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,160
Shan,

127
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,880
I remember you were very picky
as a little girl.

128
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,520
Is that so?

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,000
Back then, you were especially immature.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
We even fought over food.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,520
Do you remember?

132
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,360
No, I don't.

133
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
How could you not remember?

134
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,080
You even got a scar from it.

135
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,760
Grandpa, this is good. Please try some.

136
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,240
Okay.

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,520
You cried
for three whole days over this.

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
How could you not remember?

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
Shan has been lost for too long.

140
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
It's normal not to remember.

141
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,280
Fine, she forgot it.

142
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
But she has that scar, right?

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Take it off and let's see.

144
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,320
Stop fooling around.

145
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm not fooling around,

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,200
Grandpa.

147
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,920
How did she suddenly come back
after being lost for so long?

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,200
You can't believe her without doubt

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,440
just because she looks like my aunt.

150
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,520
Grandpa,

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,480
I brought Shan back.

152
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,320
I can take her away,

153
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,880
so she won't always be suspected.

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Leave now.

155
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,400
Stop.

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
Let me see.

157
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
Shen Yueran.

158
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
Yueran,

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,280
you used to bully me
when we were little,

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,120
and now you're giving me a hard time.

161
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,440
No, Grandpa. I just...

162
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
Enough!

163
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,640
Yueran.

164
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,080
You can go to rest.

165
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,280
I do not want
such a thing to happen again.

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,200
It's okay now.

167
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,480
Shan.

168
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm being inconsiderate today.

169
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,000
I have prepared gifts
for you and Chengxuan.

170
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,520
Who are you?

171
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
Miss Shen,
are you interested in collaboration?

172
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,200
We held hands once and hugged twice.

173
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Please pay it now.

174
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,520
Weren't you the one

175
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,040
trying to rile up Shen Yueran?

176
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,960
Isn't it just because she likes you?

177
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,360
That's why she was messing with me.

178
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
If I hadn't been so prepared,

179
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
I'd have been exposed today.

180
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,800
Resolving crises
is also part of your job.

181
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,960
Mr. Ji,

182
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
do you refuse to pay
because you can't afford it?

183
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,560
If you want me

184
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,280
to pay for all your actions,

185
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,440
I won't do it

186
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
unless I'm your fiance.

187
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
Stop taking advantage of me.

188
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,360
Hurry up and get changed.

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,360
Do I look good, Grandpa?

190
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,520
Yes.

191

Our Shan is good-looking.

192
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,400
It's not convenient for me
to put on shoes by myself

193
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,760
with this dress on.

194
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,360
What are you waiting for, Chengxuan?

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,800
(How does it feel, Mr. Ji?)

196
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,360
(Are you happy to put on shoes for me?)

197
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,440
(Are you challenging my patience?)

198
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,080
(So what if I am?)

199
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
(Don't you still have to do it?)
