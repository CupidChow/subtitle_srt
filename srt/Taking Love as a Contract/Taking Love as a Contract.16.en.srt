(I'm a liar, and I don't deserve it)

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,480
Hello.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,920
It's me.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,760
My grandma's gone?

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,480
Where did she go?

16
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,656
(7 days later)

17
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:06,592
(Mourn)

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,880
(Xia Tian,)

19
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,040
(you aren't coming around)

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
(to see me as much lately.)

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,640
(Now you aren't gonna call me)

22
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,720
(unless I call you first?)

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,840
(Grandma, I've got something
to do right now.)

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
(I'll get back to it
and call you back later.)

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,640
I know.

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,080
I know it's a huge shock to you
that your grandma suddenly passed away.

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,080
I also know
that whatever anyone says now

28
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,520
won't help.

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,280
But Xia Tian,

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,160
you need to get through
this on your own.

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Your grandma must also hope

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,840
that you can continue to live well.

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
You thought I wanted to commit suicide?

34
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,800
I just found myself

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,040
really good at acting.

36
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,880
I lied to my grandma,

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
saying I took on a big project,

38
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
and that the house was still there.

39
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,880
And in the end,
I was still lying to her.

40
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,880
Shen Yueran was right.

41
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
I kept on acting.

42
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,240
Now even heaven couldn't stand watching.

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,960
This is my retribution.

44
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,080
You should believe

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,960
your grandma would not blame you.

46
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,680
But I can't forgive myself.

47
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,360
Ji Chengxuan,

48
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
I don't want to act anymore.

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,320
Let's end

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
our contract.

51
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm going to say farewell to Grandpa.

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Shan,

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,760
come here and see

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
what I prepared for you.

55
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,840
Shan,

56
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,840
I heard about

57
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,840
your grandmother's death.

58
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm grieved too.

59
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,040
She raised you with much hardship,

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,240
and look how smart, kind,

61
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
gorgeous

62
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
and graceful

63
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,160
you've become.

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
I am happy about it.

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,200
It's just a pity

66
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
that I didn't get to thank her
in person.

67
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,400
I know

68
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,840
you must be feeling terrible.

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't know how to comfort you.

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,400
I can only give you these mundane things

71
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
to make you feel better.

72
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
I'm not sure if you like them.

73
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,160
Shan,

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,800
don't cry.

75
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,280
Don't worry.

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,080
I will take extra good care of you

77
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
and cherish you twice
as much as your grandma would.

78
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,160
Grandpa, I am not He Shanyue.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,160
My name is Xia Tian.

80
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,080
I've deceived you all.

81
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,400
I am just a liar.

82
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,120
I don't deserve your love.

I've already told Mr. He

91
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
the truth.

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,680
I've already left

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,520
the He family.

94
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,160
That's pretty good.

95
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
It's not too late.

96
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,400
It's already too late.

97
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,880

99
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
I thought

100
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
you never wanted to see me again.

101
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,320
Do you

102
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,240
still remember

103
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
last time, at this same place perhaps,

104
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
I told you

105
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,120
to keep things real?

106
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,440
Actually, my words

107
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,760
were quite harsh that day.

108
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,400
But my intention was really
for the company's good.

110
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
I know.

111
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,360
Since you've left the He family,

112
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
why don't you go home?

113
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,240
Now,

114
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
I don't have a home.

115
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
What about him?

116
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,360
