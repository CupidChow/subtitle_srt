00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,080
Ji Chengxuan,
you're making me so embarrassed.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,000
What are you doing?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,040
Why? It's not embarrassing.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
Come on.

Calm down.

I can't calm down.

Calm down for a moment.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Don't do it.

24

Miss Xia Tian,

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
maybe

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,720
our encounter

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,640
wasn't perfect.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,440
It started with interests

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,800
and

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
was interspersed with countless lies.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Your acting is superb,

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
and I am

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
Would someone speak about
himself like that?

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,120
Okay, be serious.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,400

are the most insincere

in the world,

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,520
but we are also

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,000
I realized that ten percent

57

is the most important in my life.

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,960

the remaining 90 percent

109

Grandpa,

110
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
all of this is my fault.

111
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,000
I hired Xia Tian to put on this act.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,520
She disagreed with
deceiving you from the start.

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,400
It's not like that.

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
I wanted to make money.

115
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
I was the one who deceived you.

116
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
It has nothing to do with Chengxuan.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Now you know you were wrong.

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,760
What took you so long?

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,360
With these little tricks of yours,

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,160
do you think you can fool me?

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,480
I knew it all along.

122
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,840
Actually,

123
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I'd been looking for Shan.

124
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,880
I'd searched nearly everywhere
at home and abroad,

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,520
and yet, I found no news of her.

126
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
Until a few years ago,

127
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
I received news

128
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,640
that she had died
in a car accident long ago.

129
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,280
So, over these years,

130
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,840
I've been very sad

131
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
and guilty.

132
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,080
I failed to protect her.

133
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,760
Later on,

134
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,400
you had her put on an act.

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
On one hand,

136
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
I wanted to make up for some regrets.

137
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
On the other hand,

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,840
considering

139
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,400
the company's situation back then,

140
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
I just played along

141
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
with you.

142
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,640
At first, I saw you as just an actor,

143
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
but I didn't expect

144
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,960
that you would be

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,160
so clever,

146
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,240

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
After spending some time with you,

148
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,200
I didn't want to let you go,

149
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,160
so

150
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,360

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
