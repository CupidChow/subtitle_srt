(I can make time)

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
We're proposing

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,400
a unique vacation fishing village

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,240
that benefits both tourists and locals.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,720
Any questions?

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,960
I have one.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,280
Miss He,

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,520
ever done the math for the company?

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,520
The new plan

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,520
means five million more just for design,

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,160
plus extra for labor

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,200
and time.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
If the profit falls short,

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,120
who will cover

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,920
the losses?

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Obviously, whoever's pushing for it.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
Miss He,

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,640
if this new fancy plan backfires,

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,000
and we take a hit in both reputation

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
and profits,

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,600
what are you gonna do then?

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
I...

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,800
Our plan...

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
She pitches this new idea,

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,800
but I'm the one calling the shots on it.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
You also came up
with the old plan, Mr. Ji,

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,320
remember?

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,520
Does this mean

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,400
you are admitting
that your past decisions

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,920
were wrong?

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,440
Yes, I messed up.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,320
I'll take full responsibility
for the new plan.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,360
If it tanks,

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
it's on me.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,440
Yes.

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,120
That's the plan.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,480
Yeah.

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,520
(He's really helping me out.)

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,920
(Maybe I should do something nice?)

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,720
Hey,

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
want to grab food on Saturday?

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,200
Here's the thing, Jeff.

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,000
We need to cut costs
and speed things up.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
Yep, that's the idea.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960
At least five percent more.

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
(Sure, I can make time.)

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,480
1260 yuan on Alipay,

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
plus 680 yuan on WeChat.

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,200
Two grand should cover it?

60
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,840
Nah, too cheap.

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,160
Can't skimp when treating someone,

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,040
Xia Tian.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
Especially

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,120
with Ji Chengxuan,

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,440
that fancy and picky one.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,720
Let's go with five grand.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
Ugh, gonna hurt the wallet, though.

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
Sorry I'm late.

69
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,440
I was in a rush
and didn't even have time for makeup.

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,360
No problem.

71
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,040
I just threw on whatever
and came out too.

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,440
So, what are we having for dinner?

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,160
How about here?

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,120
Really?

75
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,960
Come on.

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
There's a table.

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,760
Quit zoning out.

78
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,280
Order something.

79
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,840
Thanks for saving my budget, Mr. Ji.

80
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,720
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
This place
has amazing pig trotter noodles.

82
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
I've seen them on TV.

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Back in the day...

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,600
Don't tell me
you saved the meat and noodles

85
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,320
for your little sister and brother

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,640
while you were starving.

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,360
We can go somewhere else

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,320
if you don't like it.

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Nah, it's fine.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,120
Excuse me. Excuse me.

91
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,320
Spicy intestine noodles, please.

92
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
I'll take pig trotter noodles.

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,920
No problem.

94
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,880
Can't have noodles

95
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,520
without garlic.

96
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120
Garlic and noodles,

97
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,120
a perfect match.

98
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Are you OK?

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,040
Yeah.

100
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,200
Thank you.

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
I'm fine.

102
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,880
Give it a try.

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,480
What do you think?

104
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
Is this wine

105
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
fancy enough for your taste?

106
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,480
(First dinner,)

107
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
(and now champagne.)

108
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,720
(What is going on here?)

109
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
I guess,

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
you get it, right?

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,040
I

112
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,920
want to

113
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
tell you something.

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,920
We've only known each other

115
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
for a month.

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,200
But we've been through stuff.

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,040
You found my grandma,

118
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,960
and helped me a lot at work.

119
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm seeing

120
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,520
a whole new side of you.

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,800
I know we're in it for business.

122
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
But,

123
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
there's something

124
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,480
