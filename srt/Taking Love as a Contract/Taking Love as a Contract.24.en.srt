It was too exaggerated.

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Fine.

Chengxuan.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,440
Why are you here?

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,320
Actually, I've never quite understood

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
why I'm not good enough.

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Is it because
my figure isn't good enough,

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,320
or because I'm not pretty enough?

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,560
I've liked you since I was young.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,600
I have dreamed

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,760
of marrying you with a hefty dowry.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Do you like this type?

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,440
Then I will become like her.

56

Chengxuan.

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,480
You know well

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,520
that it's impossible for us

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
even without her.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Chengxuan, I don't want to know it.

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,120
You can't keep rejecting me.

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
You can't.

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,960
Shen Yueran.

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,520
It's impossible between you.

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
Stay level-headed.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
It's all because of you

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
that I've lost everything.

68
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,920
Chengxuan was supposed to be mine.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
The He family's fortune was also
supposed to be mine.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,400
It's all because you showed up

71
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,640
that everything was ruined.

72
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,080
Do you want me to stay level-headed?

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
Shen Yueran.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,240
Everything you've done

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
indicates that you have been selfish

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
and insatiable.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Stop saying.

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
No.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,680
Don't let me see you in the future.

80
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,640
(Since I can't have you,)

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,440
(let's die together.)

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,240
So where are we going to live?

83
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,600
Where do you want to live?

84
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,680
Me?

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,640
I will certainly live in my own house,

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,280
but you want to live
in your ancestral home.

87
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:33,627
(One year later)

88
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,080
How did you sleep last night?

89
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,360
Are you feeling okay today?

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,760
I just came back from Mrs. Yang's place.

91
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,720
Her guesthouse opened today

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,560
and business is booming.

93
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,320
She said

94
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,960
we can go there later

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,200
and stay for free.

96
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,840
Also,

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,480
Shen Yueran wrote me an apology letter.

98
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,360
But what's the use of an apology?

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,080
Let her reflect on her wrongdoing
in prison.

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,880
Rest assured.

101
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Grandpa and the company
are doing exceedingly well.

102
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,640
No,

103
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
you can't be too relaxed.

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,320
