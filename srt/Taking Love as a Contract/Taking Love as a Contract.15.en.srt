whenever I was bullied,

101
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,080
I would hide here.

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,640
One day,

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
I met Grandpa here.

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,360
He gave me a gift.

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,840
Later, Grandpa went through
the procedures to adopt me.

106
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,120
He sent me to school

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
and taught me company management.

108
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
Although we're not blood-related,

109
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,200
he is my only family.

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
So

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
you were adopted by Grandpa.

112
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Now, Grandpa's health
is deteriorating day by day.

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,120
But there are too many people
coveting his money.

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
Rather than letting
those people carve it up,

115
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,880
it's better for me to be the villain.

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,520
But you have outstanding abilities

117
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
and you are devoted to the family.

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,720
Why didn't Grandpa
just give you the family property?

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,320
Do you know why Grandpa
dotes on you so much?

120
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,880
Because...

121
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
I understand now.

122
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Because He Shanyue
is his biological granddaughter.

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,240
But you are not his blood.

124
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
In front of bloodline,

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,680
ability is nothing.

126
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
But lately, I've started to waver.

127
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,760
I don't know
if what I am doing is right.

128
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,080

132
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,640

135
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520

please don't leave me.

142
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,160

00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,440
you are Miss Shen from the He family.

Xia Tian,

149
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,360
I think it's best
if you leave our company.

150
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,880

151
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,680
Xia Tian or He Shanyue?

152
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
None of us knows.

153
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
But you know best yourself.

in the stock price today?

Will you feel guilty about it?

163
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,720

164

165
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,800
