(The handkerchief carried along)

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,440
How come you are here?

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
I've been calling you just now.

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,760
My phone's dead.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Why did you share headphones with him?

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,760
Actually,

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,400
I really hope every time you feel down,

18
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,440
I can be the one by your side.

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm not going to cry.

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,240
Why do you always carry a handkerchief?

21
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,360
It was just part of the outfit at first.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,280
Later on, it was prepared for you.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,080
Look

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
how good I am to you.

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,480
Alright.

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,920
Let's go home.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
I've decided

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,320
to leave the He family for good,

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
and

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't know how to face Grandpa.

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,880
I've disappointed him too much.

32
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,840
It's okay.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
I'll take you to a place.

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,280
Where?

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,320
Let's go.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
Mrs. Yang.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,200
Hey, you guys.

38
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,000
We're here.

39
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,280
Mrs. Yang's B&B is about to open.

40
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
I told her we'd come over to help.

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,040
Mrs. Yang,

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,360
is there anything we can do for you?

43
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,200
I'll leave this painting to you

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,280
and go back to cook.

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,600
But I can't paint.

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,880
It doesn't matter.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Come and sit.

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Sit down.

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,240
How can I show this off
when it's painted like this?

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
I think it's pretty good.

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,160
Leave the rest to me.

52
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,680
Does it look good?

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,000
She is in the paintings.

54
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
She is the wind.

55
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,520
She is the air.

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,840
