I know you still care about me.

Take one step away

and I will die right before you.

Go back.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,080
I won't go, Chengxuan.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,800
Chengxuan,

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,280
why did you conspire with that bumpkin

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
to set me up?

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,440

Chengxuan,

Chengxuan,

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,920
why did you change your clothes?

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,160
I saw you at the bar.

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,680
Chengxuan,

39
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,200
tell me.

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
In what way am I not better
than that bumpkin?

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,720
Say it.

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,920
How can she compare to you?

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
You are much more enticing than her.

I bought you a gift.

68
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I want to apologize to you.

69
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,880
For what?

70
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,760
I blew you off today.

71
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,840
So how expensive a gift do you think

72
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,800
can make up for it?

73
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
The money is not important.

74
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,480
What's important is

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,400
that I want to say sorry to you.

76
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,320
Hermès.

77
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,760
You even bought my right to be angry.

78
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,640
Today, it was my fault.

79
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
But I had my reason.

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,960
Yes.

81
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,760
Again, a reason.

82
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,120
So I'm making a fuss, right?

83
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,240
I saw the gift you gave me.

84
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,200
I really like it,

85
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,200
so I thought

86
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
I should also buy you a gift

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,760
as an apology.

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,520
Ji Chengxuan,

89
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,800
do you know how much
I spent on your gift?

90
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,920
You got me an Hermès bag.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,720
Do you think
these two gifts are equivalent?

92
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
I thought you would like it.

93
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,600
But did you ask if I like it?

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,880
Ji Chengxuan,

95
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,080
do you think

96
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,600
that money can solve everything?

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
So do you actually dislike this gift

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
or will you not accept my apology?

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
I accept it.

100
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,440
You bought me a bag as an apology.

101
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
How dare I not accept it?

102
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,280
Do you have to speak in that tone?

103
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Yes.

104
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
Let me tell you.

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm too good

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,880
for such a bag.

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,720
If you don't need it, throw it away.

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,040
Get out!

109
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,240
What are you doing?

110
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,280
You want to sleep with me for free?

111
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,840
You just throw me out

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
after last night's pleasure?

113
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,080
Women are so fickle.

114
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Just yesterday,
she was hugging and kissing me.

115
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,800
My shoes!

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
I knew it.

117
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,720
You were very satisfied last night.

118
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,920
Shut your mouth and scram!

119
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Hello.

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,840
Don't.

121
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,200
Don't auction off my house.

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160

123
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Okay.

124
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,960
I will pay it back today.

126
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,680
Where can I scrape together the money?

127
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
Where is it?

128
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,920
It's here.

129
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,160
I didn't break it, right?

130
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,800
It's fine.

131
