(No, I am a professional actress)

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,040
I've long known
something was off about her.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,400
Surely someone as smart as you

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,920
must have noticed.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
I was worried sick,

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,120
thinking you were
really enchanted by her.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Enchanted by her?

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,800
Yeah, you are together day and night.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,120
She's just an actress.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,440
Then I'm relieved.

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,880
You heard it all.

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,040
Yes.

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,600
I heard it all.

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,240
I will pack my things and leave.

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
Do you believe me?

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
Do you think I'd tell my true feelings

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
to Shen Yueran?

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,880
What about the things
you told me before?

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360
Were those true?

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
I want to apologize to you.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,600
Apologize for what?

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
First,

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,800
that pig trotter noodles place

35
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,160
is where I used to go often as a boy.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,480
I just wanted to share it with you.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,080
(But)

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400
it seemed that I was inconsiderate.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,760
Second,

40
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
I shouldn't have kissed you

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,320
(without your permission.)

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
Third,

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,080
I shouldn't have disrespected
your taste in music.

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
Although

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,600
it really isn't very pleasant
to the ear.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,600
It's just a business deal between us.

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
Why apologize?

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Grandpa,

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
wontons have to be made
and cooked fresh.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
Please try them while they're hot.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,840
What?

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
A bowl of wontons as a birthday gift?

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
You're really lacking sincerity.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,080
This is made by Shan herself.

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,320
I must try it.

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
How is it?

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
Is it not tasty?

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
What's wrong, Grandpa?

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,960
When my mother was still around,

60
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,160
she used to make wontons for me often.

61
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Back then,

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
it was very cold outside,

63
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
and we were very poor.

64
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,280
My mother just liked

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,480
to add pepper to the wonton filling.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Unexpectedly,

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
I tasted this flavor again today.

68
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
It's good.

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Grandpa, if you like it,
I'll make it for you more often.

70
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Okay.

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,040
Grandpa, let's cut the cake.

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
Come on.

73
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,120
Cut the cake.

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,760
Okay.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll do it.

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,520
I'll help you.

77
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,200
What are you doing?

78
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
My bad.

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Let me help you.

80
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,440
Go help Shan with her wound.

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,080
You should be more careful.

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,320
Grandpa,

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,960
I'll go take a look.

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,280
Why did you pull me so hard just now?

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,520
My hand is injured.

86
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,400
You don't comfort me but blame me.

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,920
Is there a fiancé like you?

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,360
Miss Xia,

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,760
I already know who you are.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,440
But I didn't expose you,

91
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,360
because today
is my grandfather's birthday.

92
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,360
You, a vulgar actress, think

93
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,760
you're qualified
to have me as your fiancé?

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,040
So you know it all.

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
So what?

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
If it weren't for the He family,

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,760
you think I would want
to show affection with you?

98
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,920
I wouldn't touch you
with a ten-foot pole.

99
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
What are you doing?

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,360
She's gone.

101
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,200
Stop dissing me.

102
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,840
I am a professional actress.

103
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
All my lines are delivered
with genuine emotion.

104
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,360
Is that so?

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
I don't remember
there would be these many lines.

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,880
I have the final say on all the lines.

107
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,200
Fine.

108
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,280
Grandpa.

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,080
Is Shan okay?

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,920
Yes.

111
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,600
No big deal.

112
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
That's good.

113
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
Shan, you're alright?

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah, I'm fine.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,320
I heard the two of you arguing.

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,480
No, we weren't.

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,400
Chengxuan just told me

118
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,120
to stop being so fidgety.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,080
He got a bit loud.

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Grandpa,

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,680
I've got something to do, so I'll leave.

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,520
Alright.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
Go ahead with your work.

125
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,440
Grandpa,

126
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
let's continue cutting the cake.

127
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,880
Okay.

128
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,840
Why is the wound so deep?

129
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,640
You gave me a scare.

130
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,400
It hurts.

131
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,920
Oh, right.

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,160
Did you bring it back?

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Shen Yueran must have never expected

134
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
that it was cow's blood.

135
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,840
In this way,

136
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
the DNA results will surely be
in disarray.

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
It can't be used as any evidence.

138
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,080
But today is Grandpa's birthday.

139
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,800
He was so happy.

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,200
If he knew we deceived him,
he'd be so sad.

141
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,320
Grandpa values family ties.

142
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
We really shouldn't.

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,920
But this was my decision.

144
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
It's unrelated to you.

145
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
How can it be unrelated?

146
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Can you please be more careful?

147
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,160
Why are you so good to me?

148
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,920
Keep treating me so good

149
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
