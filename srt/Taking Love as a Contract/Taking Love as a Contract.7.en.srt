(Just do as I say)

12
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,520
Where is my office?

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
This way.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,440
Chengxuan.

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,760
Looks like I'm a PD now.

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,400
This chair is really comfy.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,080
But it's a bit too tall.

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,320
How about now?

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,240
Miss He.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,640
Just so-so.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,360
Joining the company is no joke.

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,360
Changshou Village...

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,520
That house owner in Changshou Village

24
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,120
still won't budge.

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,880
Why don't you just go get your coffee

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,760
and take selfies, Miss He?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,640
Leave projects to someone

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,320
who is professional.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,000
Listen, Shen Yueran.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,920
Watch this. We're both PDs.

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I can handle things just like you can.

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,480
This is a pretty
specialized project proposal.

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,360
Can you make sense of it?

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
Or shall I explain it to you?

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
I get it. Stubborn homeowner.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,600
You plan to knock down their house.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you think they'll go for it?

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
Sounds like you disagree.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
That's tricky,

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,160
because it was Mr. Ji's idea.

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Shan just joined us,

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,360
still figuring things out.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,880
I'll help her catch up.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,320
You go ahead.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,920
Ji Chengxuan,

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
people have feelings.

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,840
You can't just knock down someone's home
they've lived in for a lifetime.

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,080
I wouldn't be cool with that, either.

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,600
We'll compensate villagers

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,160
with over 20% more than market value.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,440
Not again.

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,760
Can money really fix everything?

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,040
Don't you see an issue
with your proposal?

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
There is no negotiation.

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,280
If you'd like to step in,

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,960
take a good look

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,000
at the project proposal, okay?

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
It's more than just a project.

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
It's about meeting emotional needs.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Since you're in charge of the project,

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,760
maybe it's time

62
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,640
to optimize your proposal.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Xia Tian,

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
you really have no idea about business.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you know about market?

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,440
Your so-called emotional needs

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,400
don't really matter
in the big market picture,

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,600
got it?

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,680
Let me remind you.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,800
You're just playing He Shanyue.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,760
You're not the real Miss He.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,400
Get that straight.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,240
Do you even realize

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,520
you've got me playing He Shanyue

75
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,920
just to fight for the family money?

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I didn't pay you
to come here and boss around.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,160
Just do as I say.

78
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
Since I'm stepping into
He Shanyue's shoes,

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,480
I can't just turn a blind eye

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,360
to the issues in the project.

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
There's so much to do.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
God, please help me.

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,160
Hi.

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,520
You're welcome.

86
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,600
So it's yours?

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,400
I love this song.

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
It's kinda niche.

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Niche?

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,000
I've been listening to it for years.

91
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,920
And look, that girl over there

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,520
was totally into it too.

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,480
You can tell she knows the song well.

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,920
She's got noise-canceling earphones on,

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
lost in her own music.

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
That's how it is here.

97
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Everyone can blend in
without bothering each other.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Blending in,

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,840
without bothering each other.

100
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,440
(You plan to knock down their house.)

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
(Do you think they'll go for it?)

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
I get it now.

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Thank you.

104
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:52,640

Are you waiting for me?

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
Maybe.

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
I know you are.

116
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,240
Since you're so full of yourself,

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,600
I won't argue.

118
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
So, my chauffeur,

119
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
ready to go?

(Mr. Ji,)

121
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,760
(can you do me a solid)

122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
(and come to Changshou Village
with me tomorrow?)

123
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,600
(Not interested.)

124
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,240
Come on. Hurry up.

125
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Seriously, I could use a hand here.

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,240
Maybe we shouldn't go in then?

127
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
Open the door.

128
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,680
Coming.

129
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,240
Mrs. Yang, I'm Xia.

130
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
You're so sweet, Xia.
But no need for all these gifts.

131
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,280
Do you

132
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,520
know each other?

133
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,120
We talked online.

134
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
Believe it or not,

135
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm here to help
with her guesthouse plan.

136
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
Come on in and take a seat.

137
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,400
Okay.

138
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,640
Do you think running a guesthouse here
is a good idea, Xia?

139
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,200
Definitely.

140
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,840
Guesthouses are super trendy
among young people these days.

141
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,840
And this place is perfect.
Great location,

142
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
fresh air,

143
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,000
and with unique rooms.

144
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,440
Just trust me,

145
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,080
and we can turn it into a famous spot

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,840
with tons of guests every day.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
The only issue with this house

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,520
is that it's in the middle of nowhere.
My stubborn old man is to blame.

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
Young people
love discovering hidden gems.

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
It's got that nature feel, you know?

151
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,840
And think about it.

152
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,200
Living alone can be pretty boring.

153
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,120
Having some young guests around,

154
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,720
chatting and stuff,
sounds like a good plan, right?

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,280
Sure. Let's give it a shot, Xia.

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
Okay.

157
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,960
I've brought you your first guest.

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,240
What are you up to?

159
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,040
Get her a customer.

160
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
For what?

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,880
Book this place online now.

162
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,920
You're going to stay here tonight.

163
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Tomorrow, write a super positive review

164
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,400
with at least 300 words.

165
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,960
Do it now.

166
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,680
Grab your phone. Now.

167
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
Mrs. Yang, would you
go get the room ready?

168
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,200
Tonight, we'll be roommates,

169
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,640
and let's keep an eye
on our first guest.

170
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,320
Alright, I'm on it.

171
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,280
Listen,

172
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,360
this guesthouse thing is a first to me.

173
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,760
Everyone has a first time.

174
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,280
Mm, okay.

175
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,700

Okay.

178
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:10,960
Okay.

179
