I'm sorry.

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,760
Don't be mad

15

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,240
I'm not here for water.

If you harass her again,

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,200
I'll make you dead.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,240
How did you know I was here?

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,640
You are the daughter of He family

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,240
and my fiancee.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,760
This hotel belongs to He's Group.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,800
The manager saw you
checking in with a strange man.

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
Could he not tell me?

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
You're sweating so much.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,720

for ransom,

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
would you pay it?

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
That depends on how much he demands.

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
It seems

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,320
I'd definitely be doomed.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Why is it

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
so hot here?

Making such a big noise.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm wondering what Grandpa's reaction

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,360
would be seeing you like this.

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,120
Grandpa.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Grandpa.

103
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
What's going on, Yue?

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,760
I saw Shan with another man

105
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
enter this room together.

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,320
I'm worried about her safety,

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,840
but I fear she might misunderstand me.

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,240
So I called you over.

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,120
What?

110
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,680
Open the door now.

111
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
You two?

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,960
Grandpa, we're not...
You've misunderstood.

113
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,400
Just this?

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,280
Yueran, don't overreact.

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm waiting to meet my great-grandson.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,960
It's not... Grandpa...

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
(Zou Bo)

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,600

119
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,080
(Ji Chengxuan.)

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
You lose.

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,560
So sweet.

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,440
But I don't like coffee in the morning.

123
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,640
I don't see any terms related to
preparing breakfast in the contract.

124
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Neither taking care of you
like yesterday.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,120
What's wrong with you?

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
You've breached the contract,

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,440
Mr. Ji,

128
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
according to Article 3.

129
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,640
Third,

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,400
I hope we both can have
the spirit of the contract.

131
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,520
The moment there is malicious intent
or overstepping behavior,

132
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,360
the contract

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,200
will be terminated immediately.

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Merchants prioritize
the spirit of contract.

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
The incident was caused
by force majeure.

136
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
It was clearly stated in the contract

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,120
that it's impossible for me to...

138
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
What is it?

139
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,840
To be attracted to you.

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
That's great.

141
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,080
Once the contract ends,
we don't have to see each other again.

142
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,880
Sorry to say that,

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,400
but during the term of contract,

144
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,040
you'll see me not only at home

145
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
but at work.

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,400
What do you mean?

147
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,680
From today on, Grandpa wants you

148
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,960
to go to the company with me.

149
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Work two jobs?

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
Work is also part of being He Shanyue.

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,360
You...

152
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,840
You can just be my secretary.

153
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,560
Ji Chengxuan.

154
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,320
Does Shen Yueran also work there?

155
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,800
That's a problem.

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Although I'm not the real He Shanyue,

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,080
what she should have

158
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
shouldn't be deprived of

159
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,840
because I play the role of her.

160
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
What do you think?

161
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Speak plainly.

162
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,280
I'll do the same job
as Shen Yueran does.

163
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,080
Are you going to fight her till the end?

164
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,840
With the identity of He Shanyue,

165
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
how could I be a secretary?

166
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,920
Or, about this,

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
you don't have the final say, Mr. Ji?

168
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,440
