(Why don't you live in your house?)

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,480
Shan,

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,120
you really look so much like your mom.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,080
You're the spitting image.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
This wedding dress and this suit

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,080
were worn by your parents
on their wedding day.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,360
It's just a pity

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,120
that they had an accident

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,280
not long after you were born.

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,560
Grandpa,

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,560
you got me.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,160
From now on, I'll keep you company.

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,360
I've left you a house.

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,240
After a while, you can move in

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,600
to live closer to me.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,880
I'll make the arrangements.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
Then, thank you, Grandpa.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
Silly child,

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,640
being able to see you

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,760
and Chengxuan

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,080
living happily

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,600
would leave me with no regrets.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,720
Grandpa, rest assured.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,880
I promise I'll take good care of Shan.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,800
Grandpa,

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,120
I've just returned.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,440
I don't want to get married so soon.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
I want to spend more time with you.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,960
How about

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,280
postponing my wedding by three months?

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,200
What do you think?

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Okay, whatever you say.

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
Then I'll move in and live with her.

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Anyway,

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,520
we're in a lovey-dovey relationship.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
No.

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Ji Chengxuan, I don't agree.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,280
Chengxuan,

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,040
are you really going
to stop living in your big house

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,600
and go to live together
with that bumpkin?

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
She has a name.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Her name is He Shanyue.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,960
I don't believe she's genuine one.

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Have you forgotten?
We were childhood friends.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,080
We grew up and went abroad together,

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,960
and you even promised me.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
What?

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
That we'd grow old together.

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,560
You said it when you were little.

60
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
Chengxuan.

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
I don't remember anymore.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,400
You are drunk.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,640
No, I am not, Chengxuan.

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,440
I am so beautiful now.

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't you like me?

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
Don't you want me?

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,560
Mm?

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,800
Mm?

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Mm?

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Yueran,

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,400
we are not the same.

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,760
How are we not the same?

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
I was adopted.

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm not worthy of you.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
Chengxuan, what are you talking about?

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Chengxuan.

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,720
You got me.

78
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
With me, you'll be the same.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,680
If you want me,

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
you can do it right now.

81
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Mr. Ji.

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,600
Get out.

83
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Lock the door.

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Yueran,

85
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I've said it.

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
We are not the same.

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,040
You wouldn't understand.

88
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,120
Hey!

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Why don't you live in your own house?

90
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,160
Why bother to live with me?

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm your fiance.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,080
Our contract
doesn't include living together.

93
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
Don't you like it?

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,720
This is the result

95
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,240
of your own arbitrary decision

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,640
to postpone the wedding by three months.

97
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll sleep on the bed.
You sleep on the sofa.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
Did you hear me?

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,120
How can a man and a woman
sleep in the same bed?

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm talking to you.

101
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,280
Are you pretending to be deaf?

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
Mr. Ji,

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,480
have you never been

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,960
in a relationship before?

105
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
I guess

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,120
no girl's ever taught you

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,680
how to treat a lady, right?

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,160
Mr. Ji,

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,240
do you really bear

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,280
to compete for a bed
with a poor girl like me?

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,960
You really need more practice.

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,120
Your performance is too bad.

113
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
No one can stop me.

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,160
Do you snore?

115
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
If you do, I'll wake you up.

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you sleepwalk?

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,880
If you lay a finger on me,
I'll call the police.

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,760
Turn off the lights.

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
I just knew she must be an imposter.

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
The bumpkin tried to deceive me.

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,120
Yes, so Xia Tian is not He Shanyue.

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Miss Shen, you believe me.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
It doesn't matter
whether I believe it or not.

124
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,440
You have to make
Mr. He believe she is an imposter.

125
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,400
There are plenty of ways
to prove Xia Tian's identity.

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,120
But if I help you,

127
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,160
what are my benefits?

128
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,360
I am the rightful heiress
to the Jiuzhou Group.

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
If you help me get rid of
that stepping stone,

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
you needn't worry about the benefits.

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
Alright.

132
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,080
As long as you do as I say,

133
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,360
I guarantee she will be exposed.

134
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,400
Do you like it,

135
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,600
Xia Tian?

136
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,600
Your cover is blown.

137
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,480
Good morning.

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,800
Don't talk to me.

139
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
What are you doing?

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
I told you not to talk to me.

141
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Hello.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,720
Xia Tian.

143
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,400
You got the wrong person.

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
Drop the act.

145
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
You can deny being Xia Tian,

146
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,680
but what about your grandma?

147
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
Shen Yueran, what do you mean?

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,880
What have you done to my grandma?

149
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,120
Admit to Grandpa
that you are an imposter.

150
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,600
Otherwise, you will never see
your grandma again.

151
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,320
Shen Yueran, I'm warning you...

152
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,720
What's going on?

153
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,160
Shen Yueran has hidden my grandma away.

154
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,240
Hello, Shen Yueran.

155
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm going to tell Grandpa.

156
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,400
Here you are.

157
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,600
Shan, you're back.

158
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,600
You look so awful. What's wrong?

159
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,680
Don't you have something very important

160
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
to tell Grandpa?

161
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Come on, say it.

162
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,480
Grandpa,

163
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,680
Actually, I was raised
by my grandmother.

165
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,480
I am not your granddaughter.

166
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
I lied to you.

167
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,920
I'll pack up and leave right away.

168
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,880
Shan.

169
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
Shan,

170
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
you're totally welcome here.

171
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Although you haven't been around us,

172
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,920
Grandpa has always been thinking of you.

173
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
He considers you the closest person.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
What on earth is going on?

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Grandpa,

176
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,560
Chengxuan,

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,960
you all have been deceived by her.

178
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
She is not He Shanyue.

179
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,120
She is just an unknown actress.

180
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,200
Tell Grandpa now.

181
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,120
Tell him that you used her grandmother
to threaten her into lying.

182
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,920
Or tell him that

183
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,880
Grandpa has long known
that she was raised by her grandmother

184
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
and has been an actress for years

185
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,320
to pay for
her grandmother's medical bills?

186
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,400
What are you talking about?

187
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
Right.

188
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920

Grandpa.
