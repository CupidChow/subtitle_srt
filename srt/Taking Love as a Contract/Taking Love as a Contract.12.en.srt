Being with you for a long time

of the little things.

No.

no reaction whatsoever?)

00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,160
(Last time she was so angry.)

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,480
(I can't afford to misconstrue
her meaning again.)

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360

If not, would you like to go
to Changshou Village with me?

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
There's a restaurant there
I've always wanted to visit.

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Alright.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,800
You've done a good job
with the Changshou Village case.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,800
I think it's ready to be launched now.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,120
Grandpa,

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,400
here's a document. Please take a look.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
Let's talk about it later.

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,080
No, Grandpa.

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,160
It concerns your family's bloodline.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
You have to take a look now.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
I must say,

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
your performance was convincing.

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
I was almost fooled by you.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
But what's fake is fake.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Yueran, what are you talking about?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
I don't understand.

59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,960
Still acting.

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
Grandpa,

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,400
Chengxuan,

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,600
shareholders,

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,440
this person...

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,280
Yueran.

65
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,200
She is not Grandpa's grandchild at all.

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
Don't be ridiculous.

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,280
Grandpa,

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,960
you've been kept in the dark all along.

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,880
I have got a DNA report.

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,880
It was on your birthday.

71
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
I had your blood sample

72
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
and compared it with hers.

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,600
The results were very reliable.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,840
How does it feel?

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,280
When pretending to be He Shanyue,

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
did you ever think
there would be such a day?

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,160
Our agency compared
and analyzed the blood samples

78
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,000
of He Zhou and He Shanyue.

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,360
The DNA sequences of the two individuals
were found to be similar.

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,840
There is a 99.9% probability
of a familial relationship

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
between the two individuals.

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,520
Grandpa, this isn't true.

83
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,800
Enough, Yueran.

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,680
Sorry about this.

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
Yueran,

86
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,240
thanks for proving to everyone

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,080
that Shan is my biological granddaughter

88
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,840
to save us from rumors.

89
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
You've been working hard lately,

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,360
so,

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
put your work on hold for now

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,760
and take a rest.

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Grandpa.

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,840
Go out and clear your mind.

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,400
Miss Shen.

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Please.

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,080
Miss Shen.

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
Chengxuan,

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,400
hand over the Changshou Village project

100
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
to Qin Yue for now.

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,280
Grandpa,

102
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,520
I've been overseeing it

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
for almost a year.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,320
I know.

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
That project

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,000
is currently our most valued project.

107
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,600
Qin Yue has
more experience in that area.

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
It would be more sensible
to let him carry it out.

109
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,800
That's it. Dismissed.

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,200
What's going on?

111
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,720
It should be cow's blood on the tissue.

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,600
How could it show
that Grandpa and I are related?

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,800
And you know

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,160
I am my grandmother's blood.

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,280
What's going on?

116
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,080
Chengxuan.

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,200
Shan, you can go back.

118
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,480
I've got things to do.

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
(How can I call her Shan?)

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
Get back to your work.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
But don't forget about our date tonight.

122
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,920
I won't.

123
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,480
Why did I mention "date"?

124
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:39,424
(Ji Chengxuan, General Manager)

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I came for the project materials.

126
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,480
I haven't sorted them out yet.

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
I'll have Jian Ze deliver
them to you in a bit.

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
So you like reading history?

129
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Using history as a mirror,

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,200
one can understand the ups and downs.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
I like it too.

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
But I later realized
that no matter how much I read

133
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
or find lessons to learn,

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,640
it's impossible to predict things
like what happened today.

135
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,800
Such things have already happened

136
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,720
many times in history.

137
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,600
Xiang Yu was unparalleled in valor,
a one-of-a-kind through the ages.

138
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Yet regrettably,

139
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,720
he lost everything
to a petty man like Liu Bang.

140
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,400
Since you like Xiang Yu so much,

141
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
you must know

142
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,480
that he was set in his ways
and naturally suspicious.

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
He wasn't supported.

144
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Han Xin could only be a foot soldier
under his command,

145
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,480
but he became a general under Liu Bang.

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,160
So choice is more important
than effort, right?

147
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,400
Look at you, acting all high and mighty.

148
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,680
Just lucky for now.

149
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,880
Whatever you say.

150
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,320
But let's see who's the winner.

151
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Some people are born in high society,

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,040
while some people

153
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,920
have to scheme to become a son-in-law.

154
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
What do you mean?

155
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,444
(Records of the Grand Historian)
Using history as a mirror,

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
one can understand the ups and downs.

157
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,320
Don't forget to have Jian Ze
deliver the materials

158
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,880
to me later.

159
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,720
Hello, Grandma, what's wrong?

160
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,600
Xia Tian,

161
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,440
you aren't coming around

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,240
to see me as much lately.

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,680
Now you aren't gonna call me

164
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
unless I call you first?

165
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,760
Grandma, sorry.

166
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,440
I will visit you tomorrow.

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,720
I know you're busy making money.

168
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,720
But recently I keep having dreams,

169
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
dreaming that I was in the old house

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
making wontons for your parents.

171
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
I also dreamt of those flowers

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
withering.

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,960
Grandma, dreams
don't come true. Don't worry.

174
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,880
Grandma, I've got something
to do right now.

175
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,920
I'll get back to it

176
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,280
and call you back later.

177
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,160
Sorry.

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,320
Have you been waiting long?

179
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,960
No.

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Didn't you order?

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm not hungry yet.

182
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,160
Chengxuan.

183
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,280
Excuse me.

184
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
This

185
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,360
and this one.

186
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Be quick.

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Okay.

188
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,760
Are you hungry?

189
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes.

190
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,840
There is still lots of work

191
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
to do.

192
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,400
Then long story short.

193
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
I've been thinking a lot
these past few days.

194
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,800
I...

195
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,920
Sir, I'm sorry.

196
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
We've sold out of this dish today.

197
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
So...?

198
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,880
Then this one.

199
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,520
Okay.

200
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,880
I thought a lot last night.

201
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,600
I...

202
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,960
You...

203
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,120
Actually...

204
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Sir,

205
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,880
this is complimentary pre-meal bread.

206
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,520
Thank you.

207
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,000
You got it.

208
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,120
It's okay.

209
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,120
We have plenty of time to talk.

210
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
Actually, I wanted to say

211
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,280
I've really been thinking a lot lately.

212
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,880
I think we...

213
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,480
(Shen Yueran)

214
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Put it down.

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,400
I hang it up, okay?

216
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,776
(Shen Yueran)

217
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
Fine, answer it.

218
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
Really?

219
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,520
Yeah.

220
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,240
Hello.

221
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,160
No need to call the police.

222
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,120
Hold her off for now.

223
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll be right there.

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,520
