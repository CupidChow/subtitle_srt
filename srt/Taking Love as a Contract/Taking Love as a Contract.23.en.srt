(I did well in my act, didn't I?)

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
Hope we have a pleasant cooperation.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,000
Of course. Let's sign the contract.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,800
Shen Yueran.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
Who do you think you are
to represent Jiuzhou Group?

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
You conspired to deceive me.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,500
You were the one
to act unrighteously first.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,960
We were just going along with your act.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I originally thought

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,960
he truly betrayed me.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,360
Our cooperation is over

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
starting from now.

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,000
(I didn't expect
to learn about his plan later on.)

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
(Shen Yueran wants
to sell off the He's Group.)

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,240
(The engagement banquet
was to stall her.)

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,960
(Here is my plan.)

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Our scandal
is all over the Internet now.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
The stock price has halved
and you still want to sell?

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,480
I told Mr. Qin

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,840
you want to manipulate the stock price
with the engagement banquet.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,320
(He promised me)

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,440
(he would come forward for me)

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,920
(and persuade other shareholders.)

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Everything is ready,

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,080
just waiting for a grand show with you.

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,440
Especially that slap of yours,

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,040
I can still feel the pain.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,920
You played the role
of a postmodern woman

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,760
resisting her class destiny

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
to the fullest.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
I really should award you

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,800
the Best Actress award.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
You're not bad yourself, Mr. Ji.

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
Under my influence,

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,480
some genuine emotions were displayed.

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
But when it comes to hitting a scumbag,

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,720
you've got to be able to strike hard.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,080
Was that dream even real?

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
I'll settle accounts with you later.

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
Please listen to my explanation,
they are...

51
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,040
Qin Yue.

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,880
I just do not want

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
anyone to harm the company's interests.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Shen Yueran.

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
All of this is the consequence
of your own doing.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
You reap what you sow.

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,160
I, on behalf of the largest shareholder
of Jiuzhou Group,

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
officially notify you

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,600
that you have been fired.

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,840
You have no qualifications
to sign any contracts.

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Xia Tian, who do you think you are?

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,640
You...

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Enough, Shen Yueran.

64
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,040
Stop it.

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,280
Don't even think about it.

66
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
Grandpa clearly stated in his will

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,960
that everything of He family is mine.

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,160
It's all mine.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Mr. Ji, Miss He.

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,440
The butler said Mr. He is awake.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
Shen Yueran,

72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
your solo act is over.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Grandpa.

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
Grandpa, you're awake.

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
Good girl.

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,680
I know it all.

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
You've worked hard.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,040
Chengxuan,

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,280
it seems I am really old.

80
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,200
I discovered

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
I was so stubborn.

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,400
Compared with a truly caring person,

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
blood relation

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
doesn't seem so important after all.

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
The breeze feels quite nice.

86
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,120
Grandpa is awake.

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,160
How nice.

88
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,080
Now everything is settled.

89
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
Can I take a break for a while?

90
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
What do you want to do?

91
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,240
I want

92
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,640
to apply for a leave.

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
Then I have to consider it.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
You need to consider it?

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Mr. Ji.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,960
I want to go out and play.

97
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I want to eat something nice.

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Something nice?

99
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,200
The chef at home
is a French Cordon Bleu.

100
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,520
You can eat whatever you want.

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
What about going out to play?

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,960
We can find such a small lake

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
without anyone

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
disturbing us.

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,640
Then we can rent a small boat.

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,280
Every day, you'll be the captain
and I'll be your sailor.

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,960
How comfortable it will be
to float around in the lake.

109
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,040
Right.

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360

in the lake

116

Why?

126
