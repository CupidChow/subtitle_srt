(Do you think you know him well?)

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,200
Alright.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
We've been on the phone
for an hour. Aren't you tired?

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,960
Keep talking,
and your kettle might boil dry.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,320
I've arrived.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,320
Once you're ready, come over.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,680
Bye.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,040
Mr. Ji,

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,120
why couldn't I get in touch with you?

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,600
What's wrong?

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,920
Mr. He had a sudden heart attack
and was taken to the hospital.

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,400
Let's go.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,200
The doctor said

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,800
his health

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,080
wasn't great.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,680
He might have had a shock.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Ms. Wang,

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,520
once everyone is here,

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,160
you can start reading the will.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,280
Yes.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,880
What's going on? What will?

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,160
Why the sudden need
to announce the will?

33
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,760
No idea.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
Grandpa had a stroke last night.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,520
Grandpa is just temporarily unconscious.

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,880
He will wake up soon.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,120
But you.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,080
What's the rush to announce the will?

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm just following

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Grandpa's orders.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,040
Shen Yueran,

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
as soon as you left,
Grandpa had a stroke.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
What on earth did you do to him?

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,920
Grandpa was fine when I left.

45
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
Look at you.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,000
You are not Grandpa's blood,

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,520
yet you get all angry and anxious
when Grandpa has a stroke.

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,000
You couldn't be the one
who caused Grandpa's stroke

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
and now is playing
the victim, could you?

50
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,520
You're turning this around on me?

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,880
Xia Tian wanted to say,

52
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,720
isn't that a bit inappropriate
for you to read the will

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
as soon as Grandpa falls unconscious?

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,240
Grandpa is getting old,

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,400
and his health isn't very good.

56
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,200
He made a will in advance

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,840
just to prevent the company

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
from being rudderless.

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
What's wrong with having the heiress

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,760
named in the will

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
take charge of the company?

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
Ms. Wang, read the will.

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,080
Okay.

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,280
Testator's name: He Zhou.

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,480
Date of signing: September 6, 2020.

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,040
Put this over there.

67
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,480
No, I'll go talk to her.

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
Don't stop me.

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,800
By will,

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
she is now the acting chairperson.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,120
That will must be forged.

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Let's get a lawyer to verify it.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,440
I have seen that will.

74
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
You have seen it?

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,480
Grandpa drafted that will

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
in front of us all.

77
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Come in.

78
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,120
Miss Shen, you need me?

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,720
Ms. Wang, shouldn't you
change how you address me?

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,520
Chairman Shen,

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
there's something.

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,840
Last night, Mr. He suddenly called me

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
and asked me to come,

84
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,320
saying he wanted to change the will.

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,440
But I hadn't seen Mr. He yet

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
when the news came out
that he had a stroke.

87
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Ms. Wang,

88
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,760
only my grandpa and I

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,880
share the same blood.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,120
You are

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,640
just someone working for our family.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,080
So you should know

93
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,600
what should be said

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,080
and what should not be said.

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
What does it mean?

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,280
Does this trash deserve to stay here?

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
I need to throw them away.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Grandpa is still in the hospital.

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm cleaning the house for Grandpa.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
He would surely be happy to know.

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,120
What right do you have
to do it for Grandpa?

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,720
What right?

103
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
Grandpa has left everything to me.

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,040
You were feeling pretty smug before,

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
but now you have nothing, don't you?

106
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,400
Shen Yueran,

107
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,600
heavens are watching.

108
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,720
I don't care
how ruthless you've been to me.

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Grandpa loves you so much.

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,640
Ji Chengxuan,

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,160
if I call the police now,

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,400
you would be intruding into
a private residence.

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,880
Let me tell you.

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
The house, the car
and the company are all mine.

116
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,440
Miss Shen,

117
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,280
don't get too smug.

118
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,760
Once Grandpa wakes up,
the truth will come out.

119
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
Chengxuan,

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,080
Grandpa has been treating you
as his own grandson.

121
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,440
Grandpa personally chose the best

122
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,920
for your every need.

123
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,320
Now he's seriously ill.

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
Are you really going

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,400
to abandon him

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,120
for an outsider?

127
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
Miss Shen,

128
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,240
you're really skilled
at manipulating people.

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,520
But do you think
Chengxuan will fall for it?

130
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,440
Xia Tian,

131
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
how long have you known Ji Chengxuan?

132
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
Do you really know him?

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Some people

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,440
can stand by each other
after only three days of acquaintance.

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,800
Some people, even after a lifetime,

136
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
remain strangers.

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,960
Is that so?

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
Do you know the total market value

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,400
of the company?

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,760
It's two billion.

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,240
And you.

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,840
Do you even comprehend
how much two billion is?

143
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,400
Ji Chengxuan,

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,080
you've put in so much effort
for the family assets.

145
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
Are you really going

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
to let it all go to waste?

147
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,840
Did you forget why you had her pretend

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,160
to be He Shanyue?

149
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,920
I can pass over
what happened in the past.

150
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I'll also turn a blind eye
to you selling shares

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,880
to buy back her house.

152
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,920
Now I'm giving you two choices.

153
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,920
One is to leave with this actress

154
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
without a penny to your name.

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,320
The other one is to stay with me

156
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,120
and enjoy our family's wealth.

157
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
Choose for yourself.

158
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
What right do you have to...

159
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,720
Shut up!

160
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Do you know how much two billion is?

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,080
Why is there so much nonsense?

162
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,280
You bumpkin.

163
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,840
Shen Yueran, haven't you had...

164
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Xia Tian,

165
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
you better leave.

166
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,040
What did you say?

167
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,440
Starting from now,

168
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,080
our cooperation

169
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
is over.

170
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,400
Look at me.

Do you remember what I told you before?

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
For me,

183
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,400
love accounts for at most ten percent.

184
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
Even if we are together,

185
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,720
you're just that ten percent.

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Okay.

187
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
