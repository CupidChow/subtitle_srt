(I thought things were different)

12
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
Why did you kiss me?

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,320
And where were your hands going?

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,760
I... It's... I thought...

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,800
I was gonna thank you,

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,440
but now, forget it.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm sorry,

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,600
Xia Tian.

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Sorry,

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,120
I got the wrong idea.

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,720
You just go ahead and do things

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,080
without thinking, big ego.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,320
You lied about the engagement.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,840
And today, you dragged me

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,320
to a cheap place

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,920
to save my money,

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,080
saying it's like a TV show.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,080
And now, you think

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,280
you can just

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,360
do anything you want with me,

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
huh?

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,840
Ever think about what I want?

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,840
I thought...

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,080
What?

35
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,720
Thought we were different now.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,120
That things had changed.

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,040
Fine,

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,160
I might have a thing for you.

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,080
But does that mean I have to

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,440
be stuck with you?

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Compared to these,

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,960
what really bugs me is

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,280
that you treat me like a puppet,

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,920
which only goes along with your script

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,200
without any thoughts of my own.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,360
Get lost.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,880
Where is Miss He?

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,400
She has taken a day off.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,200
A day off?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,272
(Finished your work? Reply me.)

Jian Ze,

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
I have a task for you.

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
Sorry,

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
I put that CD in there.

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
Mr. Qin.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
So you skipped work today?

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm on leave.

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Excuse me.

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
Sorry about work earlier.

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,320
It's...

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,960
It's okay.

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
Let's keep things real.

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,720
This is a totally chill spot.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
Since we're in a CD store,

65
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
we should talk about music.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,360
I always draw the line
between work and life.

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
Maybe I should do the same

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,760
with him.

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,680
We're just

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,440
colleagues in the end.

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,320
Pardon me?

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,200
Nothing.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,600
Every time I see you,

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,040
it's like you drop some wisdom on me.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,640
You like this one?

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Ladies first.

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
How about letting me
check out your music taste?

78
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
Are you sure?

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
Yes, please.

80
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,000
(Didn't know)

81
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,440
(she got a sweet side of her.)

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,720
Alright, Mr. Ji.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
(Business advantages of Changshou Village project)
This plan here is the best version so far.

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,960
We fixed the cost and trimmed down

85
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,920
the production time compared to

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,000
the other two options.

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm thinking...

88
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,440
Sounds good.

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's take a break.

90
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,760
We're done for today.

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Cool.

92
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:10,464
(Outpatient Building)

93
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000
I got the test result

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
for Xia Tian and her grandma.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,280
Playing those lame songs on my speakers

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
is like throwing pearls to swine.

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,880
You have zero taste in music.

98
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,640
You call some outdated CD good taste?

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,480
It's niche, okay? You wouldn't get it.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Niche, huh?

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
Why did you think
you could skip work for CD shops?

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
That's my free time.

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,760
It's none of your business.

104
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,120
Your job is being He Shanyue.

105
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,920
Tomorrow is Grandpa's birthday,

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,040
and you're thinking of

107
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,920
giving him this ancient CD?

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,960
Grandpa's getting a cool gift.

109
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
Give my CD back, alright?

110
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Ji Chengxuan.

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,680
It's mine.

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,400
It's on you this time.

113
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,080
I didn't even touch you.

114
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,160
Just give it to me.

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Fine. Keep it.

116
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
What a piece of work.

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,160
Dissing my CD

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,160

Whatever,

it's just business.

121
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
