(Do you hate kisses or me?)

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,160
Where's the bag?

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,480
Where is it?

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,080
It's here.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,240
Still here.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,640
I didn't break it, right?

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
It's worth 100,000.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,520
What are you doing?

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,440
I said you shouldn't throw things away.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,920
It pollutes the environment.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,680
Besides, it would be very bad
if it hit a child.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,160
If I remember correctly,

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,080
you were the one
who threw the bag, right?

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,920
So what if I did?

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,160
I know my fault and will make amends.

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,080
Protecting the environment
is everyone's duty.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,320
This bag plus the balance on my card

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
should be enough.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
Although it's second-hand,

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
it's still quite new.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,840
Want some bread?

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Who's going to sell the bag? I am not.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,600
No,

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,280
thanks.

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,280
The sun is nice today.

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm going out.

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
(Let me see)

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
(what your sneaky behavior)

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,480
(with the bag is for.)

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
Sir,

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
could you tell me
how much I can get for this bag?

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,480
This bag.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,440
You've been carrying this bag
for quite some time, haven't you?

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,040
I just bought it yesterday.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,480
Look, the receipt.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,160
The writing on it is hard to read.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,960
Look at these scratches.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,160
Clear and distinct.

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,200
I'd say,

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
at most 50,000, not a penny more.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,920
You're offering 50,000
for this 100,000-yuan bag?

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,000
I haven't used it at all.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
That is your business.

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
I assess the goods.

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,640
So my innocence

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
is only worth 50,000 yuan.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,280
Forget it.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,040
I am just an ordinary person.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,920
I'll take the money and bear this loss.

60
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Girl, don't pretend to be above it all.

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,520
50,000 is already a high price for you.

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
What do you mean?

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm not selling the bag.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,240
60,000.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
At most 60,000.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Girl,

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,280
it's the casting couch, right?

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,640
Mind your tongue.

69
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
I just

70
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
met a rogue.

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,640
I signed an unfair treaty with him

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,760
and became his assistant for 24 hours.

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,960
And then,

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
he couldn't resist.

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,520
Right?

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Worse than animals.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
One night.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,200
But I only

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,400
got such a lousy bag in return.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
Worth only 60,000 yuan.

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,720
Not a single good thing about men.

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,760
You're even cursing yourself?

83
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,120
Call me lady.

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,360
Lady, I am a woman now.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Your first time?

86
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,080
You're right.

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,680
80,000.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,440
Just consider it a favor.

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,160
Lady, you are too kind.

90
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
So, WeChat or Alipay?

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,200
Why are you here?

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
When you were fabricating
stories inside,

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
you were quite sharp.

94
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
Impossible.

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,080
How do you know?

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,120
Why am I being called an animal?

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,840
What does this mean?

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Hyperbole.

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,440
How do you know it's hyperbole?

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,680
You eavesdropped on me.

101
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,200
That's shady.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,160
Wearing sunglasses on a rainy day.

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,720
You're the shady one.

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,960
And to you,

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
I'm just a rogue?

106
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,320
Yes.

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,680
I did make up a story.

108
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Wasn't it all just

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,000
to sell your bag at a better price?

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
So you don't like that bag

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,000
because you think it's not expensive

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,080
and can't sell at a high price?

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
You should have said it earlier.

114
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,600
Our kissing scenes have a fixed price.

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,240
Get off me.

116
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,120
I hate kissing the most.

117
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,240
Do you hate kisses or me?

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
I hate you the most.

119
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,240
You hate me because I don't give
you enough money, right?

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,200
Okay.

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
I will pay you more.

122
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
10,000 more.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,880
Is it enough?

124
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,080
30,000.

125
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,280
50,000.

126
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
I want you

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,840
to perform one right now.

128
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,440
Fine.

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
If you like it, come on.

130
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Anyway, I'm all about the money.

131
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,040
You'd better transfer
the money to me right now.

132
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,240
Come on.

133
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,480
Thank you.

134
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,400
You bought so many things.

135
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,400
Are you tired?
Do you want me to carry them?

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,960
I don't want to see you now.

137
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,960
Get lost!

138
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,520
Baby,

139
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,440
I know you're shy.

140
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
That's okay.

141
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,400
I can go through hardship

142
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,400
to meet your needs,

143
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,680
as long as you pay a little bit...

144
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,760
I pay? You wish!

145
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,040
Zou Bo,

146
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,120
take a look at yourself.

147
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Dream on.

148
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
Thank God I had an ace up my sleeve.

149
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,880
You,

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,640
it's go time.

151

(Jiuzhou Group's Infighting. He Shanyue
Exposed Shen Yueran's Private Photo)

152
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,400
Is it true?

153
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,360
Yeah, it's all over the Internet.

154
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,160
You sure it's not fake?

155
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,400
It's not. Everyone's talking about it.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,440
It must be true.

Xia Tian.

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,640
Shen Yueran, are you mad?

159
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Did you do this?

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Did you?

161
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,200
I sympathize with you
for meeting a scoundrel,

162
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,800
but what does that have to do with me?

163
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Still talking back? I must tear you...

164
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,920
Yueran, stop messing around.

165
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,280
What are you doing, Chengxuan?
You're still protecting her?

166
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,880
You have no idea what she's done.

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
I said I didn't do it.

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,120
Still talking back? Today, I...

169
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,640
Chengxuan.

170
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Chengxuan,

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,280
she's so scary.

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm really scared.

174
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,400
Miss Shen, let's go out.

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,600
Don't touch me.

176
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
Chengxuan.

177
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,720
Don't touch me!

178
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,120
Xia Tian, you think your acting

179
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
can make you the real heiress?

180
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,280
You played dirty.

181
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm telling you,
you'll get your comeuppance!

182
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
I haven't played any dirty tricks.

183
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,400
I believe you.

184
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,600
What was she talking about?
An imposter and tricks?

185
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,280
Miss Shen must be
too jealous of Miss He.

186
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
Look over there.
