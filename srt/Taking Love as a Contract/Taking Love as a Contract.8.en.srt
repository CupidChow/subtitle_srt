This is my room.

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
Then how did I end up here?

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,480
Maybe you have a thing for me,

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,720
and sneaked in?

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,640
You wish.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
Let me give you more details.

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
Last night, you…

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,840
Prepping for
Laba Festival dishes, Mrs. Yang?

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah.

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,120
Take a break.
I'll do the washing for you.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,520
Perfect. I need that.

58
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,480
Nice to have some help.

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
So much of it.

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
It will be more than enough.

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,640
May I join?

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't you want to know if you…

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,680
If I what?

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,840
Snored last night?

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
No, thanks.

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,800
What are you doing?

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
It's rainbow.

68
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
Like it?

69
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,640
It's alright.

70
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,160
Don't worry.

71
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Nothing happened last night.

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,640
However,

73
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,360
I've recorded funny videos of someone

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
sleeping weirdly.

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,160
Ji Chengxuan.

76
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,120
What's wrong with you?

77
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,680
Give me the phone now.

78
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,120
No.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,160
Come on.

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,600
Never.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
You better delete it.

82
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,520
No way.

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,240
It's not fair.

84
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm not in the mood.

85
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,200
I'll soak you.

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Just delete it, okay?

87
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
That's the story.

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,720
There's this old lady,

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
all alone,

90
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,200
looking after the house

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,960
her late husband built,

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,840
only with memories left.

93
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
She just can't let it go.

94
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
And then there's you,

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,520
the cold-hearted business person,

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,640
trying to take away people's lives

97
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,800
with a tough demolition plan,

98
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,320
stripping away someone else's memories

99
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,400
for 20% above market price.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
Either change her situation

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,320
or change your mind.

102
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,280
You don't have to do that.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
I can change the proposal.

104
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,880
Do you mean…?

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
Did you know all along

106
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
that Mrs. Yang didn't want to move

107
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
because she wanted to
keep the memories with Mr. Yang?

108
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
I've done my research.

109
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,520
I'm wondering,

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,920
does anyone

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,720
still have a lifelong love

112
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
like Mrs. Yang's these days?

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
When I was a kid,

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,200
I dreamt of being a captain,

115
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,640
steering my own ship

116
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,960
on an adventure.

117
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,880
Now, I just want to
inherit the family business

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
and take charge of He's Group.

119
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,840
Making fighting for family inheritance
your life goal?

120
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Seriously?

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
He's Group's situation

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,360
is way more complicated than you think.

123
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I get it.

124
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,040
Anyway,

125
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,920
love isn't
part of your life plan, right?

126
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
Maybe 10%, tops.

127
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,600
Aren't you the same?

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
True.

129
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,400
I've got to take care of my grandma,

130
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,040
and buy back our ancestral house.

131
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
No time for love.

132
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,760
It's like 5%

133
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,760
for me.

134
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,640
