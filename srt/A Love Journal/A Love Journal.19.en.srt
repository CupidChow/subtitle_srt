2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,880
Gu Shen.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,480
So you were not

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,119
unwilling to go home with me?

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,679
It was all because of this?

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,000
Gu Shen.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,719
I'm still alive.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,760
My only best friend

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,359
is gone now.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,960
Sui.

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,759
You look so pretty today.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,359
I'll go to the kitchen

13
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,399
to get you some food.

14
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,000
Sir.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,359
You didn't steal the designs.

16
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,640
Why did you admit it?

17
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,000
It's the same.

18
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,599
I'm a bad woman anyway.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,239
I didn't peek at the designs,

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,239
but I peeked at your bidding proposal.

21
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,239
That was not the real one.

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,040
Smart,

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,239
clever.

24
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,640
Are you done showing off?

25
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,719
Do you have to talk like this?

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,040
Do you have to tell me I'm stupid
and did something humiliating?

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,959
That's not what I meant.

28
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,959
I apologize for what I did to you

29
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,239
before.

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,200
No need.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
We shall not see each other again.

32
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,959
Zi Zhen.

33
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,079
Don't be moody, okay?

34
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,959
I'm moody?

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,240
Fine.

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm moody.

37
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,319
Ji Chuan.

38
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,479
From now on,

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,960
don't appear in front of me again.

40
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,560
I've figured it out.

41
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,199
It was Manager Sun,
who worked for Canxiang before.

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,639
She has been in touch with Mrs. Huang.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
She stole

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,080
the designs

45
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,639
while we were away.

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,719
We didn't do enough protection.

47
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,280
It's really hard

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
to avoid an inside job like this.

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,919
This won't work out.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,080
So,

51
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,759
I've thought of a way.
