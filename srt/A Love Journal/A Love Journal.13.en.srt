2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,519
You are an interesting couple.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,080
How independent,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,519
self-reliant,

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,160
and smart you are.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,399
No wonder even a man like Gu Shen

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,600
is mesmerized by you,

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,960
our best saleswoman.

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,679
What exactly do you want to say?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,799
You know exactly

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,359
what Zi Zhen is going to do.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm just thinking,

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,600
you are so close to him,

14
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,280
so why don't I entrust this task

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
to you?

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Thanks for having dinner

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
with me and my mom today.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,600
Sui.

19
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,600
What's wrong?

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,759
You seem troubled.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,479
Nothing.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,320
I have some work to do.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,479
You can go to rest first.

24
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,799
You are very close to Gu Shen, right?

25
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,719
Yeah, it's been like this since college.

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,920
He

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,280
has a long face,

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
but he's

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,959
very sensitive.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,840
Really?

31
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,480
Yeah.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,120
Then did you have
a relationship or something

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,480
when you were in college?

34
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,120
I had a crush

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,439
on a girl back then.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,680
I didn't want her to feel pressured

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,799
because of my identity,

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,879
and I didn't want girls to be with me

39
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,200
for money.

40
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,159
And then we got together.

41
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,040
I wanted to tell her my identity

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,519
when I graduated.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
But...

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
But what?

45
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,439
She was dating a rich boy
from another class,

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,919
but I didn't know anything about it.

47
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,120
She told me

48
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,960
she wanted a stable life.

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,719
I think she was right.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Then

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
what kind of life do you want?

52
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,319
Simple

53
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,479
and down-to-earth.

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
As long as we have
each other in our hearts,

55
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,080
that's enough.

56
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,639
Then

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
what kind of girl

58
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,439
do you think I am?

59
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,319
You?

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,800
Pretty,

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,919
gentle,

62
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,400
and most importantly,

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
you value relationships.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,520
Then do you like me?

65
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,599
I...

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,000
Tell me.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,879
Do you like me?

68
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,960
Let's play a game.
