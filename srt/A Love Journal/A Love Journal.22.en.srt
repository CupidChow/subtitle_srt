How dare you touch my girl.

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,719
Gu Shen.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,960
I...

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,079
I didn't protect you.

7
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,000
Actually,

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,399
I can do it myself.

9
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,359
I wasn't there for you,

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,840
but I'll be here for you.

Zi Zhen.

Send last month's quarterly report
to my office.

18
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,319
What exactly are you going to do?

19
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,719
Nothing.

20
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,159
How many times have you called me today?

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Just job requirements.

22

Job requirements?

24
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,000
You are the special assistant
to the president of Liujin.

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
I am the deputy director of Canxiang.

26
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,400
Is there any overlap between our work?

27
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,719
You meant to do that.

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,719
I'm the special assistant
to the president.

29
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,360
Canxiang has just been acquired.

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
You're unfamiliar with Liujin's work.

31
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,439
I have to work hard here
