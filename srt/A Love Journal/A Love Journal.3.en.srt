We're here to provide planning services
for the client here.

(Go on. Go on.)

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,039
What a coincidence

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,920
to meet you two here.

00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,839
(Go on. Go on.)

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,679
Well...

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,879
Your company

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,199
is here too?

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,679
(What question is that?)

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,640
Why are you ignoring me?

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,240
Well.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,240
We didn't say anything.

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,399
What are you trying to explain?

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:44,960
I...

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,439
You...

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,600
Are you going home for dinner tonight?

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,719
Yeah.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,079
Let's go.

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,400
What are you doing?

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,159
My mom is here.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,079
Mom.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You are my daughter-in-law, Ning Sui.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,319
What brings you here?

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,719
Let me take a good look at you.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,000
Your...

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
Why is your face so red?

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,680
My mother suspects
that our marriage is a sham.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,640
What do we do?

31
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,680
Let's play a show.

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,719
Don't move.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,319
I...

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,120
Mom.

35
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,959
You're here at an inappropriate time.

36
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,079
You should be temperate.

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Don't tire out my daughter-in-law.

38
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,640
Come here, Sui.

39
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,920
Let's have a chat.

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,239
Here.

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,879
Sit.

42
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,159
Sui.

43
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,840
How did you meet?

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,760
We are...

45
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,640
She was my classmate
back in high school.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah.

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,120
You have known
each other since high school?

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,719
Yes.

49
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,240
How long have you been together?

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,000
- Half a year.
- A year.

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,199
Mom.

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
She means

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,599
we've been together officially
for half a year.

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,159
She was pursuing me
in the first half of the year.

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,840
Yes.

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,639
Mom.

57
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
That's right.

58
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Gu Shen.

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,159
You've been together for so long,

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,120
but I didn't know it.

61
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,840
I should care more about you.

62
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,919
Gu Shen.

63
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,879
Why don't you
take Ning Sui out on honeymoon

64
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,400
and have a honeymoon baby by the way?

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,159
- Okay.
- No.

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,360
Mom.

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,599
You've brought
nourishment for Ning Sui, right?

68
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,120
Oh!

69
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,360
It's still on the stove.

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,439
You've been cleaning up
behind me all day long.

71
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,919
Do you have
obsessive compulsive disorder?

72
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,479
No, I don't.

73
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,800
I am just

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,639
bored.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,680
- Good night.
- Good night.
