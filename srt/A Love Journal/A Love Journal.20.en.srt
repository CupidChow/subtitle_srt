2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,320
That proposal was approved.

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,679
We missed you so much

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:11,640
while you were away.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,359
I missed you too.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,720
Isn't this Mrs. Gu?

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,719
Sorry, Mrs. Huang.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm back for work.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,600
What an honor.

10
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,640
We're honored to have Mrs. Gu here.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,760
Should I

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,199
prepare a red carpet for you?

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,519
I mean,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,439
we only have a small place

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,359
which is not big enough for you.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,640
Go to the personnel department

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,119
and get out of here.

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,679
You're the one
who should get out of here.

19
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,039
(Gu Shen.)

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,399
Why are you here?

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,159
My wife is being bullied.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,640
Shouldn't I get even for her?

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,239
Gu Shen.

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,680
What do you think this place is?

25
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,680
Here is Canxiang,

26
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,959
not Liujin.

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,879
Mrs. Huang.

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,400
Correction.

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,680
From now on,

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,680
it belongs to Gu.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
What do you mean?

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,079
This morning,

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,599
we completed
the acquisition of Canxiang.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,439
From now on,

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,159
this is a subsidiary of Liujin Group.

36
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,239
Acquisition?

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,359
You've acquired Canxiang?

38
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,680
How much would that cost?

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
That's not the point.

40
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,760
The point is you won't get wronged.

41
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,040
I don't believe it.

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,159
You can go to the administrative office

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
and ask them about it yourself.

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,120
By the way,

45
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,439
go to the personnel department.

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
You are fired.

47
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,640
You...

48
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,319
Fine.

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
We'll see.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,120
You'll be in charge of Canxiang.

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
How do I manage

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,799
such a big company?

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,280
You have Zi Zhen, don't you?

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,680
From now on,

55
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,800
you will be responsible

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,159
for all the affairs of Canxiang.

57
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,639
Why aren't you asleep?

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,800
Aren't you tired?

59
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,159
Yes.

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,039
But I don't want to sleep.

61
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,319
If you don't go to sleep,

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
I won't let you sleep.

63
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,520
Good morning.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Mr. Gu.

65
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,280
Good morning.

66
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,120
Mrs. Gu.
