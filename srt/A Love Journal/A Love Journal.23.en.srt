00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,199
What's going on?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,480
Who posted information

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,839
about Gu Shen's social phobia online?

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,599
The stock is down a few percent.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,240
I have inside information

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,719
that some of the suppliers
of Liujin are canceling orders.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,559
I don't know.

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,760
But now the priority is to find Gu Shen.

11
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,160
Did you get Ji Chuan?

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,600
He took a call and then ran out.

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,800
I didn't catch up with him,

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,679
and I can't get through to him now.

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,199
Maybe

16
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,559
he is trying to contact him, too

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,719
No.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,719
I have to go find him.

19
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,439
Where are you going?

20
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,240
Streets,

21
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,399
places where he goes often.

22
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,880
I have to find him wherever he is.

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Don't worry.

24
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,359
All we need to do now is
to believe in him.

25
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,159
It's no big deal for him.
