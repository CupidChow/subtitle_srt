You've got

a dirty mind.

31

Always talking nonsense.

Enough, enough.

Be serious.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,040
We need to maintain the relationship

with the clients of Mrs. Huang.

Okay.

42

No problem.

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,079
I'll meet the people of Yinrun.

44

But,

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,840
Mr. Lin

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,560
has a bad reputation.

47
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,079
Rest assured.

48
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,439
I've dealt with such people before.

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,200
I can do it.

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,159
Be careful.

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,480
I think

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,120
you're more dangerous.

53
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,639
You're young and promising, Mrs. Ning.

54
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,199
You're flattering me, Mr. Lin.

55
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,680
We must rely on you.

56
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm so happy to have
such a beautiful girl like you

57
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,599
having dinner with me.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,759
We will try our best to give you

59
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,599
what Mrs. Huang promised you before.

60
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,319
Really?

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,039
Anything I want?

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,599
Yes.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,120
As long as it is reasonable.

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
I think

65
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,280
they are all reasonable.

66
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,360
Mr. Lin.
