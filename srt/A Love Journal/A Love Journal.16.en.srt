Ji Chuan.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,000
Help me figure a way out.

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,559
Ning Sui told me again
to go to her home for dinner.

5
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,440
(How about)

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,200
(I go with you?)

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,799
We haven't seen each other
for a long time, Fei.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,679
(Mr. Gu.)

9
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,240
Do you want to grab dinner sometime?

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,759
I've got a new batch of wine.

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:39,600
(Sounds great.)

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,399
Men are really unreliable.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,679
Not now.

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,560
Even thinking about it

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,799
makes me feel scared now.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,079
(What about Ning Sui?)

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,479
(Even with her around?)

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,840
I don't know.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,200
(Well.)

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,280
(I'll think of a way for you.)

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,840
What are those?

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,000
Why did you put my cousin's face on it?

23
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,920
I'm going to your home with you,

24
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,079
so I'm trying to get used to it first.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,760
Just having a meal
and you have to rehearse?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,959
It shows how much I value you.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,319
Gu Shen.

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,480
Are you afraid of accompanying me home?

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,359
A little bit.

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,640
Take it easy.

31
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm here.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
You just need to enjoy your meal

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,280
and think of yourself as a mascot.

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,319
(How many people
are there in your family?)

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,599
(Where do you work?)

36
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,599
(How old are you?)

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,920
(What do your parents do?)

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,079
(Come on. Cheers.)

39
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,920
(Cheers.)

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
(Come on, boy. Don't be shy.)

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,560
Gu Shen.

42
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,959
Gu Shen.

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,799
Gu Shen.

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,840
Ning Sui.

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,599
Thank you.

46
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,159
Why?

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,120
You're weird.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
Have your breakfast.

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,560
I gotta go to the company early today.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,560
Ji Chuan.

51
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,080
I think it's time
to tell Ning Sui about it.

52
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,000
The doll treatment really works?

53
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,080
It's not that.

54
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,599
It's because I feel safe

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,479
when she's around.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,199
Good news, anyway.

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,639
I don't need to be
on call day and night.

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,039
What did you say?

59
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,680
I mean,

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
you should go out with her more often

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
to adapt to different environments.

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
It is helpful to you.

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,919
Okay?

64
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,639
I haven't come out
for a walk for a long time.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah.

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,319
Me neither.

67
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,360
You're so careless.

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Let me hold your hand.

69
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,479
Your mother

70
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,919
has got eyes around here too?

71
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,479
Yeah.
