2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,119
Sui.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,800
It's so quiet here.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,519
Do you remember

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,120
when we were in high school?

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,320
Yeah.

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,280
You were

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,640
a crazy girl back then.

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
I was not crazy.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,640
That's called youth.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,359
It was

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,880
an interesting period of time.

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,679
One-on-one tutoring.

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,200
How did the teacher come up with it?

15
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,280
Don't mention it.

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,159
You were so stupid back then.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,119
I had to spend two hours
every day tutoring you.

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,840
I was just trying to make you happy.

19
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,119
You always had a long face.

20
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,560
No one hung with you

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,000
except me.

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,280
You come to me today

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,439
just to reminisce about our youth?

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,079
People think about the past

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,240
when they are in a bad mood.

26
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,200
After you went abroad,

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,799
to be honest,

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,319
I missed you a lot.

29
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,599
No one

30
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,239
could make me that happy anymore.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,599
After I went to college,

32
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,239
there was a senior

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,599
who was very nice to me.

34
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,120
He brought me breakfast

35
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,560
every morning,

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,439
met me

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,920
after I finished classes,

38
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,760
and tried his best

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,760
to make me happy.

40
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,840
All the girls in the department

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
were envious of me.

42
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,239
I was going to agree to his request

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,079
for being my boyfriend on my birthday.

44
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,959
But on his way to take the cake to me,

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,239
he had an accident.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,840
Since then,

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,120
I never believed

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,319
that I would have

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,519
such a beautiful relationship again.

50
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,560
I've never thought about
being in a relationship

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
or had a crush on anyone since then.

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,800
I dated that bad guy

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,520
just to deal with my mom.

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,919
Gu Shen.

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,800
You are a good person

56
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,759
and is nice to me.

57
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,159
But our marriage

58
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,439
is just an agreement.

59
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,639
I have a question.

60
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,439
Don't ask.

61
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,960
I don't want my answer

62
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,360
to hurt you.

63
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,960
Gu Shen.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,319
I just want to ask,

65
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,080
what happened last night?

66
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,520
You don't remember?

67
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,680
I only remember

68
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,240
that I drank too much.

69
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,400
I don't remember anything after that.

70
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,400
(Did he do that)

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,240
(just on impulse?)

72
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,400
(A drunken behavior?)

73
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,759
(God!)

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
(I got trapped.)

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,680
(But my first kiss...)

76
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,159
Well...

77
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,879
I just read a serial story last night.

78
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,280
That's the latest content.

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,879
It's touching, isn't it?
