2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,080
You can't go with another man.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,560
Why can't I go with another man?

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,640
If your mom takes a video of us
and sends it to my mom,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,800
my mom will know it.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,039
I don't care.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
Anyway, you broke the agreement first.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,359
Fine.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,320
I'll go.

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,199
But you must let me
decide the time and place.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,839
It's my mom.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,640
What do we do?

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,719
Can't be this week.

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,079
Tell her I'm on a business trip.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,760
Then

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,840
you will not be the perfect son-in-law
in her eyes anymore.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,280
Or tell her you're on a business trip.

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,679
No, I won't.

19
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,560
She'll fix me.

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,920
What about

21
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:42,880
telling her

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,560
we are traveling?

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,960
Traveling

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,000
in the bedroom?

25
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,880
Then do you have another way?

26
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,200
It's all your fault.

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,920
I have a way.

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,679
Mom.

29
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,159
Sui.

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,200
Why is the sky bright there?

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,159
Gu Shen brought me to Paris.

32
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,319
Why did you go to Paris?

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,079
Aren't we going to have dinner
with our relatives this weekend?

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
Mom.

35
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Don't blame her.

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,799
I brought her here.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,439
I want her to get
the feeling of romance.

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,280
Romance?

39
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,719
That's great.

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,280
- When will you be back?
- Mom.

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
We'll go back next week.

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,760
I'll make up for the dinner for you.

43
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,519
Good, good.

44
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,239
Mom.

45
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,280
It's a bad connection.

46
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,000
I gotta hang up.

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,640
Bye.

48
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm so tired.

49
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,239
Give me a hand.

50
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,959
My job is done here, right?

51
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm leaving.

52
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,239
Take away the backdrop.

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
Bye.

54
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,239
How is it?

55
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm smart, right?

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,079
If it weren't for my cleverness,

57
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,280
you wouldn't be able
to hold on even for one more second.

58
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,159
Why don't you talk
about how fat you are?

59
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,799
Who's fat?

60
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,280
Why don't you talk
about how weak you are?

61
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,319
Wanna try it?

62
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,800
(Huzhou Youth Volunteer)
The car broke down again?

63
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,840
Okay, I'm ready to go now.

64
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,360
That's it.

65
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,479
Let's talk about it when we meet.

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,439
Bye.

67
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,439
How come you walk
without making any sound?

68
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,680
You're going out? But it's the weekend.

69
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm going to do volunteer activities.

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,639
I ordered a taxi.

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,400
I gotta go.

72
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,120
(Mind traffic rules,
and go with courtesy)

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,080
Hello. Take a look.

74
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,800
Hello. Take a look.

75
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,280
Hello.

76
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,400
Where are you?

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm on Guangyu Street.

78
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Okay.

79
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,400
What's the matter?

80
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
I don't know.

81
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Gu Shen said to bring me something.
