00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:07,559
You've worked hard

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,560
and had a busy day.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:09,599
Drink some water.

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,800
Thank you.

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello. Parking is prohibited here.

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,079
Gu Shen?

9
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,359
Why are you here?

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,120
I'll lend you my car.

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,760
Why do you do that?

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,199
Your car broke down, didn't it?

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,879
You give me your car.

14
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,879
Then what about you?

15
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,800
Ji Chuan can drive me back.

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,480
Don't bother.

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,640
I can take a taxi.

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,840
Mrs. Gu.

19
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,479
This is my obligation as your partner.

20
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,600
And it's so far from home.

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,560
It's not a good idea
to take a taxi back.

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,600
Alright.

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,399
We were just thinking

24
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,399
about how we could go back later.

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,719
Thank you.

26
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,280
Take care on the way.

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
Wow.

28
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,640
How nice of him.

29
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,960
He looks cold,

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,439
but he cares so much about you.

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,599
I'm so envious.

32
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,760
We are just a contractual couple.

33
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,359
Fine, fine.

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,719
Contractual couple.

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,680
But,

36
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,359
you're a traffic safety propagandist.

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,879
You can't park the car here.

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,640
Then

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
go with me to park the car.

40
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,719
Okay.

41
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,280
Let's go.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,319
Do you understand?

43
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,280
(Director Office)

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,239
But, Mrs. Huang,

45
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,799
how can we get that?

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
We are just saleswomen,

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,040
not agents.

48
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,519
Where to do it,

49
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
how to do it,

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,519
it's your business.

51
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,719
I only care about the results.

52
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,239
But, Mrs. Huang...

53
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,040
Mrs. Huang.

54
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,040
Leave it

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,200
to me.

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,000
Buy it.

57
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
Just a bag.

58
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,519
It's a piece of cake.

59
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll buy the biggest one for you.

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
A 24-inch one.

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay?

62
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,800
Okay.

63
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,159
Go traveling?

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,680
What a coincidence

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
to see you here.

66
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,120
Sir.

67
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,400
Coffee, please.

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,879
Just a second.

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,719
He's paying.

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,120
Isn't this the assistant
of my bro's wife?

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Bestie.

72
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,439
Bestie.

73
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,039
Bestie.

74
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,639
So,

75
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,000
what are you here for?

76
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,400
I...

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,439
I want to be friends with you.
