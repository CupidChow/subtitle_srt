You're now the wife of a president.

00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,119
Why are we still eating
instant noodles here?

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,400
What's wrong with instant noodles?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,919
You like them, don't you?

I'll leave Zi Zhen to you.

26
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,119
They're not like
a contractual couple at all.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,759
Lovers before friends.
