2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,439
I'm done.

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,119
Let's go.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,000
What are you thinking?

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,600
I just saw Ning Sui.

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,200
So what?

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,920
What's wrong?

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,719
I was thinking,

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,280
why did she come to the hotel?

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,679
What else can people do in a hotel?

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,600
I was joking.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,880
You are a contractual couple.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
Not a real one.

14
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,880
Can't she date anyone?

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,239
In the eyes of others, she is Mrs. Gu.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,959
Fine, fine.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,159
What about this?

18
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,280
I'll find you one too.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,120
Okay.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,200
Hello.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,840
Xin.

22
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,319
I haven't seen you in a long time.

23
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:25,959
What?

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,040
Going to a mountain resort this weekend?

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,799
Sure.

26
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,400
It's a deal then.

27
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,400
This weekend.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,319
I'll see you there.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,079
You're going out this weekend?

30
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,480
Yeah.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,159
What's wrong?

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,959
I'll go out on a business trip tomorrow

33
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,760
and come back the day after tomorrow.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,599
You accompany me home this weekend.

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,680
So unlucky.

36
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,079
You just heard it.

37
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,840
I have promised Xin.

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,920
No.

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,599
You have to go home
with me this weekend.

40
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,799
Wait, is it the point?

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,959
Don't you wonder who Xin is?

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,159
Wonder?

43
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,120
Why should I wonder?

44
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,200
The point is you have to
accompany me home.

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,760
So embarrassing.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,159
I have promised Xin.

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey.

48
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,759
It's clear in our contract.

49
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,120
You have to play the show with me.

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,840
But Xin...

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,879
You can change to another day.

52
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,680
Where are you going?

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,280
I can't go with you this weekend.

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,159
I won't go anywhere.

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,960
I've already told my relatives.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,319
Now you tell me that you can't go.

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,960
How do I explain it to my mom?

58
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,280
I really can't go with you.

59
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,759
You're not going, right?

60
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,439
Anyway, my mom hasn't met you.

61
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,400
I'll find someone else.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,719
Gu Shen.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,879
Take a look.

64
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,400
How about I wear this
for the family dinner?

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,479
You're serious?

66
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,520
You're acting weird.

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,319
You're not going

68
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,680
and don't allow someone else to go.

69
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,080
My contractual husband.
