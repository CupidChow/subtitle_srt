00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,439
Sui.

4
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,879
You are here.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,319
I am.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,840
Can you do me a favor?

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,239
Sure.

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,319
Mr. Gu.

9
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,480
Thank you.

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,200
Mrs. Gu.

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,599
Hello, everyone.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,799
This is Gu Shen.

13
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,159
Thank you all for your concern.

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,239
But I want to tell you that

15
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,560
I am fine.

16
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,159
I'm here right now.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,879
Good idea.

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,000
Stand in the crowd

19
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,959
and the rumor ceases itself.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,719
And,

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,079
I would like
to formally introduce my wife to you.

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Ning Sui.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,079
Great.

24
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,560
But...

25
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,319
He's...

26
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,680
He's gotten over it.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
How did he do that?

28
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,280
Ning Sui cured it.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,079
As long as Ning Sui is by his side,

30
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,319
he's fine.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,079
I've known her for a long time,

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,760
but I never thought
she would have medicinal use.

33
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,400
Where did you go last night?

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
It happened so fast.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,039
But,

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
we took this opportunity

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,199
to eliminate some unnecessary troubles
for the company

38
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,479
and clear some obstacles.

39
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,840
What about Mrs. Huang?

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,000
Mrs. Huang and Manager Sun
got the information from somewhere

41
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,120
and spread it.

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,439
But they've been convicted of libel

43
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,159
by the relevant department.

44
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,680
That's good.

45
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,080
I worried about you all night.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
You worried about me all night?

47
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,800
I...

48
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,599
misspoke.

49
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,680
Zi Zhen.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
Don't be angry with me, okay?

51
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,280
What are you doing?

52
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,560
People are watching.

53
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,960
So what?

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
I was kissing my girlfriend.

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
But...

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,159
What's going on with the suppliers?

57
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,439
We were not going to work with them.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,159
It's okay.

59
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,759
I have a diamond mine.

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Don't need to worry
about the supply of raw materials.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,439
I never thought

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,280
I'd know such a rich man.

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,479
I'm not only a rich man,

64
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,879
but your man.

65
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,199
