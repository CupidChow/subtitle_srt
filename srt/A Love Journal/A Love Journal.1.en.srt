00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,600
(How dare you cheat on me!)

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,879
Sui.

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,839
(You are in big trouble.)

00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:29,960
(Bad guy!)

(Get lost!)

7
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,520
I don't think

8
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,799
we need to get married anymore.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,119
Take it.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,320
(I'll let you know
what's waiting for you)

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,039
(if you're a womanizer.)

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,039
Hurry up.

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,799
Hide quickly.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,719
What's wrong?

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,039
Sometimes you need to smile

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,280
in the face of life.

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,000
What do your parents do?

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,600
- My parents...
- Mom.

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,759
Zhang Mo said to take us
to go shopping this afternoon.

00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,079
Oh, my God!

VVIP client,

Mrs. Peng?

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,439
Bad guy!

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,519
Bad guy!

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,519
Bad guy!

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,319
Bad guy!

Sui.

28
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,760
Don't be angry.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Such a man is not worth it.

30
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,159
Even if I don't want him,

31
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,000
it doesn't mean I want him
to be taken away.

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,079
What about the invitation
sent by your mother?

33
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,359
I'll go find another one.

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,239
How?

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,439
I'll marry you.

36
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,359
Gu Shen?

37
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,680
How come I got married in such a way?

38
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,359
The two parties
will divorce in one year.

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,519
(Marriage Agreement)
The woman will get three houses,

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,040
any of the man's vehicles,

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,719
and

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,640
one-tenth

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,439
of the man's deposit.

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Miss Ning.

45
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,120
Please take a look.

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,760
Sui.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,519
Is that true?

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Pinch me.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,319
I shouldn't have brought you out

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,719
to embarrass me.

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,680
God.

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,319
Miss Ning.

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
If you have no other conditions,

54
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,799
you can sign now.

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
I disagree.

56
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,599
I'll marry you,

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,959
but I don't want anything

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,719
in the contract.

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,719
Are you nuts?

60
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,120
Let's register our marriage now.

61
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,040
Oh, my God!

62
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
What kind of people are those?

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,520
I-I have a question.

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,240
Why do we have to sleep

65
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,879
in the same bed?

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
My mom comes here sometimes.

67
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,599
If she sees us sleeping
in separate rooms,

68
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,120
she would be suspicious of it.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,879
It seems to make sense.

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
But,

71
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
why do I feel like

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
I got trapped?

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,800
Let's sleep.
