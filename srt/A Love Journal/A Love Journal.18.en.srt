2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,480
What's wrong with Gu Shen?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
Tell me.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,640
He wanted to tell you himself.

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,399
He has severe social phobia.

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,160
Social phobia?

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,320
Yeah.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,960
Whenever he is in a crowded place

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,239
or an unfamiliar environment,

10
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,679
it would trigger stress responses.

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,640
These symptoms are mild.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,240
If the situation is more serious,

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,079
it can be life-threatening.

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,079
But...

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,200
Why can he go shopping with me?

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,200
Because he's trying to get over it

17
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,159
for you.

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,759
For me?

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,560
He wants to go back
to your home with you.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,520
Accompany me home this Saturday.

21
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,640
Okay?

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,200
I've got something to do this weekend.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,959
Next time.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
How do I explain it to my mom?

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,239
I really can't go with you.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,640
Are you afraid of accompanying me home?

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,319
A little bit.

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,840
After all, it will be my first time
to meet so many of your relatives.
