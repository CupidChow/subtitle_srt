2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,000
What kind of friends?

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,199
That depends on you.

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,320
I have something to ask you.

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,160
You were there that day too,

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,879
right?

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
Did you go to meet a friend?

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,640
A man or woman?

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,479
Are you asking for Mr. Gu

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,000
or for yourself?

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,399
Is there a difference?

12
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:43,840
A man.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,759
But,

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,479
not my boyfriend.

15
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,640
I didn't ask that.

16
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,000
I just wanted to tell you

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,759
I don't have a boyfriend.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
What a coincidence.

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,200
I don't have a girlfriend.

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,159
What day is it today?

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
Why do you invite me to dinner?

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Today...

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,599
I miss you.

24
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,159
Mom.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
(Why didn't you tell me?)

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,000
Sui.

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,879
I'm telling you,

28
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,040
I went shopping today
and bought you some gifts.

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,200
So many.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,319
Not many.

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm telling you,

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,200
when I was shopping,

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
I saw a pair of shoes

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
that fit you very well.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,560
Put on them.

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,439
I can't take them, mom.

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,079
Too expensive.

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,159
Not at all.

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,599
Just a pair of shoes.

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,319
Take them

41
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,120
and put them on.

42
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,079
Gu Shen.

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,079
How do you treat your wife?

44
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,719
Bags, clothes, shoes.

45
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,239
You didn't buy anything for your wife.

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
(Should I accept the shoes or not?)

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,280
When will you learn
to care about your wife?

48
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,640
Mom.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Let's eat first.

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,439
Right, right.

51
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,120
Mom.

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,439
Let's eat first.

53
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,159
Fine.

54
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:57,799
Here.

55
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,239
You sit with Gu Shen.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Mom, try this.

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,360
You eat it.

58
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,599
I'm happy if you eat it.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm happy.

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,919
Gu Shen.

61
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,080
Serve her some food.

62
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,560
Mrs. Huang.

63
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,639
What a coincidence.

64
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,120
If I hadn't had dinner
with my client here,

65
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,240
I wouldn't have known

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
you have such a relationship
with the Gu family.

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
Aren't you

68
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,639
going to explain it to me,

69
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,439
Mrs. Gu?

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,159
That's right.

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,719
I married Gu Shen,

72
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,039
but I always follow the work ethic.

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
He doesn't know anything about my job.

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,360
Are you joking?

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,599
No wonder Canxiang can't fight Liujin.

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,599
I thought it was because of Manager Sun.

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,360
I didn't expect it.

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,280
I really underestimated you.

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm not lying.

80
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,240
And Gu Shen doesn't know
that I'm working for Canxiang.
