2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,480
Mrs. Huang knows it?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,119
What a coincidence.

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:11,839
She saw you there.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,679
Maybe

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,079
it's my destiny.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,480
Since when did you start
to believe in fate?

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,960
Is it my fate

9
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,239
to meet Gu Shen?

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,679
Zi Zhen.

11
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,520
Drink with me.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,280
Let the world be destroyed.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Then I won't have to
do things I don't want to do.

14
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,920
Enough, Sui.

15
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,079
Look at yourself. You're drunk.

16
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,319
Is Gu Shen that important to you?

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,599
It's not the same thing.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,359
There should be no betrayal

19
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,359
between me and him.

20
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
Come on.

21
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,159
You can't rely on him all your life.

22
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,760
If Mrs. Huang does something,

23
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,319
your career will be over.

24
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,760
I know it.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Zi Zhen.

26
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,159
If you were me,

27
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,799
which would you choose?

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,319
Career is the base,

29
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,239
and men are extra embellishment.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,519
But,

31
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,439
men are unreliable.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,199
Gu Shen.

33
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,080
Let me ask you.

34
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,080
Me or Liujin,

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,680
which one do you choose?

36
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,039
Silly girl.

37
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,599
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,120
Alright.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Then...

40
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,479
Accompany me home this Saturday.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,879
Okay?

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,560
I...

43
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,120
I've got something to do this weekend.

44
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,560
Next time.

45
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,639
I'll get you a towel.
