Come on.

00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,199
Hurry up.

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,600
I can't.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm dog-tired.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,519
Dear,

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,519
you can't?

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,679
I can.

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,239
How can I say I can't?

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,199
Sunglasses.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,399
Here.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,199
Sunscreen.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,800
Here.

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,640
Fruit.

16
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,719
Here.

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,800
Milk.

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,359
Here.

19
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,920
How nice of you.

20
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,759
Gross.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,719
Are you

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,600
envious?

23
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,600
We're ready.

24
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,359
Let's go.

25
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:39,960
Great.

26
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,880
Let's go.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,399
Gu Shen.

28
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,439
Lower, lower.

29
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,679
Ji Chuan.

30
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,600
Okay.

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,120
Gu Shen.

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Are you better now?

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,359
I'm already over it.

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,280
I knew

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
you could make it.

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,120
No.

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,760
It's because I have you

38
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,680
and I fear nothing now.

39
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,079
When I was a boy,
my parents were very busy.

40
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,920
Even when they came home,

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
they were always fighting.

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,840
So I was always alone at home.

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,959
The house was too big.

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,920
I didn't dare to sleep,

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,040
so I hid in the closet

46
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,920
all night.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
Later I went to school.

48
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,319
The so-called elite school

49
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,120
was just a gathering place for people
who have contempt for the weak.

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,959
I didn't like them.

51
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,680
So I

52
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,439
gradually became withdrawn.

53
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,079
Later I went to college abroad.

54
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,879
Although I learned something,

55
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,040
I was alone in a foreign country.

56
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know why.

57
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,799
I became a man like this.

58
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,920
I don't know
how I could have gotten through

59
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,640
that time without Ji Chuan.

60
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,319
Now you're by my side.

61
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,520
I didn't know the meaning of home

62
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,759
until the day you moved in.

63
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,960
But...

64
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,759
will you leave me one day too?

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
Are you cursing me?

66
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
That's not what I meant.

67
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,159
I'm afraid...

68
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,400
I will be with you forever.
