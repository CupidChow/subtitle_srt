Gu Shen.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,480
Look.

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm a little scared.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,400
Don't be scared.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,719
It must be my mother.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,480
That's what I'm afraid of.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
How did you come up
with this "smart" idea?

9
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,399
I have no choice

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,240
but to do this.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,359
I can't do it anymore.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,679
I can't go on anymore.

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,439
I really can't.

14
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,799
This method is too painful.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,039
It's not good?

16
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,000
We have to try another way.

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,840
No, no. Gu Shen.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
It's so tiring.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Let's try another way.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,679
Just hold on.

21
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,039
My mother will go to sleep soon.

That's great.
