2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Why don't you have breakfast?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,560
I have no appetite.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,879
You didn't sleep well last night?

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,560
(I can't fall asleep at all.)

6
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,840
Are you done?

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
I'll drive you to work.

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
No, no.

9
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,319
I'm not going to the company today.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,959
I'm going to meet a client.

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,640
A big client.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,959
Let's chat.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,840
How does it feel to marry a president?

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,760
Nothing.

15
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,040
We've already known each other.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,480
You look too calm.

17
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,719
Can that be the same?

18
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,680
He was dull

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,560
when he was in high school.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,519
What if she's in heavy debt now?

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
What if she's a gambler?

22
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,519
You think I can't afford it?

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,280
Now he is
the president of Liujin Group.

24
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,599
He is still a human being.

25
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,079
I have to get someone
to check her background.

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:42,840
No need.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,480
I trust her.

28
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,359
That's different.

29
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,480
President.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,239
Did you forget

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,640
she didn't want any

32
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,879
of the things I gave her?

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,120
We are just a contractual couple.

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,439
I want to deal with my mom,

35
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,760
and he wants to deal with his mom.

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,599
We married

37
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,079
for our own purposes.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,359
If I take his things,

39
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,840
that would be weird.

40
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,920
How strange.

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,680
I rarely see a girl
who doesn't love money.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
That's because
you haven't met the right one.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
You're speaking for her now?

44
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,439
Have you told him
that you work for Canxiang?

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,719
I told him

46
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,039
that I'm a planner
in an advertising company.

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
You're a couple

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,960
and also business rivals.

49
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,639
Aren't you afraid to bump into him?

50
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,039
You work in the same building.

51
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,240
Thousands of people
come and go here every day.

52
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,120
Besides,

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,479
we haven't met each other here before.

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
Yeah.

55
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,520
Hi.

56
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,719
(Think of something.)

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
(What can I do?)

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,080
(Can I...?)
