[Episode 11]

3
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,180
It seems that...

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,300
you do know about the rash.

5
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,140
But how did you know about it?

6
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,740
Have you heard of...

7
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,540
Zhe Gu Shao?

8
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,780
Zhe Gu Shao?

9
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,300
What's your relationship with him?

10
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,020
Wait, Old Man.

11
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,340
That's her question.

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,900
Hurry. Answer me.

13
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,740
Zhe Gu Shao is my grandfather.

14
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,020
I'm a blind old man.

15
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,820
Don't lie to me.

16
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,020
Come forward,

17
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,700
let me touch.

18
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Wait, Old Man.

19
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,940
What's going on here?

20
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,020
Can't you talk about it without touching her?

21
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,300
If not, how can I know what she said is true?

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,980
No.

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,620
What does it mean?

24
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,540
It's called bone-touching.

25
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,300
He did the same to me.

26
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,580
That's how he finds out things.

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,020
Sir, you seem to know my grandfather.

28
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,820
I don't mind you confirming it.

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,540
You heard it right.

30
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,900
Higher.

31
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,700
A head with four sides.

32
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,500
A face with three fists.

33
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,740
It's him.

34
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540
Miss,

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,660
do you know who I am?

36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,020
No, I don't.

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,700
Have a look.

38
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,580
Isn't this Little Mystical Dagger, belonging to
the leader of Unloading Mountain Sect?

39
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,140
You have sharp eyes.

40
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,140
I am...

41
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,300
Chen Yu Lou.

42
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,420
It's you!

43
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,260
Chen Yu Lou?

44
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,460
Kid,

45
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,380
what's your name?

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,020
Shirley.

47
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,220
Shirley Yang.

48
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,380
Shirley Yang?

49
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,420
What a good name.

50
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,100
Well. What's going on?

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,660
Do you know each other?

52
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,540
In my grandfather's diary,

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,380
there are many stories about you.

54
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,340
Even when he was staying abroad,

55
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,780
he was always thinking about
your friendship and experiences.

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,460
What a pity.

57
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,260
What a pity!

58
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,180
What happened

59
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,380
cannot be reproduced.

60
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,820
Your grandfather and I

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,180
did appreciate one another.

62
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,100
Unfortunately,

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,460
after he left,

64
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,700
he didn't come back at all.

65
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,060
I was looking for him,

66
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,220
but I only know he went abroad.

67
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,420
Where is he, my friend?

68
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,100
I bumped into him here before.

69
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,260
Before I left,

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,820
I saw him walking to that house.

71
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,500
That way?

72
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:55,940
Yes.

73
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,300
Hurry up!

74
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,420
Walk faster.

75
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,460
Over there?

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,860
Yes, that house.

77
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,940
Where? Here?

78
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,620
Here.

79
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,300
Mr. Jin, let's check it out.

80
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,380
Whose house is this?

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
What are you doing? Hurry up.

82
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,300
No, he...

83
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:21,900
Hurry up.

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm asking him.

85
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,180
Mr. Jin,

86
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,260
why do they...

87
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,940
look so familiar?

88
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,820
Aren't you the guests from Beijing?

89
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,380
I knew it.

90
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,140
Didn't they try to blow us up?

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,460
I...

92
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,980
Scoundrel.

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,860
Fatty,

94
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,300
what do we do now?

95
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,620
What?

96
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,580
Let's beat them up.

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,700
Didn't we agree not to hit my face?

98
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,060
Enough.

99
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,340
Let's talk.

100
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,420
You're so unlucky...

101
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,620
to have met our buddy
patrolling in the mountain.

102
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,620
Come on.

103
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,340
Let's pierce both of them.

104
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,340
Wait, what?

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,020
What will they do to me?

106
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,020
It's a slang of bandits.

107
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,020
It means they're going to kill us.

108
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,020
This skinny man seemed to...

109
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,620
hit my head with a brick the day before yesterday.

110
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,780
Third Brother.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,140
Eldest Brother.

112
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
You know what to do.

113
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,900
Yes.

114
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,100
These are old stories.

115
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,540
Let's put it behind.

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,660
I've never thought...

117
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,500
I'd meet...

118
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,340
the descendant of my old friend.

119
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,540
Great.

120
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,860
This is great.

121
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,180
Old Man,

122
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,820
It seems that...

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,620
you were a very famous figure.

124
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,620
But why are you staying here?

125
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,100
It's a long story.

126
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,820
That year, I went to Yunnan...

127
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,900
where my brothers were killed,

128
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,260
and I got injured.

129
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,860
Now,

130
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,220
I'm no longer a leader.

131
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,140
My whole life...

132
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,060
is full of...

133
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,580
ups and downs.

134
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,300
When I look back at this age...

135
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,820
I can see

136
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,700
how transient my life was.

137
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,580
That's why I decided to hide my identity...

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,700
and stay here for the rest of my life.

139
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,620
But why are you...

140
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,860
looking for Li Chun Feng's tomb?

141
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,460
We speculate that...

142
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,460
there are clues about Dust Bead...

143
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,340
in it.

144
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,860
I'm sorry that Zhe Gu Shao and his sect

145
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,980
cannot escape this fate.

146
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,780
But I can't be of help to you.

147
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,860
It's okay, Sir Chen.

148
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,860
We've found out...

149
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,300
Feng Shui of Li Chun Feng's tomb.

150
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,940
We just need to try harder.

151
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,900
The only one Build-in Well...

152
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,340
will be found eventually.

153
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,300
Brother,

154
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
I know you're watching us from heaven.

155
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,060
What did you say? The Build-in Well?

156
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,940
Yes.

157
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,020
That's right. Miss.

158
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,820
The Build-in Well...

159
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,940
is right here.

160
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,220
Really?

161
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,540
Here you go.

162
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,940
And you.

163
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,220
Here it is.

164
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,900
What is this?

165
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,820
I made this bomb...

166
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,180
especially for you.

167
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,700
No.

168
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
Please have mercy on us.

169
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,940
Please.

170
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,300
Please don't kill us.

171
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,860
Don't worry, I'm good at this.

172
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,940
Eldest Brother, who should I kill first?

173
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,900
Please.

174
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,340
I have money.

175
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,220
Wait,

176
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,860
you have money?

177
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,300
That's a fine tooth.

178
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,300
Pull it out.

179
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,140
No, no, sir,

180
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,740
I'm talking about a great fortune.

181
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,940
It's around his neck.

182
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,660
Mr. Jin, what do you mean?

183
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,540
What are you doing? Stop.

184
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,140
What are you doing?

185
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,380
What are you doing? Stop it.

186
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,940
Fatty,

187
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,220
this is...

188
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,180
a life and death situation.

189
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,820
Let's save our lives.

190
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,380
That's a Mojin Talisman.

191
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,740
Golden Tooth, how could you betray me? I'll bite you.

192
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,060
Sir, you have a sharp eye.

193
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,420
Yes, it's an authentic Mojin Talisman.

194
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,100
It's a cultural relic from
the Three Kingdoms Period.

195
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,380
Only Mojin Xiaowei can wear it.

196
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,940
Are you really Mojin Xiaowei?

197
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,340
What is Mojin Xiaowei?

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,460
Eldest Brother,

199
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,100
they do gold panning in rivers.

200
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,660
If you don't know,

201
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,060
could you ask this man over there?

202
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,140
Surely you know what Mojin Xiaowei does.

203
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,940
Gold panning? Nonsense.

204
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,100
They are...

205
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,220
stealing valuables from tombs.

206
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,980
That's right.

207
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,420
This fat man...

208
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,140
is a Mojin Xiaowei.

209
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,700
It's an ancestral craft.

210
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,500
And he has the Tomb Calming Skill.

211
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,700
When we look at this land,

212
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,660
it's just a vast land.

213
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,660
But with him,

214
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Surely there're...

215
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,140
numerous valuables beneath it.

216
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,860
He's a Mojin Xiaowei.

217
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
What do you do?

218
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,900
I...

219
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,500
Eldest Brother,

220
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm sure this skinny man isn't a Mojin Xiaowei.

221
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,180
Because he doesn't have Mojin Talisman.

222
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,500
What's wrong?

223
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,420
The bomb.

224
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,380
What's wrong, man?

225
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,060
It's lighted.

226
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,900
It's lighted.

227
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
Gosh.

228
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,540
What?

229
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,500
Didn't you say you were good at it?

230
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,300
You scared me to death.

231
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,580
What are you doing?

232
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,060
I won't do it again.

233
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,100
Don't ever do that again.

234
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,620
Sir,

235
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,020
I'm useful too.

236
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
In what way?

237
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,340
As the saying goes,

238
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,020
Mojin Xiaowei, united we stand, divided we fall.

239
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,980
They can't fight alone.

240
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,260
They must do things together.

241
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,260
Why are you mentioning this?

242
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,220
I'll bite you to death.

243
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,740
Fatty,

244
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Does this saying exit?

245
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,700
Probably.

246
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,580
Yes, it does.

247
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,940
Do you remember...

248
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,500
Hu Ba Yi? He's with us.

249
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,780
He is a Mojin Xiaowei too.

250
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,900
To be honest,

251
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,820
the reason we're still in Gulan County...

252
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,020
is to find the tomb...

253
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,780
to make the trip worthwhile.

254
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,420
What tomb?

255
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,900
After returning from Yunnan,

256
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,500
I felt

257
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,900
I couldn't lead Unloading Mountain Sect.

258
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,060
But at the time,

259
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,940
I bumped into a member of Mojin Sect.

260
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,820
His name was Golden Abacus.

261
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,260
He said there was a big tomb here,

262
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,060
so we built the fish-skeleton temple here...

263
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,060
as a cover-up.

264
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,540
But it's such a pity.

265
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,940
He went into it and never came out.

266
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,820
He said...

267
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,300
the Build-in Well was in it.

268
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,460
If that's the case,

269
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,020
the senior in the temple...

270
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,580
is Golden Abacus.

271
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes.

272
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,060
My grandfather hadn't found Golden Abacus.

273
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,620
I never thought he'd become your partner.

274
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,500
It's all fate.

275
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,300
Built-in Well is under the fish-skeleton temple.

276
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,980
That's impossible.

277
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,900
I've been down there.

278
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,340
It's a tomb of the Western Zhou dynasty.

279
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,060
Golden Abacus didn't say...

280
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,220
which dynasty the tomb came from.

281
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,140
Did we get it wrong?

282
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,420
I'm quite confident about it.

283
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,220
Now it's sure that...

284
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,220
Built-in Well does exist.

285
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,020
And it's right here in Gulan County.

286
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,780
That means at least we're right about it.

287
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,980
You're right.

288
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,540
It's too early to rush to the conclusion.

289
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,020
We need to check out what's under the temple.

290
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,700
We must understand the situation
first before taking action.

291
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Tell the truth or I'll blow you up.

292
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,460
Please don't.

293
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,220
Third Brother.

294
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,940
Don't be reckless.

295
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,940
Use your brain.

296
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,060
Little skinny man,

297
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,620
don't try to trick me.

298
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,260
I know every single tomb...

299
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,220
in this county.

300
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,580
If you lie to me,

301
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,020
I'll pull your golden tooth out.

302
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,740
That big tomb...

303
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,300
is beneath the fish-skeleton temple.

304
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,060
Nonsense.

305
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,620
It there a tomb under the temple?

306
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,340
No, I'm not talking nonsense.

307
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
Nonsense.

308
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,700
You scared me.

309
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,020
Yes, there's a tomb of Western Zhou dynasty...

310
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,020
beneath the fish-skeleton temple.

311
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,740
And there're many valuables in it.

312
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,700
But it's a very dangerous place.

313
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,300
Without the help of Mojin Xiaowei,

314
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,020
you won't be able to get out alive.

315
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,700
You need at least two Mojin Xiaoweis...

316
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,700
to help you get those valuables.

317
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,660
I can help you...

318
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,860
get the third one.

319
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,580
All three of us will help you get those valuables.

320
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,100
But we have a request.

321
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,420
Once you get them,

322
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,420
you must let three of us go.

323
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,180
Mr. Hu.

324
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,100
Where are you, Mr. Hu?

325
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,340
Mr. Hu.

326
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,020
Mr. Jin.

327
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,180
What's wrong?

328
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,900
Mr. Hu.

329
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,220
Mr. Hu, I'm left with no choice.

330
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,340
There was a huge land mine on my neck.

331
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,300
I can't take it.

332
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,500
I told them you are a Mojin Xiaowei.

333
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,220
What do you mean?

334
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,980
He got Fatty.

335
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,980
Who?

336
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,180
Ma Da Dan.

337
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,740
Fine. Let's go save him now.

338
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,940
Old man, we have something urgent to do to.

339
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,740
See you.

340
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,060
I'll visit you later.

341
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,260
Please don't blame me.

342
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,820
That was a huge land mine.

343
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,860
And it's right on my neck.

344
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,180
I can't take it.

345
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,180
It's here.

346
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,660
Something wrong.

347
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,580
Where are they?

348
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,180
They were all here just now.

349
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,620
Ma Da Dan.

350
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,860
Fatty.

351
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,660
Fatty.

352
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,580
Where are you?

353
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,420
Fatty.

354
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,100
You lock me here.

355
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,500
What for?

356
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,820
Hu Ba Yi.

357
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,180
There's sound here.

358
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,700
Answer me.

359
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,700
It's down here.

360
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,260
Push it.

361
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,820
Where are you?

362
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Where are you?

363
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,180
It's Fatty's voice.

364
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,700
I need to go down there.

365
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,940
Mr. Hu, be careful.

366
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,860
I'll go down too.

367
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,220
I also...

368
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,340
Stay here...

369
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,340
and guard the entrance.

370
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,620
If there's anything, deal with it.

371
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,460
Okay.

372
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,660
Ma Da Dan,

373
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,940
I dare you to let me out.

374
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
I'll kill you first.

375
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,300
Ma Da Dan,

376
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,740
where are you?

377
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
I dare you to come down and fight with me.

378
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,100
Why are you locking me in this shabby cage?

379
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,220
Come down and I'll kill you.

380
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,500
Ma Da Dan,

381
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,540
can't you say something?

382
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,580
Fatty.

383
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,020
Old Hu.

384
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,260
Great, you're here.

385
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,180
Are you alright?

386
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,460
I'm fine now.

387
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,300
Hold on. I'm going to save you.

388
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,220
Be careful.

389
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,140
Old Hu.

390
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,060
Don't worry.

391
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,180
Old Hu, don't come here.

392
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,060
There are piranhas in the water.

393
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,500
Piranhas?

394
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,620
Look.

395
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,220
We can climb across along the chain...

396
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
and unclench the cylinder.

397
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,620
I'll do it.

398
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,980
Be careful.

399
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,020
Be careful.

400
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,380
Be careful.

401
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,260
Be careful.

402
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,060
Hold tight.

403
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,220
Hu Ba Yi.

404
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,260
Watch out!

405
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,660
Come up.

406
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,220
Come on.

407
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,860
Mr. Hu,

408
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,740
do you need me?

409
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,100
Mr. Hu,

410
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,020
I know you need me.

411
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,900
I'm coming.

412
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,620
Old Hu,

413
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,060
be careful,

414
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,540
otherwise, I can't hold on.

415
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,900
The chain can't bear your weight.

416
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,620
Let me do it. I'm lighter than you.

417
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,460
No, you can't do it.

418
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,660
Do you have any other options?

419
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,140
Yes.

420
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,020
I'll do it.

421
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,180
You shouldn't do that.

422
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,460
With your weight,

423
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,500
Fatty might drag you into the cylinder.

424
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,020
Be careful.

425
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,460
I saw a padlock...

426
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,900
on the cylinder.

427
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,220
We can't open it without the password.

428
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,220
I'll get up there first.

429
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,660
Be careful.

430
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Hang in there.

431
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,060
Can't you be more careful?

432
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,980
I'm begging you.

433
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,620
I don't want to die.

434
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,340
Can you open it?

435
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,580
It's an ancient lock known as flower padlock.

436
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,700
It requires three sets of passwords to unlock it.

437
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,820
It's complicated.

438
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,740
What?

439
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,980
Isn't Moving Mountain Sect good
at unlocking locks?

440
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,580
Hurry up, I can't take it anymore.

441
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,740
Fatty, don't feel panic.

442
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,860
Hurry up,

443
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,300
I can't hold on.

444
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,740
How is it going?

445
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,340
It's unlocked.

446
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,900
Unlocked?

447
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,540
No way, it's way too heavy.

448
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,260
I'll go and help them.

449
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,820
No.

450
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,700
What if the chain breaks?

451
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,660
Grappling Hook.

452
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,780
Yes.

453
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,060
Stand firm.

454
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,380
Fatty.

455
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,380
Got it.

456
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,700
Watch out.

457
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,620
Fatty.

458
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,060
Are you alright?

459
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,260
I'm fine, thanks.

460
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,660
How is it?

461
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,780
are you alright?

462
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,780
I'm fine.

463
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,540
Old Hu, I'm fine.

464
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,460
If...

465
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,100
it hadn't been for Meal Ticket,

466
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,220
I would have died.

467
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,420
What Meal Ticket?

468
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,940
Nothing. Thank you, Ms. Yang.

469
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,580
Mr. Jin, are you alright?

470
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,060
Are you alright, Mr. Jin?

471
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,420
Old Hu,

472
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,820
Ma Da Dan is something.

473
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,020
I'm wondering where he got this cylinder.

474
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,820
It looks like an antique.

475
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,180
Should we...

476
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,820
Shut up.

477
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,900
I know what you're thinking.

478
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,500
You almost had met Karl Marx just now.

479
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,700
And you're still thinking about money.

480
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,300
I should have let the piranhas eat you alive.

481
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,980
Hurry and leave.

482
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,460
No one is up there. Let's go now.

483
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,500
Fine. I didn't really mean it.

484
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,260
Just making a joke.

485
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,700
Let's go.

486
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,380
Move.

487
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,580
You just wait and see.

488
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,460
Once we're out of here, I'll teach you a lesson.

489
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,540
Keep quiet and stand still.

490
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,580
I am standing still.

491
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
You live up to...

492
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,380
the reputation of Mojin Xiaowei.

493
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,860
Since you're all here,

494
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,140
I'll make sure your trip is worthy.

495
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,260
Bring us with you...

496
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,580
to the tomb beneath the fish-bone temple.

497
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,060
Just say yes and you'll be fine.

498
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,380
If not,

499
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,700
we'll kill you all.

500
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,140
We're not afraid of you.

501
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,420
If you kill us,

502
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,100
you won't get those valuables.

503
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
You want to get rich?

504
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,460
If so, just follow me my orders.

505
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,420
Don't try to trick me.

506
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,900
Great.

507
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,300
How are we going to divide them?

508
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,100
No.

509
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,820
You can have them all. Just don't kill us.

510
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,020
That's great.

511
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,460
If you want us to work for you,

512
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,700
you should get us some useful tools.

513
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,500
That's right.

514
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,860
If we bump into some dirty things,

515
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,740
I won't be able to protect you.

516
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm going down the tomb without tools.

517
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,220
You should at least get us
some protective equipment.

518
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,340
For example, mirror armour.

519
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,540
Fifth Brother,

520
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,740
get them some things.

521
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,420
Yes.

522
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,180
Eldest Brother,

523
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,940
can I have a steamed bun?
I'm hungry.

524
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,460
Hungry.

525
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,420
What?

526
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,060
Bring these things down?

527
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,220
No.

528
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,140
How about I give you this?

529
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,260
Don't.

530
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,380
Don't.

531
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't.

532
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,980
My fellow brothers,

533
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,500
I'll pick one of them.

534
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,740
Put this down.

535
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,100
You're not good at choosing things.

536
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,140
Old Hu,

537
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,100
just pick any two of them,

538
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,700
otherwise, we will have nothing.

539
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,580
I...

540
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,420
Mr. Jin,

541
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,180
You're well equipped.

542
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,340
What a nice gong.

543
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,900
Fatty,

544
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,020
I think both of us...

545
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
are...

546
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,500
the same.

547
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,420
You two, why didn't you pick one?

548
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,220
There is nothing I can use.

549
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,140
I have what I want in my bag.

550
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,940
Just these two tools?

551
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,180
What are these?

552
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,740
It's my ancestral...

553
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,660
Vajra Umbrella.

554
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,900
Nothing can destroy it,
be it water, fire, or poison.

555
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,340
It's used to deal with secret traps
or weapons hidden in a tomb.

556
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,460
Grappling hook...

557
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,460
can be used to climb a cliff.

558
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,140
Without these two items,

559
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,180
no matter how strong we are,

560
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,380
we cannot do anything.

561
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,900
You're right.

562
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,660
No matter how professional we are,
we still need these tools.

563
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,220
Eldest Brother,

564
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,140
I think they're right.

565
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,700
I definitely can't work...

566
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,980
without explosives.

567
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:16,980
Eldest Brother,

568
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,260
both of them seem to be weapons.

569
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,460
I dare not give them those.

570
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,300
