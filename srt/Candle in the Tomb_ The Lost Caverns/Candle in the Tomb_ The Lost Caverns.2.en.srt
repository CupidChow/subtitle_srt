Let's do this instead.

5
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,160
Leave us your address...

6
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,400
or contact.

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Shaanxi is far away from here.

8
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,160
We need to talk it over.

9
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,320
Whether we will go or not,

10
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
we'll tell you. Is that okay?

11
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
OK.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,840
I'll wait for your reply.

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,960
Okay.

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,640
I'll see you out.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,520
See you soon.

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280
See.

17

See.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,760
He looks like an honest man.

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Actually, he's a tricky one.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,760
Old Hu,

21
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,040
how much did you want to give him?

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,720
One hundred and eighty is more than enough.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,120
Where's my extra 20 yuan?

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,360
Stop being so calculating.
We're friends after all.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
The meal was 20 yuan.

26
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,680
What are you laughing at?

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,840
I know...

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,320
Mr. Hu very well.

29
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Fatty, do you believe it?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,840
If I were to suggest one thousand yuan...

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
instead of two hundred,

32
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
Mr. Hu would do anything to pay it.

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,480
I deliberately...

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,280
suggested a lower price.

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
In my opinion,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
that shoe is worth 500 yuan.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,480
And it's 1,000 yuan...

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
for a complete pair.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,920
Mr. Hu,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
don't you call me a tricky man.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,280
Our field has its own rules.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,320
An antiques seller must be...

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,840
opportunistic,

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
observant, experienced, and insightful.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
I was being kind to him...

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
for suggesting that price.

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,040
He's an unworldly man after all.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm sure...

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,400
every other seller in Beijing...

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,320
would say the shoe is worth less than 50 yuan.

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Fine.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,200
Stop talking nonsense.

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
I know him better than you.

54

If you were to...

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,520
spend all our money on it,

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,680
we wouldn’t be able...

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
to buy food anymore.

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,440
Would you buy us food?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,880

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
If it hadn't been for Mr. Hu,

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,680
that man wouldn't have told us...

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
about the box.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
And we wouldn't have made a deal with him.

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,400

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440

71

However,

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,560
Let's make it clear now.

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,520
If we are to...

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
buy that box of stuffs,

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,120
I would deal with it afterwards.

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Fatty, don't be anxious.

78
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,280
You're being pushy here.

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,840
it's a nice place.

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,600

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,840
is not bad indeed.

191
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,080
In case we can't make it,

192
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,720
Old Hu,

193
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,840
you will have to sacrifice for us.

194
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,480
Go hook up with her...

195
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,680
and she might support us for long term.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,960
You're really crazy about money.

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,840
Didn't we agree not to do that any longer?

198
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,360
Moreover,

199
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,320
she's not that kind of person like us.

200
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,480
I don't think we'll see her again.

201
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,360
Don't say so.

202
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,840
We depend on her for our livelihood.

203
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
Get lost.

204
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,960
Fine.

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,960
State of Tennessee, America

206
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,000
I brought you some food, Ms. Yang.

207
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,960
Madam has already been dead for two weeks.

208
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,720
If you continue like this,

209
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,880
you'll collapse.

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,960
Carla,

211
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,800
do you know...

212
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,480
where Dad kept Grandpa's belongings?

213
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,360
Well, I'm not so sure.

214
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
Is there any place...

215
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
that he used to store things?

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Except the study room.

217
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,360
I only remember...

218
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
right after you were born,

219
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Mr. Yang rebuilt this place.

220
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,960
Was there any change in the layout?

221
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
I don't think so.

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,880
He was an old-fashioned man.

223
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,440
He only changed the desk.

224
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,670
Stop!

225
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh, my gosh.

226
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,640
What happened?

227
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,760
I was trying to coax him into taking the medicine...

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,280
when he pushed me.

229
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,640
And I hit my head.

230
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,680
I'll take care of him.

231
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,680
You can leave now.

232
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,520
Okay.

233
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,400
Uncle Chen.

234
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,280
Shirley, you're here.

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
What are you doing?

236
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,640
I'm trying to open this treasure box.

237
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,280
Why can't I open it?

238
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,880
Do you know why you can't do so?

239
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,880
Why?

240
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,160
Because you haven't eaten anything yet.

241
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
That's why you don't have the energy to open it.

242
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,120
You're right, I have forgotten to eat.

243
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,360
Here, finish the food.

244
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,360
Sure.

245
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,400
Good.

246
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Oh, yeah,

247
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,520
eight, four, one.

248
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
That's the password.

249
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,560
Eight, four, one.

250
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
Why that combination?

251
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,160
In 841 BC,

252
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,520
there's a riot across the country.

253
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,680
It's the year calendar was introduced in China.

254
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
To us archaeologists,

255
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,760
these three numbers...

256
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,040
are more important than our birth date.

257
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,640
Eight, four...

258
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,760
Eight...

259
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,520
It's open.

260
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,120
I can't let it get oxidized by air.

261
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,560
I've finally opened it.

262
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,520
It's...

263
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
the treasure of Queen of Jingjue.

264
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,400
Eight, four, one. Eight, four...

265
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Eight, four...

266
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
Eight, four...

267
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,800
To us archaeologists,

268
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,280
these three numbers...

269
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,520
are more important than our birth dates.

270
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
Eight, four, one.

271
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,680
Oh my gosh.

272
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
How are you feeling, Fatty?

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
He's really something.

274
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,680
I've been having car sick.

275
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,760
And he's sleeping so soundly.

276
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Fatty.

277
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,520
Have Mr. Hu contacted Ms. Yang...

278
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,920
since he came back from that trip?

279
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
What's the point of doing so?

280
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,040
That American woman is treating...

281
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,440
Professor Chen in the States.

282
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
But Mr. Hu seems to be...

283
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,440
missing her.

284
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
What's the point of missing her?

285
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,520
I don't think he can see her again.

286
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,280
We'll go...

287
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,520
separate ways.

288
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
She's not on our side.

289
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,960
Can't you drive well?

290
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

291
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,160
The car has broken down.

292
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,830
It's broken down.

293
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,920
What's wrong?

294
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,960
It's broken down.

295
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
It's broken down.

296
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
I'm sorry, guys.

297
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
The car is broken down.

298
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,600
What?

299
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,200
What do we do, Mr. Hu?

300
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
We can't just wait here.

301
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Brother Chun Lai,

302
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,160
is there any other way...

303
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
to reach your place?

304
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Let's cross the river then.

305
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,440
But I'm sure if there's any boat.

306
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,240
Is it OK?

307
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,760
Let's go then.

308
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Let's go.

309
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
There's no boat here.

310
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,240
Brother Chun Lai,

311
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,720
we're in the middle of nowhere.

312
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,520
We need a boat,

313
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
otherwise we'll need to
stay the night by the river.

314
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,040
Don't feel panic.

315
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,120
Let's wait. It'll be here soon.

316
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,360
Where?

317
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
Should we...

318
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,600
go back there and check
if the bus is fixed?

319
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Suit yourself.

320
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,600
It took us two hours to get here.

321
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,160
Where will the boat be here?

322
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,680
Old Hu,

323
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,240
since we're here at Yellow River,

324
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
you should sing Xintianyou.

325
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,240
You fat kid, what are you talking about?

326
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm not a shepherd. Why should I sing that sad song?

327
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,240
Let me sing Qinqiang instead.

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,240
He knows how to sing Qinqiang?

329
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,720
♪Shout it out♪

330
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,310
♪outside the tent♪

331
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,110

♪outside♪

333
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,440
The boat is coming!

334
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,280
We're here, Brother!

335
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,960
Here, my brother!

336
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,560
Here!

337
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,880
I need a boat ride, Sir!

338
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
Yes, a boat ride!

339
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,960
No!

340
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
The river level is rising!
I can't stop for you!

341
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,240
Money.

342
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Money!

343
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,040
It's with Golden Tooth!

344
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,280
Why are you asking money from me?

345
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,920
We have money!

346
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,480
We have 10 yuan here!

347
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,160
Come on!

348
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,240
No. No way.

349
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,200
What's going on?

350
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,480
Wait.

351
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,920
How did you know I have extra money?

352
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,960
We have 20 yuan here!

353
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,280
Yes, 20 yuan!

354
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,240
20 yuan!

355
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,520
Fine, wait there! I'm coming!

356
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
He's coming!

357
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,800
Come here!

358
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,720
Hurry up!

359
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,680
Yes, he's coming!

360
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,960
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You just won't hesitate
to take others' money.

362
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,400
There you go.

363
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,320
Thank you.

364
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,120
I wasn't trying to swindle your money.

365
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,960
It's been raining heavily.

366
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
The level of Yellow River has been rising.

367
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,920
Floods are everywhere.

368
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,280
I don't want to...

369
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,720
mess with the river god.

370
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm giving you all a boat ride...

371
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,400
by putting my life at risk.

372
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,960
Hey, buddy,

373
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
there's no such thing like river god.

374
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
That's simply a superstition.

375
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,040
I didn't make that up.

376
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,680
I'm telling you.

377
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
One year,

378
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,560
there was a flood which came and went quickly.

379
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
Then, a huge fish skeleton...

380
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,920
was washed ashore.

381
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,520
All of the boatmen...

382
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,880
saw it as the incarnation of river god.

383
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
We even named him...

384
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,120
Dragon King of Iron Head.

385
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Since we...

386
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,920
couldn't get rid of it,

387
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,480
we decided to build a temple using its skeleton.

388
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,320
But the villagers didn't have money.

389
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
And then something happened.

390
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,240
A businessman came to our village.

391
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,520
He heard about it...

392
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,000
and decided to build the temple for us.

393
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,400
It's a blessing to us all.

394
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,200
Building a temple using the fish skeleton?

395
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,280
That's rare.

396
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,440
It's not.

397
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,680
There's a fish-skeleton temple...

398
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,880
at Tianjin.

399
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
Are its pillars made of the fish bones?

400
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,280
Is the fish head the entrance?

401
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
And is it for worshiping Dragon King?

402
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,240
That's right.

403
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,200
There's one at Tianjin?

404
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,160
I never heard of that one.

405
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,720
But it's similar to what you described.

406
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
That businessman...

407
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,280
said that he always needed to have boat rides...

408
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
because of work.

409
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,480
That's why he built the temple.

410
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Is the temple still around?

411
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,760
Yes.

412
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Where?

413
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,800
Where is it?

414
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,680
If we're going to pass by it,

415
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,800
we should check it out.

416
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
This temple...

417
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
is located at the mountain pass
of Dragon Ridge.

418
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,960
But it's been neglected for many years.

419
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,160
Why?

420
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,560
That businessman said that...

421
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,920
there was somewhere in the mountain
with good feng shui.

422
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,440
Building the temple there...

423
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
would bless us villagers.

424
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
And it's such a joke.

425
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
Nothing good ever happens...

426
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,880
after the temple was built.

427
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,680
God gives us rain as he pleases.

428
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,480
And a drought would go on for years.

429
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,720
That's right, we've been this drought for years.

430
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,040
It's been years since it rained.

431
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,200
We burned incense and presented offerings.

432
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
Nothing worked.

433
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,280
All of us thought that...

434
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,560
that businessman got the wrong feng shui.

435
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,200
We wanted to make him pay for it.

436
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
But he had ran away.

437
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
Since then,

438
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,400
we no longer worship the temple.

439
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,880
Don't worry,

440
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,640
we're not Dragon King believers.

441
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,240
We just want to...

442
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
check the temple out.

443
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,000
It's so strange.

444
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,960
Why are you saying so?

445
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,320
Think about it.

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,240
That businessman built that temple
using his own money.

447
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,640
Why didn't he build it by the river?

448
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,680
Why did he...

449
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,000
build it in the mountain?

450
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,400
That's not how feng shui works.

451
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,400
Moreover,

452
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,000
he said that was a place with good feng shui.

453
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
That's simply nonsense.

454
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
You're saying that...

455
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
He was a tomb raider.

456
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,520
He probably...

457
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,280
found a tomb here at Dragon Ridge.

458
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,720
Building the temple was just a pretext.

459
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,240
Actually, he was here to steal valuables.

460
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,480
The temple...

461
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,560
was simply a cover-up.

462
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,160
What's going on?

463
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,790
What's going on?

464
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,270
The river god is angry!

465
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,960
He's going to kill us all!

466
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,790
Son.

467
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,720
What's going on?

468
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,480
What's going on here?

469
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,310
Son.

470
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,550
Son. Don't be afraid.

471
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,590
Don't be afraid.

472
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,550
Dad.

473
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,400
River god, please don't be angry!

474
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,160
River god, please don't be angry!

475
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,110
What's that?

476
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,310
What?

477
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,750
Fatty!

478
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,720
Have you seen clearly what it is?

479
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,350
I can't see it!

480
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,070
It's black!

481
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,440
It's like a softshell turtle!

482
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,590
As big as a truck!

483
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,680
It's going to...

484
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,200
make this boat sink!

485
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,550
Get a tool!

486
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,310
Get a tool!

487
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,960
What?

488
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,200
I need the entrenching tool!

489
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,880
No matter what it is,

490
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,880
I'm sure it's wretch!

491
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,240
Okay!

492
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,920
Give it to me!

493
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,550
Go to the cabin now!

494
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay!
