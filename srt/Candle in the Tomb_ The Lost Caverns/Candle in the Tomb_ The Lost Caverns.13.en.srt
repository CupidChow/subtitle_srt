[Episode 13]

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,000
Old Jin,

4
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,160
Don't move.

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,600
Don't move.

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
Don't move.

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,030
Fatty,

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,710
Give me the shovel.

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,350
I...

10
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,600
Old Jin.

11
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,350
Old Jin.

12
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,280
Old Jin.

13
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,000
Who?

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,070
Don't move.

15
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,240
Don't move.

16
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,150
Don't move.

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,750
What?

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,670
What's going on?

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,680
Old Hu,

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,230
this place seems familiar.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Were we here before?

22
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,480
It seems to be the case.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,310
Check it out.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,070
Don't move.

25
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,280
If not, you might get killed.

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,790
Then what should we do now?

27
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,350
Let's go back.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,640
Go back?

29
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,000
We finally got out of there.

30
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,150
We'll get killed if we go back.

31
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,040
That's right.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,510
This sign

33
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,150
must be left here by the prospector.

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,350
According to the left-hand rule,

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,640
Going forward in one way,

36
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,870
there should be an exit.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,350
But none of them made it out alive.

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,790
That means it's a dead end.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,480
The only way...

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,070
is to go back.

41
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,680
I agree with Hu Ba Yi.

42
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,150
Let's go then.

43
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,000
Are we really doing this?

44
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,790
Eldest Brother.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,070
Catch up.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,470
It's full of spiders.

47
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,710
How can we get inside?

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,280
I'll go check it out,

49
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,190
Stay here.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,710
Wait for me.

51
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,280
How is it?

52
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,000
After going inside,

53
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,400
there is a tomb door on the right side.

54
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,870
It should be the exit.

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
But it's quite a distance to climb up.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,190
I need this.

57
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,120
Old Hu,

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
his explosive isn't useful at all.

59
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,150
Give it to him.

60
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,680
Eldest Brother.

61
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,030
Give it to him.

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,510
I'll go first. You get a shelter...

63
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
and wait for me.

64
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
Be careful.

65
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,310
OK.

66
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,000
Mr. Hu.

67
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm counting on you.

68
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,950
Don't worry.

69
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,120
Go now.

70
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,920
Go.

71
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,750
Go.

72
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,600
Go, Old Jin.

73
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,390
Go. Hurry.

74
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,310
Come on.

75
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,390
Old Hu.

76
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,950
Hu Ba Yi.

77
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Old Hu.

78
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,510
Over here.

79
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Old Hu.

80
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,680
Come up.

81
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,630
Come up.

82
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,160
Be quick.

83
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,120
Watch out.

84
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,510
Old Hu.

85
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,070
Here.

86
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,870
Old Hu,

87
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,950
What is this place?

88
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,950
How strong the radiation was

89
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,950
to make spiders so huge?

90
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,070
I think they stop chasing us.

91
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Why?

92
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,720
I don't know either.

93
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,800
Maybe there are other traps ahead.

94
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,670
We are lucky.

95
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,870
I hope we won't see these spiders again.

96
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,720
I think...

97
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,600
they were raised to guard the tomb.

98
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,870
That's why they dare not enter the tomb path.

99
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,670
That means...

100
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,200
we've got into the tomb path.

101
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,670
That sounds like Old Jin.

102
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,600
Help!

103
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,360
Old Jin.

104
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,630
Old Jin.

105
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,720
Mr. Jin.

106
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,510
Mr. Hu.

107
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,200
Old Jin.

108
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,870
Old Jin.

109
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,600
Who's that?

110
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,480
Old Jin.

111
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,080
Fatty.

112
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Come.

113
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,720
Get up.

114
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Where's Ma Da Dan?

115
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,440
Why are you here alone?

116
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,720
I did hope somebody would be with me.

117
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,480
At least I wouldn't be frightened.

118
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Look, this place is so dark, like a maze.

119
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,120
I was scared to death.

120
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
Stop and listen here.

121
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,600
Did you see Ma Da Dan?

122
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
No, I didn't.

123
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,080
That's great.

124
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,550
Let's get out of here

125
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
to get rid of them.

126
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,910
Who are you getting rid of?

127
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,870
Who else could be?

128
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,200
The spiders, of course.

129
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm warning you.

130
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,360
Don't play tricks.

131
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,030
Hurry up.

132
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,200
Go find the valuables.

133
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Is everyone here?

134
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,670
Eldest Brother,

135
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,150
Seventh Brother and Ninth Brother aren't here.

136
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,000
What about Li Chun Lai?

137
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
I guess...

138
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,120
they've been killed by those spiders.

139
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,030
When we are down here,

140
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,320
we survive with our skills...

141
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,910
and get valuables with luck.

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,870
No one else can help.

143
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
That won't do.

144
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,080
This place is quite complicated.

145
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,000
We need as many people as possible.

146
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,390
I'll go find him now.

147
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,240
I'll come with you.

148
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,870
Stop.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,840
None of us is going back.

150
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Aren't you...

151
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,960
afraid of being abandoned by your brothers?

152
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
That will never happen.

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,550
Who's that?

154
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,390
The entrance is gone.

155
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,720
The entrance is gone.

156
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,270
We can't get out.

157
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,720
You're very tough indeed.

158
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,790
Take your time.

159
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,720
I was running.

160
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,790
When I realized I was all alone,

161
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,270
I went back...

162
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,600
to look for you all.

163
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,870
But I hit a wall.

164
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,240
I was wondering why there was a wall.

165
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,790
I looked around the place...

166
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,600
and realized that we were there before.

167
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,480
And it's become a wall.

168
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
The entrance is gone.

169
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,200
What nonsense are you talking?

170
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,720
Why is the entrance gone?

171
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm telling you the truth.

172
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,550
Come, I'll show you.

173
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,670
Let's go and check it out.

174
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,360
Let's go.

175
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,080
Go.

176
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,270
Go.

177
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,030
Go.

178
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,630
Look.

179
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Here it is.

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,080
The entrance is gone.

181
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,000
The entrance is gone.

182
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,080
Did you make a mistake?

183
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,200
We got out of the spider cave.

184
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,720
There must be an entrance.

185
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,480
It's here.

186
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,840
He's right.

187
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
It's here.

188
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,360
Eldest Brother,

189
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,670
it's...

190
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,600
gone.

191
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,080
What happened?

192
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,080
How did the entrance turn into a wall?

193
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,480
Maybe we're trapped here
because this place is haunted.

194
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,270
Someone told me that...

195
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,320
people got trapped...

196
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,240
in an ancient tomb...

197
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,240
because it was haunted.

198
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
They would never get out of it.

199
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,670
Ghosts.

200
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,750
There're ghosts here.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,720
We're dead meat.

202
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,750
There're ghosts and big spiders here.

203
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,150
I will never get out of here.

204
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Stop crying.

205
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,270
Listen up.

206
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,270
You're scaring yourselves.

207
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,960
I've seen this before.

208
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,270
There's no such thing as a haunted ancient tomb.

209
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,390
It's all illusion.

210
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,480
Get it?

211
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,840
Fatty.

212
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,910
Look at the blood on his face.

213
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,270
Did the illusion make it?

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,150
He hit the wall,

215
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,630
so he's having an illusion.

216
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,630
The blood is probably an illusion too. You...

217
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,150
Are you sure we came in through this way?

218
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,120
Yes.

219
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,910
Is this tomb really haunted?

220
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,480
Where is the path?

221
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,360
Yeah,

222
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,000
we came from this way.

223
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
And the path is gone now.

224
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,240
There are no ghosts.

225
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,750
We humans always scare ourselves.

226
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,000
Fatty.

227
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,630
We can't take this path.

228
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,360
Stop wasting our time here.

229
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,480
Let's go find...

230
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,270
other exits.

231
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,240
Yes.

232
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,790
Deities and ghosts are afraid of baddies.

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,960
Eldest Brother.

234
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,120
pull yourself together.

235
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,510
No matter what it is,

236
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
I'll get rid of it.

237
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,510
Yes. That's right.

238
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,630
Like I said earlier,

239
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,630
I'd rather die...

240
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
than be poor.

241
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,360
Eldest Brother.

242
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,240
What? I'm not done yet.

243
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,150
They're gone.

244
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,480
Eldest Brother.

245
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,480
Catch up.

246
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,550
Go.

247
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,720
Go.

248
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,750
Go.

249
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,030
Old Hu,

250
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,750
look.

251
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,000
Take a torch and lead the way.

252
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes.

253
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,150
Face statues were popular
in the Western Zhou dynasty.

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,960
Look, cloud-and-thunder lines
were engraved on their ears.

255
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,910
Only Western Zhou dynasty did that.

256
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,960
On our way here,

257
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,480
I realized that the secret passage...

258
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,240
was made of stone pieces.

259
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,910
After the Han dynasty,

260
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,870
most tomb paths were made of fired tomb bricks.

261
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,640
Those made of stone pieces
were of the Pre-Qin dynasty.

262
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,440
That means you're right all along.

263
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,960
This is a tomb of the Western Zhou dynasty.

264
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,750
Li Chun Feng has nothing to do with it.

265
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,000
Old Hu.

266
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,960
Why is there a cave?

267
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,110
It's probably the Hall of Hell.

268
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,790
Hall of Hell?

269
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,070
What's your next plan?

270
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
I don't know yet.

271
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,270
Let's find out who the tomb owner is first.

272
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,070
Follow me.

273
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,000
Where's the coffin?

274
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,790
Isn't it the Hall of Hell?

275
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
Where's the coffin?

276
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,110
Search thoroughly.

277
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't miss out every single corner.

278
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,750
Got it.

279
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,110
What is this?

280
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,270
You don't know what this is?

281
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,640
It's an armillary sphere.

282
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,510
What is an armillary sphere?

283
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,590
I don't care about that.

284
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,720
I just want to know where the coffin is.

285
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,510
I'm looking for it.

286
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,720
Here's the thing.

287
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,920
Hall of Hell...

288
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,160
is a place...

289
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,480
to put the coffin of the tomb owner.

290
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,550
According to the Book of Burial,

291
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Hall of Hell is the core of a tomb.

292
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,790
Be it a solo burial or a group one,

293
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
the tomb owner must wear his burial outfit...

294
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,830
and rest in peace in his coffin.

295
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,550
I don't understand what you're saying.

296
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,750
Just tell me where the coffin is.

297
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,750
Look around you.

298
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,110
I think the tomb owner got it all arranged.

299
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,240
If you manage to open the right door,

300
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
you should be able to find the coffin.

301
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,480
Third Brother.

302
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,720
Got it.

303
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,830
Come here. Break the door.

304
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,960
You can't simply do that. There might be some trap.

305
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,310
You heard that.

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's an arrangement with some trap.

307
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,030
Use your brain.

308
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,510
I got it.

309
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,510
Old Hu,

310
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,480
should we leave now?

311
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,350
Not now,

312
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,790
let's see if there are any clues.

313
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,790
Sure.

314
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,070
Fatty,

315
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,550
don't touch anything.

316
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,310
Don't you believe me?

317
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,350
Old Hu,

318
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm confused.

319
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,310
What's wrong?

320
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,590
Tang civil servants wore
this kind of court dress.

321
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,400
I'm sure this is Li Chun Feng's tomb.

322
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,510
You're right.

323
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,590
Judging from its scale and structure,

324
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,070
this should be the tomb of some Tang nobleman.

325
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,440
It's rectangular and full of edges.

326
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,200
And the yurt-liked structure on it...

327
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,270
symbolizes the concept of
round sky and square earth.

328
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,350
Eldest Brother.

329
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,590
This way. Over here.

330
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,440
Eldest Brother.

331
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,240
I've just studied it.

332
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
The drawing on the wall...

333
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,070
is very interesting.

334
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,480
I'll explain it to you.

335
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,440
Look.

336
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,550
Down here...

337
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,200
is a bunch of children.

338
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,750
And up here...

339
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,030
is a bunch of women.

340
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,030
I think this drawing means that...

341
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,030
in the future,

342
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,880
you'll marry a bunch of women.

343
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,720
After that,

344
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,110
they'll give birth to a bunch of children.

345
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,830
I just want the coffin.

346
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,070
But the armillary sphere...

347
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,830
didn't exist at the Western Zhou dynasty.

348
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,000
And the weirder thing is that...

349
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,350
the statues and wooden bricks out there...

350
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,160
were made during the Western Zhou dynasty.

351
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,510
I guess we need to find
Li Chun Feng's coffin...

352
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,640
for the answer.

353
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,200
Do you think...

354
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,720
this is a fake tomb?

355
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,110
There is indeed a saying about that.

356
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,200
It's said that Cao Cao and Zhu Yuan Zhang...

357
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,590
made their own fake tombs.

358
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,440
But this is such a big tomb.

359
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,240
Li Chun Feng was a civil servant.

360
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,240
Don't you find it too extravagant?

361
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,960
Mr. Jin,

362
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,000
here's an old man holding an iron rod.

363
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,070
Could it be Jiang Zi Ya?

364
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,270
Jiang Zi Ya?

365
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,880
It could be Qin Shu Bao.

366
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,350
Maybe.

367
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,200
What?

368
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,790
Are you an idiot?

369
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,830
No, what I meant was that...

370
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,070
the owner of this tomb was very poor.

371
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,240
There's nothing valuable here.

372
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,030
It'd be great if it's Li Chun Feng's tomb.

373
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,160
He was a powerful official.

374
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,070
Surely he had many grave goods.

375
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,110
Fatty,

376
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,510
if you're interested in
studying cultural relics,

377
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,240
you should improve
your history knowledge first.

378
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,830
Li Chun Feng...

379
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,550
was an imperial historian,

380
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,640
at the fifth level.

381
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,310
Isn't it a high-ranking civil servant?

382
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,200
In our society, it's called director.

383
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,590
Director?

384
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,590
I thought...

385
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,830
Don't despise it.

386
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,000
It's a director after all.

387
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
We're just commoners,

388
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,200
not a director.

389
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,510
You're right.

390
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,550
We're simply lowly.

391
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,240
By the way,

392
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,550
you're truly a commoner.

393
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,030
If any of your ancestors...

394
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,920
was a director,

395
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,310
your ancestral grave would be full of treasure.

396
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,160
Am I right?

397
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,350
What are you looking at, Mr. Jin?

398
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,790
Fatty,

399
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,880
look at this.

400
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't think it is a fake tomb.

401
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,350
There must be other reasons.

402
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,510
Old Hu,

403
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
I'll show you something.

404
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,480
Follow me.

405
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,440
Old Hu,

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,480
take a look at this.

407
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,480
Some words on it.

408
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
It's the Book of Dragon Bones.

409
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,510
What book?

410
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,830
Nothing.

411
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,400
I think our foreign friend...

412
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,920
find the relief is incomprehensible.

413
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,750
Yes, she has never seen one before.

414
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,270
It's an old man carrying a tortoise.

415
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,550
Why is it incomprehensible?

416
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,750
There is a painting here.

417
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,240
Come, have a look at it.

418
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,960
Are these written words similar to
those on the one you have?

419
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm not sure yet.

420
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,510
Take a good look at it.

421
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,550
Third Brother, what are you doing?

422
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,830
Eldest Brother,

423
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,310
the founder has answered my prayers.

424
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,750
Eldest Brother, look at...

425
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
that child in the drawing.

426
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,550
What is he lighting? It's a bomb.

427
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,030
The founder is telling me...

428
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,110
to blow these walls up.

429
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,880
The valuables will be revealed then.

430
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,680
I've had enough of you.

431
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,920
Can't you stop talking about bombs?

432
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,030
Didn't your eldest brother ask you...

433
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,510
to use your brain?

434
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,000
You want to...

435
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,480
blow us all up?

436
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
You know nothing.

437
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,000
Bombs come with different sizes.

438
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,720
It's such a delicate matter.

439
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,790
No,

440
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,110
you can't blow it up.

441
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,680
Do you know what this is?

442
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,070
It's Tui Bei Drawing.

443
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,510
What drawing?

444
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,200
It's Tui Bei Drawing which can be
used to predict the future.

445
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,750
Is it valuable?

446
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,350
It's not about the money.

447
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,590
It's said that Emperor Taizong of Tang Li Shi Min...

448
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,110
ordered Li Chun Feng and Yuan Tian Gang...

449
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,200
to write a great book...

450
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,200
which could predict the destiny of Tang dynasty.

451
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,680
And it's called Tui Bei Drawing.

452
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,720
Each dynasty banned this book.

453
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,160
And it's been rewritten by others.

454
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,590
The original version...

455
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,270
is nowhere to be found now.

456
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,350
That's right.

457
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
The most reliable version now...

458
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,960
is the one annotated by Jin Sheng Tan,
a genius at the Ming dynasty.

459
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,030
And it was kept in the Qing palace...

460
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,680
until the International Legations
attacked the Forbidden City.

461
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,960
That's how commoners found it.

462
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,960
Besides, there are only sixty symbols.

463
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,590
I just counted them.

464
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,030
Here.

465
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,070
The original Tui Bei Drawing by Li Chun Feng...

466
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,240
contained sixty-four symbols.

467
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,680
There must be some other clues.

468
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,270
Here's the light.

469
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,070
It matches sixty-four hexagrams.

470
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,240
Mr. Hu,

471
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,310
look at this.

472
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,160
My founder,

473
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,920
please give me your blessing.

474
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,350
May it be a good explosion.

475
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,720
Look,

476
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,110
this must be the relief of...

477
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,350
Li Chun Feng and Yuan Tian Gang
presenting Tui Bei Drawing.

478
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,790
It is valuable.

479
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,110
Eldest Brother,

480
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,240
I think the old man up there...

481
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,830
is cleaning the old man down here.

482
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,400
The ancients were really something.

483
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,200
It can be taken down.

484
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,000
Fatty.

485
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,720
Fatty.

486
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,070
It's the only entrance.

487
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,880
Now, we're all trapped in here.

488
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,030
Didn't I ask you

489
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,270
not to touch anything?

490
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,510
You just can't change this habit, can you?

491
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,440
I...

492
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm touching the right thing, right?

493
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,310
Check it out.

494
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,240
Sure.

495
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,030
Be careful.

496
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,310
Old Hu,

497
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,400
what do you think?

498
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,400
It's easy-peasy.

499
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,030
Everything here is fake,

500
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,400
except the relief and this pen.

501
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,480
And the pen is a trap.

502
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,750
That's so easy.

503
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
You're just overreacting.

504
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,830
You might not right. I have never been wrong.

505
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,590
Eldest Brother,

506
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,920
there's a coffin in here.

507
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,310
Let's go.

508
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,550
Hu Ba Yi,

509
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,440
what are you doing? Hurry up.

510
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,510
Quick.

511
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,000
Luckily, I am fast.

512
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,920
Put it back.

513
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,200
Have you heard her?

514
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,200
Put it back.

515
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,400
OK.

516
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,550
OK. I'll put it back.

517
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,160
I will do that.

518
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,350
I'm doing it.

519
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,750
What a beautiful coffin.

520
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,270
There must be many valuables in it.

521
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,830
Open it.

522
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,510
OK.

523
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,270
Wait,

524
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,750
based on the rule of tomb raiding

525
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,830
before opening a coffin,

526
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,680
we must light a candle at the southeast side.

527
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,510
We can only open the coffin
if the candle isn't put out.

528
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,480
That's troublesome.

529
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,350
Open it.

530
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,750
