[Episode 5]

3
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,220
Where are they?

4
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,380
Where are they?

5
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,940
They just disappeared.

6
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,740
Come, let's take a look.

7
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,620
Let me ask you,

8
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,620
did you see three strangers here?

9
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,820
One is fat,

10
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,140
one is skinny...

11
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,222
and one is tall.

12
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:58,170
No.

13
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,500
Finally, we got rid of them.

14
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,260
It's just temporary.

15
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,660
If we want to be safe,
we must leave the county at once.

16
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,700
Hurry, let's go.

17
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,300
Let me tell you,

18
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,860
if we go to the pier and station,

19
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,020
it's like walking straight into the trap.

20
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,380
I think we should hide somewhere for a few days.

21
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,460
When they stop searching for us,

22
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,020
we'll find a way to leave this place.

23
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
It's easy for you to say that.

24
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,420
Where will we hide?

25
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,580
Wait.

26
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,580
Let me see.

27
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,660
What is this?

28
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
The Old man gave it to me.

29
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,780
There are directions in here.

30
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,100
The top is "Zhen", the bottom is "Kan".

31
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,180
"Zhen" means "move",
"Kan" means "danger".

32
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Move when there's danger.

33
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,180
This is teaching us to escape.

34
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Escape to?

35
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,500
According to the interpretation of
the hexagram, southwest is the best.

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,460
Let's head southwest then.

37
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,900
Wait.

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,460
There's more here.

39
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,940
"Hoping to cross the sea of woes..."

40
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,740
"and move to worship the immortals."

41
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
I get it.

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,180
He said we should worship an immortal.

43
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,980
to bless and protect us.

44
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,380
That is not right.

45
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,220
Isn't there one more at the bottom?

46
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,500
This is a Li hexagram.

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,980
Why is it a Li hexagram?

48
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,940
I don't understand it for now.

49
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,540
If you can't understand, forget it for now.

50
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,500
I think we should all head southwest.

51
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,500
We'll think about it on the way.

52
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,940
Fatty is right.

53
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,340
Look, back then...

54
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,700
when Liu Bei crossed Jiangdong,

55
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,940
Zhuge Liang gave him three pouches.

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,460
At the end,

57
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,740
he opened it one by one,

58
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,660
right?

59
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,100
Both of you, wait for me!

60
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,460
Miss, who are you looking for?

61
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,220
Hello, madam.

62
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,300
Are Hu Ba Yi and Wang Kai Xuan here?

63
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,180
They went out.

64
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,660
I think they won't be back for a while.

65
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,340
Thank you, madam.

66
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,100
You're welcome.

67
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,380
Miss, what are you doing?

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,380
Hello, sir.

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,540
I'm looking for someone.

70
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,940
Who are you looking for?

71
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,900
Professor Sun.

72
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,260
Do you have a recommendation letter?

73
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,900
Who recommended you here?

74
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
What recommendation letter?
What's its purpose?

75
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,220
Well...

76
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,020
Matchmaking.

77
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,340
You don't even know about
the recommendation letter...

78
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,380
but you want to go in?

79
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,020
Sir,

80
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,980
I flew here from the Unites States.

81
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,780
I am a friend of Professor Chen Yong Ren.

82
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,780
Miss,

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,820
you're a foreign visitor?

84
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,740
No wonder you don't know our rules.

85
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,540
Leave him a note.

86
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,380
I'll send it to Professor Sun.

87
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,260
When can I meet Professor Sun then?

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,420
I don't know about that.

89
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,660
This Professor Sun that you're looking for...

90
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,980
has a bad temper.

91
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,820
Whether he meets you or not,

92
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,780
it depends on his mood.

93
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,740
Professor Sun,

94
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,340
someone is here to see you downstairs.

95
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,500
Didn't I say I won't see anyone?

96
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,780
She came from the United States.

97
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,140
Even if the President of United States
is here, I won't see him.

98
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,340
Well...

99
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,780
She left you a note.

100
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
I'll leave it here.

101
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,540
You must be Professor Sun.

102
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,100
My name is Shirley Yang.

103
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,740
Professor Chen Yong Ren asked me to come.

104
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,780
You know this symbol, right?

105
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,580
On Uncle Chen's back,

106
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,540
red rash look exactly like this appeared.

107
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,100
Old Chen told you about it?

108
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,300
Yes.

109
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,980
Two years ago,

110
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,700
in a batch of oracle bones
found in Gulan County,

111
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,820
there was one turtle shell which was
the most well-preserved.

112
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,540
This symbol was engraved on it.

113
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,100
What word is this?

114
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
This isn't a word.

115
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,340
Although this symbol looks like
oracle bone script,

116
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,780
they are vastly different.

117
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,260
There are many coincidences in this world.

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,860
Some beans look like human heads.

119
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,980
That thing on Old Chen's back...

120
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,580
might be a coincidence.

121
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,340
It isn't serious, right?

122
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,580
Professor Sun,

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,780
I know you're an expert at...

124
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,500
researching ancient and mysterious symbols.

125
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,660
Last year,

126
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
In the ancient Egypt Pharaoh’s tomb,

127
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,660
a scepter was unearthed.

128
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,980
Experts all around the world were helpless.

129
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,900
Later on, because of you,

130
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,540
they managed to interpret it...

131
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,660
knowing it was legendary Scepter

132
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,380
of the Netherworld Ancient Egypt...

133
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Since you were willing to help them,

134
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,580
why won't you help your old friend?

135
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,220
I just want to know...

136
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,020
the words from the turtle shell
unearthed from Gulan County.

137
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,020
What do they mean?

138
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,100
It's not that I won't say it.

139
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,220
The information about these
ancient words are classified information.

140
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,140
Before we come to a definite conclusion,

141
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,980
we can't reveal it to the public.

142
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,700
Fine.

143
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,660
I won't force you.

144
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,700
However,

145
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,780
I have something to show you...

146
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
before you make a decision.

147
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,860
Old Hu,

148
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,820
why is Blind Chen helping us?

149
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,980
I don't know.

150
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,980
But judging from the situation,

151
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,580
he's right.

152
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,620
Hey,

153
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,180
can we rest for a bit?

154
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,100
I can't stand it anymore.

155
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,180
Old Jin,

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,620
you are too weak.

157
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,180
We should rest.

158
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,460
Not only him,

159
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,740
my stomach is empty.

160
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,380
My legs have cramps.

161
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,220
Finally, we found a place to rest.

162
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,860
Let's go.

163
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,700
Sir.

164
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,460
Sir.

165
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,820
Hello, sir.

166
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,700
We're travelling.

167
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,220
This is miles from anywhere.

168
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,620
Can we go in and drink some water?

169
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,980
Sir,

170
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,180
can you understand us?

171
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,180
Young man,

172
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,620
can you speak properly?

173
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,220
I do understand.

174
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,980
We're thirsty.

175
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,740
Hungry.

176
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,700
Tired.

177
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,460
We're not bad people.

178
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,220
Yes.

179
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,860
Have you seen...

180
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,620
a bad person that looks kind like me?

181
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,500
You don't look like a bad person, young man.

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,060
The two of you...

183
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
I am not sure.

184
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Come in.

185
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,860
Thank you.

186
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,420
Some dishes left from lunch.

187
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,580
I hope you won't mind.

188
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,380
Of course not.

189
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,940
Thank you.

190
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,860
Thank you, sir.

191
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,620
You're welcome.

192
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Both of you,

193
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,620
hurry and come over.

194
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,500
What are you doing? We're eating.

195
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,820
Hurry, come over.

196
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,340
I'll let you see something interesting.

197
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,660
Something interesting?

198
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,660
Dry, wet or interesting?

199
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,460
Are you okay?

200
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,900
Mr. Hu, look at this.

201
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,100
How is it?

202
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,660
This is good stuff.

203
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,620
Why is it buried here?

204
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,940
I think...

205
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,020
this is from the early Western Zhou Dynasty.

206
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,780
What a pity...

207
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,620
the words are all worn out.

208
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,220
That means...

209
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,020
there is a Western Zhou tomb nearby?

210
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,980
I realized you're an especially...

211
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,500
fast thinker regarding this.

212
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,220
Is it delicious?

213
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,180
Not bad.

214
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,540
It made my eyes teary.

215
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,660
Young men,

216
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,100
that is the tolite.

217
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,740
You should eat here.

218
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,380
Hurry up...

219
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,020
Sir,

220
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,100
in your tolite,

221
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,820
where did you get that footrest slab from?

222
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,500
It has been there since I was young.

223
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Back then,

224
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,580
a professor from Beijing...

225
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,140
said it was good stuff.

226
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,420
Though it's good, it can't be eaten.

227
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,700
So, I put it in the tolite.

228
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,260
Sir,

229
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,820
can I ask you a question?

230
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,780
Do you know who is Ma Da Dan?

231
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,180
Of course.

232
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,300
He...

233
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,580
and his workers...

234
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,860
came to Gulan County a few years back.

235
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,380
They came and bought a coffin shop.

236
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,180
He has a nickname,

237
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
the Devil Incarnate.

238
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
It was said that...

239
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,540
there was a coffin in his shop.

240
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,140
When Ma Da Dan hits the coffin,

241
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,020
someone in this village would die.

242
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,900
The harder he hits the coffin,

243
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,100
the further is the person who died.

244
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,140
If the coffin shop's business is bad,

245
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
he would hit the coffin.

246
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,300
Really?

247
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,380
That evil?

248
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,380
Then,

249
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,460
why didn't you destroy his coffin shop?

250
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
This is just a legend.

251
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,820
We don't have evidence,

252
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,460
how can we destroy his shop?

253
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,820
Why are you inquiring about him?

254
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,100
Nothing.

255
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,260
We're just asking around.

256
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,460
A friend of mine mentioned him before.

257
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,540
Where are you heading?

258
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,540
We're heading southwest.

259
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,780
Southwest?

260
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,500
To the ferry, right?

261
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,580
Be careful.

262
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Don't go deep into the caves.

263
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,020
Caves?

264
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,220
What caves?

265
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,180
The caves in front of Fish-skeleton Temple.

266
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,940
It looks like a normal mountain,

267
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,660
but you might accidentally...

268
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,300
fall into hollow earth.

269
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,820
If you fall in,

270
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,300
you won't be able to escape.

271
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,100
We locals...

272
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,900
call it

273
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,940
the Lost Caverns.

274
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,140
That place is mysterious.

275
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,900
You'll get lost in there during daytime.

276
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,260
There are many dirty things.

277
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,180
Many people died in there.

278
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,060
Last month, an exploration team...

279
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,740
came to find uranium.

280
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,420
After they went in,

281
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
they didn't come out.

282
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,660
None of them.

283
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,900
Mr. Hu,

284
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,820
are we on the right track?

285
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,980
There isn't even a path.

286
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,620
Fatty.

287
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
Enough, Mr. Jin.

288
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,860
Stop talking nonsense.

289
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,220
Just follow Old Hu.

290
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,340
Moreover,

291
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,500
you're weak.

292
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,220
We walked for just a while,

293
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,740
but you're already tired.

294
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,460
Can my body...

295
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,460
be compared with the both of you?

296
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,220
In Beijing,

297
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,100
I only get in and out of bed.

298
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,340
Fine.

299
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
You are...

300
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,700
wasting your life in bed.

301
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,100
Well,

302
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,620
let me catch my breath.

303
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,420
Aren't we breathing?

304
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,700
We'd be dead if we aren't breathing.

305
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,460
No.

306
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,900
There isn't even a path.

307
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,220
This is killing me.

308
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,820
Well,

309
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,540
we have been walking for quite a distance.

310
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,180
Are we in the right direction, Mr. Hu?

311
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,700
I think so.

312
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,180
Looks like...

313
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,260
that Blind Chen is really helping us.

314
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,100
He pointed us the route to the ferry.

315
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,860
What is that poem...

316
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,220
that told us to worship immortals?

317
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,700
"Hoping to cross the sea of woes..."

318
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,860
"and move to worship the immortals."

319
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,700
That means when we pass Fish-skeleton Temple,

320
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,980
we should head in and pray.

321
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,940
Pray? Where is the immortal?

322
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,180
Hey,

323
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,820
isn't that Fish-skeleton Temple?

324
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,060
There.

325
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,820
That one.

326
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,900
Am I right?

327
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,700
If this Fish-skeleton Temple
is a Fengshui paradise,

328
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,500
I will go back...

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,820
and burn "The 16 Words
Yin & Yang Occult".

330
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,500
What's wrong? Isn't this place good?

331
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,060
Look at the wind blowing.

332
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
There is wind.

333
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,380
Yes, this place doesn't have water.

334
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,500
If there's a huge river...

335
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,500
with water flowing,

336
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,580
this place would be a Fengshui paradise.

337
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,220
No matter how many rivers are here,
this isn't a Fengshui paradise.

338
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,900
Compared with houses and tombs,
building temples...

339
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,460
are different.

340
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,740
Building temples is benefiting others.

341
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,300
So, the place to build a temple...

342
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,860
should be surrounded by mountains
and Mingshan Hall.

343
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,420
There's a saying that goes,

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,100
"you can't build a temple
in the mountains."

345
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,780
Except this Fish-skeleton Temple,

346
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
have you seen any temple built in the ravine?

347
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,500
Even earth temples...

348
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,900
aren't built in a deep ravine.

349
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,060
That means...

350
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,740
you got it right.

351
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,260
This Fish-skeleton Temple...

352
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,540
belongs to the grave robbers.

353
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,340
They built it to hide it from others.

354
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,660
Let's head there and take a look.

355
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,860
What if at the bottom, there is...

356
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,180
Stop talking nonsense?

357
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,580
Do you want to die?

358
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,500
Ma Da Dan will be here soon.

359
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,340
Moreover,

360
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,580
in this kind of place,

361
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,140
even if there's a tomb,

362
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,060
it won't be from a rich family.

363
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,860
It would be robbed empty.

364
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,500
Let's go.

365
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,460
This isn't right.

366
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,180
This person who built this temple is an expert.

367
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,380
I have to look at it from a higher altitude.

368
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,860
This isn't high enough?

369
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,860
The both of you,

370
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
should go ahead.

371
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,740
I need to take a break.

372
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,660
It's fine, Mr. Jin.

373
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,980
Just follow me.

374
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,940
I'll accompany...

375
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,460
This is too high.

376
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,940
Old Hu, slow down.

377
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:44,980
Slow down...

378
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,220
Old Hu.

379
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,540
You've been staring at it.

380
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,180
What did you discover?

381
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,860
There is a saying in Finding Dragons:

382
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,660
dozens of mountains and rivers,

383
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,500
countless dragon halls.

384
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
The Dragon Ridge...

385
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
looks like a winding mountain range.

386
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,980
But the surface is too fragmented.

387
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,260
It's there but useless.

388
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,740
The momentum is lost.

389
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,140
I don't understand.

390
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,220
There is a grave here,

391
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,780
but it won't be a big one.

392
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,740
Why did he take troubles...

393
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,180
to build a temple here?

394
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,340
Old Hu,

395
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,220
it's too high, are we really going up?

396
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,340
Old Hu.

397
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,060
Maybe a businessman...

398
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,420
built this temple out of kindness.

399
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,460
Can't he accidentally do so out of kindness?

400
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
Where are you going?

401
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,620
Old Hu...

402
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,340
I have to stop. It's too high.

403
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,900
I'll stop here. I won't follow you.

404
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,180
Got it.

405
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,580
Although the mountains around here are so barren...

406
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,820
without any barriers

407
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,380
and don't even have a bit momentum,

408
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,220
there are clouds hidden on the top

409
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,460
and a place to stay deep down there.

410
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,180
It's peaceful and tranquil.

411
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,300
Wow,

412
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,100
what an expert.

413
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,620
It's high.

414
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,380
Can we leave?

415
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,660
Mr. Hu.

416
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,900
What's wrong?

417
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,700
We should leave.

418
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,060
Why did you go there?

419
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,020
I took the wrong path.

420
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,020
Hurry, let's go!

421
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,180
Old Jin!

422
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,020
Old Jin!

423
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,620
Oh, no.

424
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,580
Mr. Hu,

425
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,260
hurry!

426
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,300
Old Jin, Hang in there!

427
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,340
We're here!

428
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,400
Old Jin, don't move! Or you'll falling faster.

429
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,700
Old Jin, I'll find some tools!

430
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,260
Old Hu!

431
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,900
Fatty!

432
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,580
I don't want to die!

433
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,740
Old Jin, hang on!

434
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,700
Wait for me!

435
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,180
Fatty,

436
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,660
give me your hand!

437
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,900
Hang on!

438
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,220
Old Jin!

439
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,100
Fatty, hang on!

440
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,940
I'll save Old Jin!

441
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,060
Old Hu!

442
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,460
I...

443
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,500
Fatty!

444
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,900
What sound is it?

445
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,580
Where is this?

446
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,340
Why am I here?

447
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,180
It's me, Fatty.

448
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,260
Old Hu.

449
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,740
Why are you here too?

450
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,260
How could I leave you alone here?

451
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,660
Come on, slowly.

452
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,500
Slowly...

453
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,580
Are you fine?

454
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,660
I'm fine, but my butt hurt.

455
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,420
Don't press...

456
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,900
It hurts! Don't press on me!

457
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,500
Let's go.

458
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,660
I almost died after falling down.

459
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Old Jin!

460
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,900
I can't do it anymore.

461
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,380
Use all your strength.

462
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Old Jin!

463
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,820
I can't, my butt hurts.

464
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,900
What are you doing?

465
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
I told you to shout,

466
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,740
why are you acting like this?

467
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,060
Like what?

468
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,780
Is that Old Jin?

469
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,580
Looks like someone did something to him.

470
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

471
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
Old Jin!

472
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
Old Jin!

473
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,820
It hurts.

474
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,980
This way.

475
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,340
Old Jin!

476
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,900
Slowly.

477
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,140
What is this place?

478
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,340
Old Jin.

479
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,820
Old Jin.

480
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,260
These are Old Jin's shoe prints, right?

481
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,460
What is this?

482
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,580
These are teeth marks.

483
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,380
Why is he rolling on the floor?

484
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,220
Escaping?

485
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,300
He's escaping.

486
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
Old Jin!

487
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,820
Here.

488
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,260
Old Jin!
