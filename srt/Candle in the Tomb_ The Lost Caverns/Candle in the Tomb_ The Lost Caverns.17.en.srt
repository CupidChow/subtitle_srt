00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,660
The good things are coming out.

4
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,100
They're all here.

5
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,020
All the good things are here.

6
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,660
Mr. Jin,

7
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,220
how many imported cars can we
get from selling all these?

8
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,020
Can you figure out how to get out first?

9
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,420
Don't touch anything.

10
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,300
Why?

11
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,740
Any mechanisms?

12
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,500
We might get killed if you do.

13
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,260
Fatty, you forget why we came here?

14
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,500
Yes,

15
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,460
we're here to look for the Book of Dragon Bones.

16
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,700
I can only look at it without touching?

17
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,980
Why isn't the book here?

18
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,980
That's right.

19
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,940
where is the book?

20
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,180
Stop looking for it.

21
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,900
I'm sure it isn't here.

22
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,660
The structure of this tomb...

23
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,660
is like that of Qimen Dunjia.

24
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,700
These eight walls represent...

25
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,220
the Eight Doors. They're Rest, Life, Harm,
Delusion, Scenery, Death, Fear, and Open.

26
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,700
We need to unlock this mechanism...

27
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,260
to get the Book of Dragon Bones.

28
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,380
What? Eight mechanisms?

29
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,980
I know a little about the Eight Doors.

30
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,220
Aren't they doors of life and death?

31
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,180
And the door of life will get us out of here, right?

32
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,220
It's not that easy.

33
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,940
Those who know a little about Qimen Dunjia...

34
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,060
think that the door of life is the solution.

35
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,100
However, that would fall into his trap.

36
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,820
Falling into a trap?

37
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,180
Judging from the mechanisms we've had,

38
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,980
the tomb owner didn't kill us directly,

39
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,620
but he definitely wouldn't let us get out of here.

40
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,260
Then, what should we do?

41
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,220
According to the definitions of
Nine Palaces and Eight Doors,

42
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,260
we should look for...

43
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,700
the grave goods which represent the Eight Doors...

44
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,220
to unlock the mechanism.

45
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,820
I know something about the Eight Doors.

46
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,940
Open, Rest, and Life are
The Three Auspicious Doors.

47
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,540
Death, Fear, and Harm are
The Three Inauspicious Doors.

48
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,180
Delusion and Scenery are
The Neutral Doors.

49
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,100
But which are the right grave goods?

50
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,620
The theory of Eight Doors...

51
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,220
originated in...

52
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,980
the theory of Nine Palaces.

53
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,620
They're interrelated.

54
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,780
In what way?

55
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,180
Nine Palaces, as argued in
the Nine Parts of Mathematics,

56
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,900
indicate the nine positions...

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,980
at which Qimen Dunjia's Eight Doors...

58
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,380
were placed.

59
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,500
The Abysmal-Rest Door at the First Palace.

60
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,980
The Receptive-Death Door
at the Second Palace.

61
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,780
The Arousing-Harm Door
at the Third Palace.

62
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,380
The Gentle-Delusion Door
at the Fourth Palace.

63
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,180
The Fifth Palace in the center.

64
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,940
The Creative-Open Door
at the Sixth Palace.

65
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,620
The Joyous-Fear Door
at the Seventh Palace.

66
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,100
The Keeping Still-Life Door
at the Eighth Palace.

67
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,020
The Clinging-Scenery Door
at the Ninth Palace.

68
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,820
These are the Nine Palaces and Eight Doors.

69
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,500
But it's not indicated...

70
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,340
which doors are of auspicious.

71
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,020
How do we locate...

72
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,660
the positions of Nine Palaces and Eight Doors?

73
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,940
That's easy.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,020
Here's a mantra.

75
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,700
Two and four are shoulders. Six and eight are legs.

76
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,020
Three on the left and seven on the right.
Nine as a hat and one as the shoes.

77
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,260
And five at the centre.

78
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,380
What...

79
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,340
what is it?

80
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,140
Number.

81
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,900
What's the meaning?

82
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,820
Number.

83
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,140
I still don't get it.

84
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,100
Old Hu,

85
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,700
can you be more humble?

86
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,140
Say something we all can understand.

87
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,020
I'll put it this way.

88
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,100
The coffin in the tomb,

89
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,580
its head always faces the door.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,900
Nine as a hat and one as the shoes,

91
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,340
means nine is his head...

92
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
and one is his feet.

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,820
In that case, the head represents Clinging...

94
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,580
and feet Abysmal.

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,140
The head is between the shoulders.

96
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,020
And on the feet are the legs.

97
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,020
Therefore, Clinging is between
Gentle and Receptive.

98
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,900
And Abysmal is between
Keeping Still and Creative.

99
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,020
Three on the left and seven on the right.

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,580
The Arousing Third Door is on the left.
The Joyous Seventh Door is on the right.

101
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,820
And that's what we're looking for,

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Nine Palaces and Eight Doors.

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,900
The Abysmal-Rest Door at the First Palace.

104
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,340
Mr. Hu,

105
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,140
didn't you say that Abysmal means water?

106
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,140
This bronze statue has nothing to do with water.

107
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,460
Abysmal as water is just a representation.

108
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,820
Based on the hexagram theory, Abysmal...

109
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,500
forms the centre.

110
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,580
Be good and pure-hearted.

111
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,700
This bodhisattva statue...

112
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,500
is covered with wreaths...

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,380
with a Vairocana's crown on his head.

114
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,020
This is Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.

115
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,340
I once read that Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva...

116
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,100
saved his suffering mother from hell.

117
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
And he swore that...

118
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,580
he wouldn't be a Buddha
until everyone was free from hell.

119
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,020
And this carries the same meaning.

120
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,140
Self-sacrifice for the sake of others.

121
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,580
A great merciful act.

122
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
That it is!

123
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,380
That sounds logical if you put it that way.

124
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,100
What's wrong?

125
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,900
I think this mechanism is too simple.

126
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,900
Am I overthinking it?

127
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,460
Life and death...

128
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,380
is always...

129
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
a gamble.

130
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm giving my odds to you.

131
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,420
Watch out!

132
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,220
Old Hu.

133
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,940
why are we so lucky?

134
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,220
We're getting what we ask for.

135
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,460
What's the situation? It's not the right one?

136
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,300
It's probably a timer.

137
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,220
We must unlock the other seven doors,

138
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,700
before it goes back into the wall.

139
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,700
Old Hu, what do we do?

140
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,700
Find the grave goods for
Nine Palaces and Eight Doors.

141
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,580
Hurry up.

142
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,580
-Quick.
-Hurry up.

143
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,220
Mr. Jin, we're counting on you.

144
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,940
Jump.

145
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,460
Mr. Jin, I'm feeling dizzy.

146
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,740
Jump.

147
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,820
Brother.

148
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,820
what to do now?

149
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,180
Damn it.

150
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,340
Is it trying to kill us?

151
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,700
What are you doing?

152
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,820
Listen up.

153
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,940
The Eight Palaces represent

154
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Heaven, Ground, Water, Fire,
Wind, Thunder, Mountain, and Marsh.

155
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Find the goods based on this logic.

156
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,460
Wind, look for Wind.

157
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:23,860
Wind.

158
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,460
Fine Wind.

159
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,300
Old Hu,

160
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,220
look.

161
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,060
Ma Da Dan, help us...

162
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,340
to look for the good for Mountain.

163
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,460
Got it.

164
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,700
Thunder is up there.

165
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,100
Only this Western Zhou Li Gui...

166
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,980
was with cloud-thunder lines.

167
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,340
It should be the one.

168
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,740
So many of them. How can we find them?

169
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,220
Quick.

170
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,940
Old Hu.

171
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,180
Old Hu.

172
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,940
didn't you say we need to find all eight goods?

173
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Why did it stop moving?

174
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,620
Why is it moving again?

175
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,940
It can only buy us some time.

176
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,220
Keep looking for the other six goods.

177
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,420
I can check goods,

178
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,580
but I don't know

179
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,100
which goods is for Wind.

180
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,540
Brother, what's that?

181
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
I've found the one for Mountain.

182
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,820
Fourth Brother, get me up there.

183
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,580
Got it.

184
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,460
Brother, go.

185
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,300
Go help Mr. Jin.

186
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,940
OK.

187
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,860
How is it going?

188
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,340
I really don't know how to identify them.

189
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,420
Look carefully.

190
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
I did.

191
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,300
And this looks like a mountain.

192
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,460
Should we turn it?

193
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,220
Wait.

194
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,340
Corals live in water.

195
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,100
It's the opposite of a mountain keeping still.

196
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,580
No.

197
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
A stone gives birth to a jade,
being still as a mountain.

198
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,300
This jade dog is the right good, not the coral.

199
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,460
Old Hu.

200
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,580
Old Hu.

201
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,540
Old Hu.

202
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,300
Hold it tight.

203
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,940
You can survive if you let me go.

204
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,540
Stop talking.

205
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,820
The rope is going to break.

206
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,540
No way,

207
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,100
the rope will break soon.

208
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,580
Let go of your hand, they'll pull you up.

209
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,860
Swing to the wall first.

210
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,580
Fatty, hold it tight.

211
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,300
We did.

212
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,860
Fatty, it's moving again.

213
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,420
Old Hu.

214
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,060
Old Hu, what now?

215
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,180
We're safe for now.

216
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,820
But we can't hold on for long.

217
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,820
Hang in there.

218
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm coming down to save you.

219
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,060
You should unlock the mechanism first,

220
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,940
otherwise, all of us will die.

221
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,100
I'll think of a way to get up there.

222
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,700
Fatty,

223
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,220
you and Mr. Jin go unlock the mechanism.

224
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
I'll deal with Old Hu.

225
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,180
Fine. Hang in there, Old Hu.

226
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,420
Old Hu,

227
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,060
do you know rock climbing?

228
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,580
Who?

229
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,940
Who's Pan Yan?
(Pronounced the same with  rock climbing in Chinese)

230
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,060
Listen here.

231
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm going to teach you how to
rock climb barehanded.

232
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
And then climb up yourself.

233
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,580
Climb?

234
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,740
This place is smooth like a fish bowl.

235
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,060
How can I climb?

236
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,460
If not,

237
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,420
you'll only fall down.

238
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,100
Relax your body.

239
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,620
Mind the distance between
your body and the rock face.

240
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,460
Swing your legs out and
get close to the rock face.

241
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,100
Use your feet to stabilize your body.

242
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,420
Don't just depend on your arms,

243
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,820
otherwise, you can't hold on for long.

244
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,740
I'll go look for a suitable climbing path.

245
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Hang in there.

246
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,220
Old Hu, I've found it.

247
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,940
There is no way to climb up directly.

248
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,460
You need to climb from the bottom of Life Door,

249
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,940
turn left and climb to the bottom of Rest Door.

250
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,340
Guide us.

251
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,580
There's a protruding rock on your left.

252
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,300
Make it your next landing point.

253
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,820
Put your right leg behind the left one.

254
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,940
That'll give you more energy.

255
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,300
The center of gravity can't be too high,
or you'll fall.

256
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,060
Keep your eyes on the landing point.

257
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,980
Step on it using your tiptoe.

258
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,300
And don't use your sole.

259
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,820
Use your leg well.

260
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,820
Old Hu,

261
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,100
Mr. Jin said Delusion Door was a wooden screen.

262
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,980
Is it right?

263
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,500
Is it wooden?

264
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,580
Yes, a miniature screen
made of golden thread wood.

265
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,540
Am I right, Mr. Hu?

266
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,820
Gentle is the wood and wind.

267
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,180
This is it.

268
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,580
Fine, I'll move it now.

269
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,740
Quick.

270
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,620
Old Jin, it's stopped moving. Jump now.

271
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,540
Jump.

272
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,100
Jump.

273
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,860
Fatty,

274
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,580
The Clinging Palace is of fire.

275
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,340
Go find goods related to fire.

276
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,100
Sure.

277
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,580
Chief Yang will deal with the Scenery Door.

278
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,300
Mr. Jin and I will deal with the Death Door.

279
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,180
It's moving again. Find them now.

280
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,100
Stay focus.

281
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,540
The center of gravity is too high.

282
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,100
Fold your right leg,

283
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,820
as if kneeling on one knee.

284
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Cling to the wall.

285
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,660
Forget about it,

286
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,300
go unlock the Scenery Door now.

287
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,340
Sure.

288
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,100
Fire.

289
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,300
Here's a candlestick with
a Vermilion Bird on top of it.

290
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,100
What else?

291
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,100
There is a red painted box with dragon pattern...

292
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,260
and a bronze sword.

293
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,580
That's the Vermilion Bird.

294
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,300
Mr. Jin, which one should we choose?

295
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
If Creative were of yang,
Receptive would be of yin.

296
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,020
Look at this bloodstone.

297
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,260
It's formed after the yin female body was rotten...

298
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,420
and the rotten blood flew into the stone.

299
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,100
It looks like...

300
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,340
Yes, I'll turn it.

301
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,580
No rush.

302
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,540
Look at that.

303
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,340
Receptive represents femininity.

304
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,820
And this Topaz Goddess...

305
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,860
is a woman.

306
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,500
Fine.

307
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,980
This one too.

308
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,100
Fine, I'll go.

309
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,300
Wait.

310
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,180
What?

311
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,860
I find this one more reliable.

312
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,620
Please take a look at it.

313
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,260
Fine, I'll turn it.

314
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,060
Don't move.

315
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,140
Mr. Jin,

316
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,380
this is a critical time.

317
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,820
Can you make up your mind?

318
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,740
I'm not sure which one.

319
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,820
Should we turn both of them?

320
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,340
Can we?

321
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,620
No. No way.

322
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,580
No path ahead. How do I do now?

323
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,500
Wait.

324
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,500
Let me look for it.

325
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,620
Wait.

326
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,540
can I reach the Door at the Sixth Palace

327
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,340
by jumping onto that stone?

328
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,260
No, that's too far.

329
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,540
Can you reach it...

330
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,820
by stepping on me?

331
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,740
He's not professionally trained.

332
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,740
He can't support you.

333
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,300
Do something,

334
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,620
otherwise, we're going to die.

335
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,860
Come on.

336
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,020
Ma Da Dan,

337
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,180
hang in there.

338
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
It seems that I'm...

339
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,540
meeting my late brothers soon.

340
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,340
Ma Da Dan, hang in there.

341
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,260
Cross your legs and swap your foot points.

342
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
Turn around and squat.

343
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,580
Move the center of gravity behind.

344
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,980
Use the protruding rock to do it.

345
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,820
You can maintain it for another ten minutes.

346
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,900
Finally,

347
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,100
I've made it up here.

348
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,900
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

349
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,580
Catch that one!

350
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,540
Yes, this is it.

351
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,540
-This one.
-Okay.

352
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,380
Mr. Jin,

353
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
get me up there.

354
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,860
I can't.

355
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,540
Fine,

356
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,580
I'll get you up there now.

357
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,820
Old Jin, you'll deal with it.

358
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,260
I'll deal with the next one.

359
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,780
Mr. Jin, hang in there. I'll help you.

360
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,780
Let me carry you.

361
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Leave me alone.

362
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,340
I'll just be here.

363
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,820
I'm fine here.

364
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,580
Turn that bloodstone now.

365
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
That one.

366
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,780
Stand still.

367
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,140
Old Hu,

368
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,820
Joyous is the water.

369
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,860
It means this flagon, right?

370
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,060
Not that one.

371
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,580
Marsh is metallic, not watery.

372
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,620
Then, which one?

373
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,540
Joyous is the marsh and young girl.

374
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,940
Joyous is the marsh and young girl.

375
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,460
It's gold.

376
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,820
Gold.

377
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,260
Here's a golden statue.

378
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,540
This one?

379
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,780
Don't touch it.

380
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,820
Yes.

381
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,460
It's that goat vase.

382
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,500
How does a goat have anything to do gold?

383
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,500
Move it now, trust me.

384
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,100
Goat.

385
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,740
This is it.

386
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,580
This is it.

387
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,820
Help me.

388
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,620
Give me a hand.

389
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,780
Are you alright?

390
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,500
I'm good.

391
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,020
Old Jin,

392
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,100
how is it there?

393
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,180
Don't worry,

394
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,420
everything's good here.

395
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,540
Old Hu,

396
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,380
my gosh.

397
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
You're so lucky.

398
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,340
It's not all about luck.

399
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
The ancients saw...

400
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,060
the goat as a gentle yet strong animal.

401
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,780
In a chapter from Yi Jing titled Zhaonan,

402
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,580
it's said that King Wen of Zhou...

403
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,780
was honest and just,

404
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,580
as good as a goat.

405
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,500
That's why I picked this goat vase.

406
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,900
Founder blesses us.

407
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,300
What's inside?

408
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
A tortoise shell.

409
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,260
Book of Dragon Bones.

410
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,500
A tortoise shell.

411
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,820
Old Hu, it's the Book of Dragon Bones.

412
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,100
We've found it.

413
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,180
We've found it.

414
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,500
Old Hu,

415
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,900
since we're here,

416
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,580
why don't we open the coffin...

417
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,620
and see if there's anything valuable in it?

418
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,500
Can we?

419
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,380
No.

420
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,660
We can't do that.

421
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,260
The coffin owner must be a capable man.

422
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,780
He didn't seize the book...

423
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
by making it his grave good.

424
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,340
Besides,

425
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,740
he left us clues to all the mechanisms...

426
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
and led us to the book.

427
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,980
Let's not do that.

428
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,980
We shouldn't disturb him.

429
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,100
Then, who is he?

430
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,500
It doesn't matter who he is.

431
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,980
We just need to respect him, get it?

432
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,260
Fine,

433
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,380
no matter what's inside the coffin,

434
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,580
surely it's not as good as
the Book of Dragon Bones.

435
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
That's right.

436
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,180
How much does it worth?

437
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,620
It's priceless.

438
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,500
Getting married.

439
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,180
Having a child.

440
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,540
It's a dream come true.

441
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,980
It's useful to us only.

442
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,060
it is worthless for others.

443
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,980
You think I'm stupid?

444
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,020
You're all stupid.

445
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,580
God bless me.

446
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,260
He gave me...

447
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,740
the most valuable thing in this world.

448
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
And...

449
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,420
you all are going to die.

450
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,180
It's mine.

451
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,340
What are you doing?

452
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,820
You coward, what are you doing?

453
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,780
Get married.

454
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,820
Get a wife.

455
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,860
Stop!

456
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,580
Get a wife.

457
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,060
Stop!

458
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,300
Stop!

459
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,300
Stop!

460
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,340
Get back and get married. Get a wife.
