00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,020
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,700
No!

4
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,860
No!

5
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,140
My fault.

6
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,860
It's all my fault.

7
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,100
No.

8
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,260
If you didn't take me along,

9
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,620
this wouldn't have happened.

10
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,420
It's all my fault.

11
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,940
My fault.

12
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,220
It's all my fault.

13
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,540
It seems...

14
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,380
the two of us...

15
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,180
have to say goodbye now.

16
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,060
I'm dying.

17
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,500
You shouldn't get involved.

18
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,380
I was dying.

19
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,140
But you saved me with your life.

20
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,380
Both of us want to die for a cause.

21
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
So why fear death?

22
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Unfortunately,

23
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,580
I haven't passed you...

24
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,820
the Tomb Calming Skill.

25
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,420
Go see Golden Abacus.

26
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,580
He's dressed like a merchant...

27
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,900
and is active around Yellow River.

28
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,940
He's good at astrology and Feng Shui.

29
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,380
He's as good as my master,

30
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,780
Zhang San Lian Zi.

31
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,100
Take this...

32
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,220
Mojin Talisman.

33
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,660
No!

34
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,620
No!

35
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,900
No!

36
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,140
Since then,

37
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,980
Zhe Gu Shao searched through
both coasts of Yellow River.

38
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,460
Neither he found
Mojin Xiaowei and Golden Abacus

39
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,700
nor interpreted the mysterious
language on the tortoise shell.

40
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,740
At the chaotic time,

41
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,260
Zhe Gu Shao was in despair.

42
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,660
So he accepted Thomas' invitation...

43
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,980
to migrate.

44
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,260
And then,

45
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,820
my grandfather lived in Tennessee.

46
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,580
He founded a trading company,

47
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,700
and never cared for this matter anymore.

48
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,460
Your grandfather is a true hero.

49
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,420
He used his whole life...

50
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,380
to look for the Dust Bead.

51
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,300
Dust Bead? Phoenix Stone?

52
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,220
I thought it was just a folklore,

53
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,700
something untrue.

54
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,420
I wanted to...

55
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,140
know more about the two of them.

56
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,820
But I didn't expect...

57
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,940
this incident happened to you.

58
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,540
What did you say?

59
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,900
Incident happened to us?

60
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,100
In short,

61
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,060
the bead hasn't been found, right?

62
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,660
What's the use of your clue?

63
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,740
Ms. Yang.

64
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,260
I understand your illness is heritable.

65
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,140
But how did Fatty and I get it?

66
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,220
I suspect that...

67
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,260
Dust Bead has appeared in Haunted Cave.

68
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,180
The pathogen is in the air.

69
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,820
Coincidentally, two of you were injured.

70
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,660
That's why you were infected.

71
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,900
As what you said,

72
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,420
Dust Bead isn't something precious.

73
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,460
It's just the source of pathogen.

74
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,300
Many experts think so.

75
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,500
But because no one has seen Dust Bead,

76
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,140
no one can be sure.

77
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,180
Can't this disease be cured?

78
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,820
My grandfather has tried many ways,

79
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,140
but none worked.

80
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,620
Even when iron is injected into the body,

81
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,260
it'll be denied by the body...

82
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,780
because of the pathogen.

83
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,180
So only by finding the source of the pathogen

84
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,740
to understand its characteristic,

85
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,580
we can find a way to solve this.

86
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,660
No matter what,

87
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,620
we have to first find Dust Bead.

88
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,780
No matter what we do, we'll die.

89
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
I've wasted my time listening to you.

90
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,420
Fatty, let's pack up and leave.

91
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,220
No, no.

92
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,100
What's going on?

93
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,460
Don't stop me.

94
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,140
Mr. Hu, aren't we looking for Dust Bead?

95
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,220
What for?

96
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,220
Why waste the effort?

97
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,300
We should just...

98
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,700
go back and live some good years.

99
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,100
We'll die anyways.

100
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,300
What's the point?

101
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,420
Fatty.

102
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,420
Don't blame the others, blame me instead.

103
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,460
I've got you involved.

104
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,860
Let's use this one.

105
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,060
What's going on?

106
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,660
What are you doing? You're always scaring me.

107
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,380
What are you doing?

108
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,420
I want to slap myself.

109
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:57,900
No.

110
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,140
Old Hu, listen,

111
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,620
you have to calm down now.

112
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,100
Let go.

113
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,780
No. It has happened.

114
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,860
We should look for the medicine and treatment.

115
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,060
Why are you so anxious?

116
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,380
Let's listen to them first.

117
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,540
I've listened to them.

118
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,260
This American girl is fooling us.

119
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,740
She wants you to die, get it?

120
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,580
Why did you change your words?

121
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,220
None of your business.

122
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
This sentence remains.

123
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,020
Old Hu, I think,

124
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,900
Ms. Yang isn't someone like that.

125
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,460
Right?

126
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,140
Listen,

127
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,580
she came all the way to see us.

128
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,420
What does she want?

129
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,940
There's definitely a way.

130
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,860
Really?

131
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,380
Yes.

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,060
Are you sure?

133
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,540
Of course.

134
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,740
Do you really mean that?

135
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,580
Yes, I do.

136
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,860
Okay.

137
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Sorry, Ms. Yang.

138
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,900
Let's carry on.

139
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,900
Mr. Hu, what are you doing?

140
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,900
What do you mean?

141
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,540
If I hadn't ranted for you,

142
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,140
you would talk more nonsense than me.

143
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,980
Sir down.

144
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,500
That's true.

145
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,180
Listen.

146
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,340
Drink some water.

147
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,460
Get lost.

148
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,700
Don't feel too desperate.

149
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,740
All thanks to Professor Sun.

150
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,740
He has translated the words
on the tortoise shell.

151
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,940
Turns out what my grandfather left us...

152
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,900
is half of the Book of Dragon Bones.

153
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,900
Book of Dragon Bones?

154
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,860
This is the legendary Book of Dragon Bones.

155
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,500
This is priceless.

156
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,860
Professor Sun.

157
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,460
You're the expert in this field.

158
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,100
Please explain it.

159
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,620
Everyone is steady now?

160
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,340
I'll make it short.

161
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,060
At the beginning of script,

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,580
there were actually eight tones.

163
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Other than the four usual tones...

164
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,620
that we use nowadays,

165
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,660
there were another four,

166
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,500
which were monopolized by the rulers,

167
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,100
to become a secret language.

168
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,220
The symbols on this tortoise shell...

169
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,220
are in this secret language.

170
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,380
I've studied it my whole life...

171
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,780
to have this humble result.

172
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,420
In this world, I might be the only one...

173
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,300
who can understand this content.

174
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,180
What does the Book of Dragon Bones say?

175
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,220
In fact,

176
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,060
the Book of Dragon Bones...

177
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,260
has an unofficial history.

178
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,580
It's about a Feng Shui master,

179
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,740
Li Chun Feng.

180
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,060
Li Chun Feng was tasked by
the emperor of Tang Dynasty, Li Shi Min,

181
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,260
to find the Dust Bead.

182
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,740
He spent his entire life...

183
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,420
and finally found a record about Dust Bead,

184
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,300
Book of Dragon Bones.

185
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Li Chun Feng studied whole-heartedly.

186
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,540
Finally, he deciphered the secret language,

187
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,860
and found out about Dust Bead.

188
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,700
But Li Chun Feng changed his mind.

189
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,660
He thought if Dust Bead appears again,

190
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,220
it wouldn't be good for the emperor and the folks.

191
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,460
So he split the Book of Dragon Bones into two,

192
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,620
and gave the irrelevant part to Li Shi Min.

193
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,540
The other half was being hidden
in the Tang Palace.

194
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,260
Later Dynasty Tang was destroyed.

195
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,340
This Book of Dragon Bones ended up...

196
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,620
in the hand of Xixia's overlord, Li Yuan Hao.

197
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,540
That's the half in our hands.

198
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,700
He has hidden the other half.

199
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,060
It's said that he brought it into his own grave.

200
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,980
The Book of Dragon Bones...

201
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,380
that grandfather left behind...

202
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,220
only describes the appearance of Dust Bead.

203
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
If the other half is found,

204
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,060
I think we'll know where it is.

205
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,100
The hometown of Li Chun Feng
is in the county of Gulan.

206
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
He would surely be brought back to his hometown.

207
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,340
So his tomb...

208
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,100
should be around here.

209
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,820
That's right.

210
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,140
So Professor Sun...

211
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,940
reported to Bureau of Cultural Relics,

212
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,700
and then we rushed here immediately.

213
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,660
But we didn't expect...

214
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,700
to meet you guys here.

215
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,380
Regarding the rash,

216
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,420
I feel sorry.

217
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,980
I'm prepared...

218
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,780
to find Dust Bead alone.

219
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,460
No matter how long it will take,

220
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,940
I'll surely find it,

221
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,540
for all of your sake.

222
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,660
Ms. Yang.

223
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,460
Regarding the rash,

224
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,860
that wasn't intentional.

225
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,740
So Fatty and I wouldn't mind that.

226
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,900
However,

227
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,620
if you're looking for
the tomb of Li Chun Feng,

228
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,620
we have to go together.

229
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,620
Old Hu.

230
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,700
Old Hu.

231
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,580
She caused us to get the rash.

232
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,540
Why are we going with her?

233
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,780
If anything happens,

234
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,180
let me tell you,

235
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,180
we will not live beyond 50 years old.

236
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,020
Are you alright?

237
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,540
You kept encouraging me to find Dust Bead.

238
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,460
What now?

239
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,460
Changed your mind?

240
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,620
I didn't.

241
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,580
Back then,

242
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,420
we didn't know that...

243
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,020
the American girl was to be blamed.

244
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,140
Since it's clear now,

245
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,220
she should be responsible.

246
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,700
Let her find it.

247
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,980
Why are we risking ourselves?

248
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
He's right.

249
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,380
I've harmed you guys once.

250
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,060
I don't want to get you involved again.

251
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,380
Fatty, let me tell you.

252
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,300
We're on the same boat now.

253
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,620
We can't leave each other.

254
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
If anything happens,

255
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,180
we should figure it out together.

256
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,460
This is the only way to increase the success rate.

257
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,300
Get it?

258
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,180
Get what?

259
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,860
Sooner or later, she'll cause your death.

260
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,260
Excuse me.

261
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,060
Allow me to be demotivating.

262
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,220
Look.

263
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,060
There are some many graveyards in Gulan County.

264
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,340
How should we find Li Chun Feng's tomb?

265
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,660
I reckon,

266
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,940
Li Chun Feng was...

267
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,820
considered as the founder of Mojin Xiaowei.

268
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,340
His tomb...

269
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,300
must have been selected meticulously.

270
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,620
That's right.

271
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,140
Li Chun Feng is...

272
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,420
one of the few...

273
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,460
Feng Shui masters, who died in peace.

274
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,620
That means...

275
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,580
we should find a place...

276
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,580
with best Feng Shui here.

277
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,180
Is that what you mean?

278
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,700
Feng Shui is subjective.

279
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,660
We can't tell which is the best.

280
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,740
On the other hand,

281
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,660
the half of...

282
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,140
The 16 Words Yin & Yang Occult that I have...

283
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,100
mentioned a place called Build-in Well.

284
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,260
As the saying goes,

285
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,620
everything goes back to its origin.

286
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,340
It can collect fortune in Feng Shui's saying.

287
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,340
The odd part of Build-in Well is that...

288
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,260
it's actually a spot with great Feng Shui,

289
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,060
but from its appearance,

290
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,460
it doesn't look like it at all.

291
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,820
Build-in Well?

292
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,340
I have heard about it as well.

293
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,500
It's said that there's a spring there.

294
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,980
It's profound...

295
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,580
and extraordinary.

296
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,100
In short,

297
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,220
we have to find the Build-in Well...

298
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,220
in Gulan County.

299
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,460
It may be Li Chun Feng's tomb.

300
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Isn't there a tomb underneath...

301
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,540
Fish-skeleton Temple?

302
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:22,940
Go further,

303
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,700
Li Chun Feng's tomb should be there.

304
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,420
Fatty.

305
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,340
That tomb in Fish-skeleton Temple
belonged to Xizhou.

306
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,940
Li Chun Feng's tomb belonged to Tang Dynasty.

307
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,300
Are they the same?

308
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,220
Almost.

309
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,340
Almost?

310
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,140
They're very different.

311
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,820
It's just a small mistake.

312
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,020
It's okay.

313
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
If there's no way,

314
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,060
we'll study the topography...

315
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,300
of this area again.

316
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,540
We can just look through...

317
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,140
all the tombs of Tang Dynasty in Gulan County.

318
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,300
Look thoroughly.

319
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,660
That's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

320
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,580
Are you looking down on yourself?

321
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,180
No, Fatty.

322
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,180
Professor Sun from Bureau of Cultural Relics...

323
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,300
is working with us...

324
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,420
to find relics for the country.

325
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,380
Even I, Golden Tooth, is helping...

326
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,580
as a common folk.

327
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,660
What now?

328
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,660
But are you, someone who wants to join the army,

329
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,140
afraid?

330
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm...

331
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
not afraid.

332
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
Professor Sun said,

333
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,540
Dragon Ridge has a special topography.
It collapses easily.

334
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
If we find the tomb of Li Chun Feng...

335
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,300
to carry out scientific research,

336
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,820
it'll be a contribution to national relics.

337
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Have you heard that?

338
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,300
Don't worry, Ms. Yang.

339
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,540
Get some rest.
We'll depart tomorrow morning.

340
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,980
Okay, Old Jin.

341
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,180
Despite of your look,

342
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,060
you're enlightened.

343
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Don't you look down on me.

344
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,860
Goats.

345
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,900
You are luckier than me.

346
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,100
I know when I will die,

347
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,780
yet I don't think properly.

348
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,580
The so-called bead...

349
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,780
is not even there.

350
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,660
Even if it's there,

351
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,300
a capable person like Zhe Gu Shao...

352
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,580
couldn't find it,

353
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,460
how can I find it?

354
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,620
Am I right?

355
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,380
My life is a misery.

356
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,940
I couldn't join the army, although I wanted it.

357
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,540
I can't earn much money as a trader.

358
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,260
Finally, I could...

359
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,500
do something outstanding with Old Hu.

360
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,940
But I faced this...

361
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,780
If I can't go back this time,

362
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,260
I will not be able...

363
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,460
to eat the noodles that my mother makes anymore.

364
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,060
Mother, if I manage to go back,

365
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,780
I will never say your noodles aren't good anymore.

366
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,740
I am not filial enough.

367
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,980
I haven't found you a daughter-in-law
all these years,

368
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,820
to give Wang family any descendant.

369
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:10,980
Who?

370
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,660
I...

371
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,460
When did you come?

372
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,020
Look at yourself.

373
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,100
What did you hear?

374
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,820
Nothing.

375
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,580
I think I heard about...

376
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,740
noodles and daughter-in-law.

377
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,380
What noodles and daughter-in-law?

378
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,740
You miss the American girl,

379
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,580
but don't allow me to miss my girl.

380
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Don't talk nonsense.

381
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,260
Who's missing her?

382
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,100
You may miss whoever you want.

383
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,060
Don't miss the goats here.

384
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,940
Who's missing the goats?

385
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,700
Nonsense.

386
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,380
This is yours. There's one more.

387
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,860
Osmanthus.

388
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
That's precious.

389
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,500
Can this still be smoked?

390
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,260
No, it can't be ignited.

391
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
Just smell it.

392
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,660
Fatty.

393
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,540
Remember when we were kids,

394
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,140
you were always being hit in the garden?

395
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,500
I don't like what you said.

396
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,740
What do you mean by being hit?

397
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,860
If it weren't for you...

398
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,060
who looked silly and was always bullied,

399
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,140
I wouldn't pick fights with others.

400
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,540
Alright.

401
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,380
I still remember,

402
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,300
there was once, my bag was stolen,

403
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,060
you chased that person with a slab.

404
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,540
You ended up being hit...

405
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,060
horribly by his 5 brothers.

406
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,540
You were bleeding in front of my house.

407
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,020
I remember, it was cold that day.

408
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,340
When you returned my bag,

409
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,820
I was really touched.

410
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,700
I really didn't know that...

411
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,300
all his brothers were home.

412
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,500
The youngest one was the best fighter.

413
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,540
That fellow hit me with a slab.

414
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,260
I screamed so loud.

415
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,860
How dare you criticize me?

416
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,260
I was the one being hit,

417
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,620
but you were so scared that
you skipped school for a week.

418
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,100
Look at your coward face.

419
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,540
I didn't skip school because I was scared.

420
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
You don't know that...

421
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,780
I also found a slab.

422
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,300
I really don't know about that.

423
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,060
You went to revenge me?

424
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,700
No.

425
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,460
I slapped myself.

426
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,540
It was so painful.

427
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,620
The swelling...

428
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,820
didn't go away after a week.

429
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,740
As if I had a plum on my head.

430
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,820
How could I go to school?

431
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,700
Are you crazy?

432
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,140
You slapped yourself with a slab?

433
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,740
I just wanted to know...

434
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,140
how painful it was to you.

435
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,780
Fatty.

436
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,460
We survived the Haunted Cave,

437
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,980
there's nothing that can scare us anymore.

438
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,220
If you think I'm your brother,

439
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,300
trust me.

440
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
I'll assure that...

441
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
you can return home to your mother...

442
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,860
safe and sound.

443
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,660
You can marry your girl with noodles.

444
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,060
Okay?

445
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,220
If anything happens to you,

446
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,100
I wouldn't know how to tell your mother.

447
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,980
I know about what you did...

448
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,260
in Beijing.

449
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
You always help that widow and her daughter.

450
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,300
You just want to feel better.

451
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
Can you manage that?

452
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,460
How did you know?

453
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,820
I know everything.

454
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
If that's the case,

455
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,180
you can't die.

456
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
If you're dead,

457
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,460
all your late battle companions...

458
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,340
would come back to life...

459
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,740
to kill me.

460
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,380
Go away.

461
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,340
What I mean is,

462
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,820
it's just a small disease.

463
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,940
When we find the bead,

464
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,420
this will be over.

465
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,220
Right?

466
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,660
Yeah.

467
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,780
It'll be over when we find it.

468
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,580
Old Hu.

469
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,020
Old Hu.

470
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,380
Old Hu.

471
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,700
Hu Ba Yi.

472
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,500
Old Hu.

473
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,060
Hu Ba Yi.

474
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,140
What's going on?

475
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,020
Have you seen Old Hu?

476
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,060
Why is he gone so early?

477
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,620
I haven't.

478
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,260
Did he go out?

479
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,540
Have a look,

480
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,700
if your equipment is missing.

481
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,940
Fatty.

482
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,380
Where's Old Hu?

483
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,540
I didn't see him.

484
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,020
Did he go for exercise?

485
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
Nonsense, he never exercises.

486
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,300
How can an adult go missing?

487
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,380
Rope, shovels and torch lights...

488
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,540
are all gone.

489
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,620
Oh, no.

490
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,300
We haven't talked it through last night.

491
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,460
He's looking for the tomb himself.

492
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,140
No way.

493
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,460
I can't let him die alone.

494
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,820
Calm down. Listen to me.

495
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,340
It's possible that...

496
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,620
he went to the graveyard area outskirt.

497
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,820
You two go find him there.

498
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,620
What about you?

499
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,020
There's another possibility.

500
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
If I were him,

501
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,060
I would first find out...

502
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,660
more about Li Chun Feng's tomb in the city.

503
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,780
Wasn't Ma Da Dan looking for you?

504
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,980
Therefore,

505
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,580
Only I can go to the city.

506
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,580
Ms. Yang.

507
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,820
You're both pretty and smart.

508
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,940
Stop the nonsense. Let's go.

509
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,060
Bring my clothes and equipment.

510
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,860
Okay.

511
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,180
What's going on?

512
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,020
Hu Ba Yi is missing.

513
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,300
We have to find him.

514
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,220
I'll come along.

515
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,340
You should stay here.

516
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,380
The paths are tough.

517
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,820
Stay safe.

518
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,220
You stay here. We're leaving now.

519
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,020
Be careful.

520
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,820
Okay.

521
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,380
Old Hu.

522
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,740
Mr. Hu.

523
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,380
Hu Ba Yi.

524
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,340
Mr. Hu.

525
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,780
Old Hu.

526
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,620
Mr. Jin.

527
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,860
We're near the graveyard area.

528
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,700
Okay.

529
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,780
This is a mountainous area.

530
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,740
Where should we find him?

531
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Let's go that way.

532
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,780
We'll find a way soon.

533
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,020
Old Hu.

534
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,300
Mr. Hu.

535
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,460
This is vast.

536
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,460
Where can Old Hu be?

537
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,140
Fatty,

538
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,100
is that a living creature?

539
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,540
Yes.

540
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,700
He is moving.

541
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,020
Mister.

542
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,460
-Mister.
-Mister.

543
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,780
-Mister.
-Mister.

544
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,540
Mister.

545
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,780
Mister.

546
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,980
-Mister.
-Mister.

547
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,940
Mister.

548
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,940
Mister.

549
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,260
Mister.

550
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,220
Hold on.

551
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,100
Mister.

552
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm not a bad guy. I just want to ask something.

553
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,460
Why are you hiding?

554
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,940
Fatty, calm down.

555
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,860
We finally found a living creature.

556
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,460
Don't scare him away.

557
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,420
Mister.

558
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,180
Don't be afraid.

559
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,940
We just want to ask about someone.

560
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,700
Did you see a man,

561
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,660
who's about my height,

562
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,420
slimmer than him,

563
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
and as good looking...

564
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,980
as the two of us?

565
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,100
Did you see him?

566
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,860
I just came back from underground.

567
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,180
Someone asked me for direction.

568
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,940
I think he's the one you mentioned.

569
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,300
He...

570
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,180
looks better than you two.

571
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,940
-That's him.
-That's him.

572
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,660
Are you sure that person...

573
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,260
is the one we're looking for?

574
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,100
I'm sure.

575
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,860
He has the same accent as you two.

576
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,340
Where did you see him?

577
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,860
Can you tell us the direction, please?

578
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,420
There are many junctions there.

579
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,620
It isn't easy.

580
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,180
Oh, no.

581
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,340
Since I have nothing to do,

582
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,020
why don't I take you there?

583
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,780
I know this area well.

584
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,340
Thank you very much.

585
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Please take us there.

586
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,580
Then follow me.

587
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,020
Okay, after you.

588
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,060
We've met a kind person.

589
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,980
Old man.

590
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,060
I've brought here what you want.

591
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,420
Check it thoroughly...

592
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,700
if I return it to you in whole.

593
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,980
You're right.

594
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Not only that.

595
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,180
Regarding your friend,

596
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,740
we have buried him well.

597
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,940
Thank you very much.

598
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,900
It seems you have understood...

599
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,340
my plan thoroughly.

600
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,300
When we found this Fragrant Jade,

601
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,940
I realized that the scent...

602
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,500
is familiar.

603
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,540
It's the same scent on the copper coin...

604
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,780
when you were telling our fortune.

605
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,820
Besides,

606
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,300
this jade is in the shape of a dragon.

607
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,180
So I'm sure that...

608
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,980
you and...

609
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
the Mojin Xiaowei have...

610
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,060
an unusual relationship.

611
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,860
During the time of war,

612
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,620
dragon-shaped jades were always in pair.

613
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,940
Only the nobles...

614
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,820
would wear them with their closed ones.

615
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,540
If I guess it right,

616
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,980
the other dragon-shaped jade...

617
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,780
must be with you.

618
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,980
Carry on.

619
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,060
It seems...

620
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,180
when you told our fortune,

621
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,500
you already knew that we are Mojin Xiaowei.

622
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,860
So you made use of a tally...

623
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,500
to guide us to Fish-skeleton Temple,

624
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,460
in order to obtain this Fragrant Jade.

625
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,820
After we got the Fragrant Jade,

626
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,980
you have your ways...

627
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,940
to force us to see you.

628
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,740
Because you knew that...

629
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,100
we have this rash on our backs,

630
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,740
which would turn to the shape of an eyeball.

631
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,500
Old man.

632
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,580
To be honest,

633
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,260
you weren't being kind.

634
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,260
You were just making use of us.

635
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,580
That was my last desperate measure.

636
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,860
I didn't expect you to succeed.

637
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,700
But you did come back with the thing.

638
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,300
I'm impressed.

639
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,180
I can't work for nothing.

640
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,340
I have to ask you something.

641
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,300
Go ahead.

642
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,020
Is it about the eyeball rash?

643
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,460
I've already known about the rash.

644
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,780
What I want to know is,

645
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,740
where the tomb of Li Chun Feng is.

646
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,620
I pray for your guidance.

647
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,140
I am just a blind old man.

648
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,300
Tomb raiding is...

649
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,780
not my expertise.

650
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,020
Old man.

651
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,220
Don't fool around with me.

652
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,260
You're a friend to Mojin Xiaowei.

653
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,380
who was underneath Fish-skeleton Temple.

654
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,740
You should know about...

655
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,340
the graveyards in Gulan County.

656
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,580
Please be honest.

657
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,300
How much do you know...

658
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,860
about the tomb of Li Chun Feng?

659
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,300
Well,

660
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,020
I have...

661
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,500
never heard about it.

662
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,300
Look,

663
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,180
you have done me a big favor.

664
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,700
why would I lie to you?

665
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,060
However,

666
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,980
I really can't help you.

667
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,260
Hu Ba Yi.

668
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,700
How can you believe in fortune-telling?

669
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,300
Why are you here?

670
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,180
I was looking for you in the city.

671
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Come back with me.

672
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380
Everyone's waiting for you.

673
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,180
Who's this lady?

674
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,620
Don't hurry back.

675
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Let me introduce...

676
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,220
