[Episode 18]

3
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,320
Old Hu,

4
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,800
he's going to die.

5
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,680
I think...

6
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,439
he's gone crazy.

7
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,040
Why did he run away?

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,760
Stay with us, we can look after each other.

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,719
And now...

10
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,359
he's going to get himself killed.

11
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,360
Mr. Hu,

12
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,400
why did the spider

13
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,439
attack Li Chun Lai only, not us?

14
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,599
Probably because of the Book of Dragon Bones.

15
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,039
It has a weird smell on it.

16
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,120
Some secret powder was applied to it.

17
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,159
A spider is short-sighted...

18
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,439
and has no ear.

19
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,439
Its nerve detected this smell...

20
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,599
and made it anticipate the incoming danger.

21
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,640
That's why it dared not go forward.

22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
Then, how did Li Chun Lai die?

23
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,279
This box killed him.

24
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
It must be made...

25
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,759
to isolate the smell of Book of Dragon Bones.

26
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,559
If Li Chun Lai wasn't greedy...

27
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,599
and took only the book without the box,

28
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,839
the spider wouldn't have attacked him.

29
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,439
He's simply a greedy man.

30
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,520
It's all fate.

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Mr. Hu, Ms. Yang,

32
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,240
do you think this trap...

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,559
was designed to choose the eligible person...

34
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,719
to get the book out of here?

35
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
If the Dust Bead was harmful,

36
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,999
the Founder wouldn't make its whereabouts...

37
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,360
an eternal secret.

38
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:08,879
I think...

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,920
we should stop pondering...

40
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,399
what Founder's mind was.

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Let's think of a way to get out of here.

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
We're still trapped in here.

43
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:16,840
That's right.

44
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,199
Although the spider didn't attack us,

45
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,840
there are bats.

46
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,879
We might get away with bats,

47
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,280
but the exit is still nowhere to be seen.

48
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,759
I think...

49
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,559
they're trying to keep us here.

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,079
There's a sound.

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,439
What a living bodhisattva.

52
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,519
Mr. Goose, you're lingering around here.

53
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,079
Follow it.

54
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,399
Animals are sensitive to air flow.

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
It might lead us to the exit.

56
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,879
Sure.

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
Mr. Goose, if you manage to get me out of here,

58
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,879
I would stop eating goose for the rest of my life.

59
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,160
You're my ancestor.

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,999
Living ancestor.

61
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,600
-Don't move.
-Freeze. Stay still.

62
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,920
-Be good.
-Be good.

63
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,759
Who's that?

64
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,360
Comrade Hu Ba Yi,

65
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,759
you can even find me here.

66
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,639
Thanks to Old Man Chen.

67
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,040
If it hadn't been for him,

68
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,519
we wouldn't have come here.

69
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,160
Old Man Chen...

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,439
has told me about your situation.

71
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,280
Cultural Heritage Administration
and the archaeology team...

72
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,999
will deal with follow-ups.

73
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,040
Thank you.

74
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,680
Don't mention it.

75
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,759
We're responsible to assist you.

76
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,840
-Go.
-Get up.

77
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,319
I failed because of you. I admit it.

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,759
Take him away.

79
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,480
Move.

80
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,280
Come on. Sit down.

81
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
Anyway,

82
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,439
who's in the coffin?

83
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,559
We never know that.

84
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,319
What's the point of this trip?

85
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,559
We're here to look for the Book of Dragon Bones.

86
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,800
It doesn't matter who that was.

87
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
It's a worthwhile trip

88
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,079
because he guided us to the book.

89
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,680
We should thank him.

90
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,439
Mr. Hu,

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
let's leave this place now.

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,759
Let's go.

93
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,199
Old Man,

94
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
thanks for your help.

95
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,360
It's about fate.

96
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,559
Young Man,

97
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,840
I always think that...

98
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,720
you're...

99
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,160
like me.

100
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
Thank you, Old Man.

101
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,559
You've made it clear with the police.

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
I can't...

103
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,720
take your money for nothing.

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Let's go now.

105
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,879
We need Professor Sun...

106
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,120
to tell us about the mystery
of this tortoise shell.

107
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,360
Let's go.

108
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,799
In modern Chinese character,

109
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,360
this word is called Dian.

110
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,960
It's the abbreviation for Yunnan.

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,799
And this word...

112
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,200
is Xian,

113
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,960
as in contribution.

114
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
But look,

115
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,999
these two characters...

116
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,919
are located on different parts of the shell.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,240
It's hard to find out their relationship.

118
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,399
I need to look into it.

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,999
What you said is pointless.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,039
We can't turn Yunnan upside down again...

121
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,879
just because of the word Dian.

122
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,960
Old Hu, the noodles are getting gooey.

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,600
Why don't I...

124
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:05,679
Professor Sun,

125
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:06,999
since...

126
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,440
we've identified the meanings of Dian and Xian.

127
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,679
So the meaning of these two words,

128
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,960
you should have known them too.

129
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,159
The word Dian,

130
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
technically speaking,

131
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,799
refers to the Dian Kingdom.

132
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,279
The Dian Kingdom...

133
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,480
was located nearby the Dian Lake, wasn't it?

134
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,720
Dust Bead...

135
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,639
was a meaningful thing for the emperors.

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,600
It symbolized their power and prosperity.

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,279
So, before finding the bead,

138
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,919
you must know its historical value...

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,560
so as to speculate...

140
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,679
its possible whereabouts.

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Then, tell me

142
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,679
where the bead is.

143
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,879
You're making me anxious.

144
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,879
Young Man,

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,999
you seem to be interested in Dian Kingdom.

146
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
Then, tell me about it.

147
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,720
Well,

148
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,480
I'm going to say something...

149
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,320
about it, Professor Sun.

150
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,039
OK.

151
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,960
Dian Kingdom

152
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,919
is full of mysteries indeed.

153
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,159
Historians call it The Lost Kingdom.

154
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,200
It's formed during the Shang dynasty...

155
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,919
and ruined probably during
the Western Han dynasty.

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,120
Am I right?

157
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,879
It's said that the Kingdom

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,879
had a very serious civil war.

159
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,519
Some of its people left the kingdom

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,480
for the mountains

161
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,720
where they lived as the recluses.

162
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,039
Since then,

163
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,919
these people were slowly forgotten

164
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,159
by the world.

165
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,159
People can only know about them

166
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,120
by reading a book called Book of...

167
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:45,919
Tuo...

168
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,279
Book of Tuo Hu?

169
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,879
Because of the ancient book.

170
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,879
Am I right, Professor Sun?

171
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,919
That's right.

172
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,999
Never judge a book by its cover.

173
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,360
Say something about their leader.

174
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,480
I'm ignorant about that.

175
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,200
Professor Sun, please give us some clue.

176
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,320
During the late Shang dynasty,

177
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,440
some people in the Dian Kingdom...

178
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,679
practiced witchcraft and black magic.

179
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,919
In order to escape from the war,

180
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
these people

181
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,560
left the kingdom,

182
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,360
and moved to the mountains by Lancang River.

183
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,200
Their leader...

184
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,320
called himself King Xian.

185
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,560
Then, the word Xian refers to King Xian.

186
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,919
That means we need to find the tomb of King Xian.

187
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,639
The tomb of King Xian is just a legend.

188
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,639
There are many mountain leaders

189
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,560
like him

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
throughout the history of China.

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,039
There's not much historical evidence...

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,960
of King Xian.

193
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,759
It's impossible to find his tomb.

194
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,200
Professor Sun, if you don't explain it well,

195
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,840
we'll go to Yunnan now.

196
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,960
We'll find it,

197
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,600
even if that means using Tomb Calming Skill.

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Tomb Calming Skill is only useful,

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,879
when it comes to flatland.

200
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,679
Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is
geographically complex.

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
It's full of rivers,

202
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,080
and the weather is unpredictable.

203
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
In order to find the tomb,

204
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,600
you need to have a concrete clue.

205
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,120
If not, you can't locate it.

206
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,799
Can't we do anything about it?

207
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,440
I know how you feel.

208
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,679
But for now,

209
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,879
I can only identify these two words.

210
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
So, I'm not sure about

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,879
the whole situation yet.

212
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,240
Give me some time.

213
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,799
Let me find and study

214
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,159
other ancient texts first...

215
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,519
Finding and studying other ancient texts.

216
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,360
So you can be a free rider
for a few more years, can't you?

217
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,879
What a good time to be a professor.

218
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,440
You get to entertain yourself

219
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
and travel for free.

220
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,679
You've had a free trip to Shaanxi.

221
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,519
And now...

222
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,639
you want to have one to Yunnan.

223
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,440
I don't know you.

224
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,200
Why do you keep criticizing me?

225
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,840
Because I'm a just person.

226
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,960
I forgive you for your ignorance.

227
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,240
And you should stop
pretending to be an intellect,

228
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,560
misleading youngsters.

229
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,039
You're a liar,

230
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,919
and a free rider.

231
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,480
Palaeography is a wide and profound field.

232
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,639
I can't simply make conclusions.

233
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm not trying to brag here.

234
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,200
But I am...

235
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
the most leading palaeographer...

236
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,080
in this world.

237
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,240
Of course, you are.

238
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,960
It's because...

239
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,120
you're the oldest among all.

240
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,080
And some of them were capable but had died

241
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,799
Then, how old are you?

242
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,960
I think...

243
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,960
both of you are seniors.

244
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm not as old as him.

245
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,600
What childish old men.

246
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
Who are you talking about?

247
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,080
What an old man.

248
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,639
Ms. Yang told me that...

249
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,999
you're...

250
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,799
the leader of Moving Mountain Sect.

251
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
That means...

252
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,120
you were an old bandit digging tombs and graves?

253
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,960
Now I get it.

254
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,560
You're criticizing my profession,

255
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,039
because you can't argue with me.

256
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,320
Is that what a professor does?

257
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,960
In that case,

258
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,840
you're no different than a bandit.

259
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,999
You said I pretended to be smart.

260
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,919
Then, tell me where the tomb of King Xian is?

261
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,679
That tomb does exist.

262
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,279
But some materialistic bookworm

263
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,440
doesn't know about it.

264
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,159
My child,

265
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,560
don't always believe

266
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,799
anyone.

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,039
Titles aren't reliable.

268
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,480
Seeing is believing.

269
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,159
Just stop bluffing.

270
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,440
You're a blind man.

271
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,919
What's wrong with being blind?

272
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,639
If I manage to show you the item,

273
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,279
will you admit that you're not smart

274
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
and misleading youngsters?

275
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,679
Take a look at it.

276
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
Just Look at it. Don't touch.

277
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,039
Get your hand off me.

278
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,919
This is the map of King Xian's tomb.

279
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,080
Believe it or not,

280
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,679
I found it...

281
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,560
at King Xian tomb located...

282
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,159
in the Lijia Mountain of Yunnan.

283
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,200
I see.

284
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
You're making it up.

285
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,320
You said the map was found in King Xian's tomb.

286
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,759
Does that mean...

287
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,720
King Xian was your peer,

288
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,200
a grave robber too?

289
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,200
Lack of critical thinking
gives birth to ignorance.

290
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,200
It's useless for one to be educated.

291
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,639
Here,

292
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,720
let me teach you.

293
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,440
Those two kingdoms were a family.

294
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,799
But King Xian formed another kingdom.

295
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,679
After that,

296
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,320
he chose a tomb spot...

297
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:03,199
with good Feng Shui.
A place free from grave robbers.

298
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
But...

299
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,159
his kingdom was ruined not long after.

300
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,080
After he died,

301
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:14,719
his followers wanted to go back
to their motherland.

302
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,560
They then drew King Dian...

303
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,879
the map of King Xian's tomb...

304
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,919
and said that...

305
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,360
they'd get King Dian a tomb spot as good as that.

306
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,679
If you don't believe it,

307
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,639
turn this human skin over...

308
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,919
and read what's written behind it.

309
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,360
Don't believe him.

310
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:40,280
A lying fortune teller

311
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,080
always gets his props ready.

312
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,040
Here's a question.

313
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,080
You said you had been to the tomb.

314
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,560
But you have no evidence.

315
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,639
Moving Mountain Sect

316
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,719
always bluffs because you had many members.

317
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,040
Evidence?

318
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,320
What evidence do you want?

319
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
This pair of eyes

320
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,120
is the evidence.

321
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,600
That year,

322
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,639
I led my brothers...

323
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
to King Dian's tomb to seize this map.

324
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:47,000
After coming out of it,

325
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:50,399
I saw the white mist coming out of everywhere.

326
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,360
Having learned qinggong when I was young,

327
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,479
I held my breath and got out of there.

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,320
But my eyes

329
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,439
was ruined by the poisonous mist.

330
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,080
Luckily, a Bai brother

331
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,919
unhesitatingly

332
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,399
got rid of

333
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,800
my

334
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,679
eye balls.

335
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,679
If not, the poisonous mist would have
got into my pulse.

336
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,040
That's how I survived it.

337
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,280
Evidence.

338
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,840
What other evidence do you want?

339
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
Keep talking.

340
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,199
I need to look up some information.

341
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,360
My child,

342
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,159
King Xian's tomb.

343
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:01,320
is much more dangerous than King Dian's.

344
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,080
According to this map,

345
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,360
between the Worm Valley,

346
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,679
there's a red poisonous gas...

347
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,439
that never goes away.

348
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,800
One dies from coming in contact with it.
If one manages to get into it,

349
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
surely it's more powerful than...

350
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,719
that white mist.

351
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,479
If you're going there,

352
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,120
please be careful.

353
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,120
Sure.

354
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,600
But this map...

355
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:29,760
Old Man,

356
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,679
this map is your hard work.

357
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,399
We can't simply have it.

358
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,879
I'm an old dying blind man.

359
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,239
What's the use to keep this?

360
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:46,679
Moreover, this child is
Zhe Gu Shao's grandchildren.

361
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,199
I should...

362
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,199
teach you all of my skills.

363
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:56,360
But I have a request.

364
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,159
Please say it.

365
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,840
No matter how many requests you have,

366
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,840
we'll fulfill them all.

367
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm just an old man.

368
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,360
I won't ask much...

369
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,840
from a young lady like you.

370
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,840
I just want you to take me
to Zhe Gu Shao's tomb,

371
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:14,800
after getting rid of the rash curse.

372
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,520
That's

373
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,199
my only wish.

374
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,760
No problem.

375
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,639
By then, I will take you to the USA to settle down.

376
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,360
I'll take care of you for the rest of your life.

377
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:29,479
My child,

378
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,000
thanks for your kindness.

379
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:36,280
But I enjoy

380
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,959
being a fortune teller.

381
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,959
I'm old, but I can get to lead

382
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,600
a carefree life.

383
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,479
Isn't that exciting?

384
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:47,399
Old Man,

385
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,919
thank you for your help with this journey.

386
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,520
It's my honor

387
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,840
to meet a legendary man like you.

388
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,439
I'm not legendary.

389
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,639
Thinking back to the past,

390
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,520
I realize that...

391
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
I was looking for trouble.

392
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,120
It's...

393
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,879
all in the past.

394
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,520
Let the past...

395
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,600
be a book full of memories.

396
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,120
Young Man,

397
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:33,800

a bowl of wontons.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,800
One more.

402
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,959
Sure.

403
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,399
Why are you here?

404
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,879
What? Only you can eat wonton?

405
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,760
What is this?

406
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,800
Your reward.

407
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:26,959
I don't want it.

408
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,360
You don't want it.

409
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,399
What about them?

410
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,040
You have given your money to your comrades.

411
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,399
Just accept it.

412
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:40,919
It's my small token.

413
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,879

Here are your wontons.

416

Boss,

417
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,199
we ordered two bowls of wontons only.

418
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,239
We didn't order these.

419
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,479
Commander Hu.

420
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:06,800
Commander Hu.

421
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,560
I've long recognized you.

422
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm little cultured,

423
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,800
but I'm not an idiot.

424
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,520
I know,

425
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,879
all these years,

426
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,280
you've been looking after me and my child.

427
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,320
I have nothing valuable to repay you.

428
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,879
I got you this sausage from my hometown.

429
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,120
Have a taste.

430

Big Sister,

431
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,360
don't mention it.

432
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,439
It's my responsibility.

433
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,320
I...

434
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,760
I should have saved Big Liu.

435
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,840
Commander Hu, it's not your fault.

436
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,879
Moreover,

437
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,320
it's all in the past.

438
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Let's not talk about it.

439
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:49,439
Try it now...

440
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,120
before it gets cold.

441
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,760

keep the money.

443
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,560

I can't accept it.

446

Since you're here,

00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,399
I need to tell you that...

are you the commander
that my father talked about in his letter?

457
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,239
My father said you're a good man.

458
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,000
Uncle, eat this.

459
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,399
It's my father's favorite wonton.

460
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,239
Why were you there

461
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
all of a sudden?

462
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:24,600
I wanted to have wontons peacefully.

463
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:25,959
Your appearance...

464
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,679
almost gave me a heart attack.

465
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,320
Wasn't it amazing?

466
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,760
Something more amazing behind.

467
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,879
Yes, it is.

468
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,399
This girl is really something.

469
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,479
Do you think she came back

470
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,879
all the way from the USA

471
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,439
for the Dust Bead?

472
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,199
So is Hu Ba Yi.

473
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,239
He's pretending to be ignorant.

474
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,479
Just look at him.

475
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,560
You Beijinese

476
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,760
always act ignorant.

477
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,040
What am I talking about?

478
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,399
Now you even know how to use the word Chuai.

479
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,120
Please translate this.

480
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,679

00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,280
Cash.

482
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,479
Cash.

483
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,320
Why does that sound familiar?

484
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Who are you lying to?

485
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,919
It's a word used in
black market for foreign exchange.

486
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,959
That's cash.

487
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,159
Do you think I was Fatty,

488
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
who merely knows money?

489
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,159
Look at

490
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,719
how funny they are.

491
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,760
They can't stop bickering.

492
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,360
Why are you being busybodies?

493
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,719
Why are you criticizing Fatty?

494
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:19,679
You're right.

495
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,000
Fatty...

496
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,320
always gets dragged into troubles.

497
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,320
Hu Ba Yi is talking about

498
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,199
him

499
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,080
just to take him as a shield.

500
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,040
And she does know about that.

501
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,719
And the serious matter

502
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,520
is yet to come.

503
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,639
You foreigners...

504
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:35,280
won't get it.

505
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,479
Then, say something I can understand.

506
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,000
I want to listen, too.

507
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,719
Sure.

508
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,560
Mojin Xiaowei

509
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,080
sounds great, doesn't it?

510
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,719
People always...

511
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,800
see us as thieves.

512
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,040
It's meaningless, so I quit.

513
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,239
You're right.

514
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
What are you saying?

515
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
My grandfather wasn't a thief.

516
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,959
I'm not talking about him,

517
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,520
but myself.

518
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,520
I'm talking about Blind Chen.

519
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,239
Okay?

520
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,000
So, are we going to Yunnan?

521
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,280
Of course.

522
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,840
We're all in this together.

523
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,639
I have to think about it.

524
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,959
You haven't told me...

525
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,679
what's Chuai in English yet.

526
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,280
You haven't got it over.

527
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,320
You know that phrase too?

528
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,120
And I know the meaning of honey calling.

529
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,360
Tell me what honey is.

530
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:29,679
I am the honey.

531
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,320
The story goes on.

532
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,959
Upon returning to Beijing,

533
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,399
they started preparing for their Yunnan trip.

534
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
Look at this girl.

535
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,120
She's deeply interested in
studying historical documents.

536
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,120
Together with Hu Ba Yi,

537
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,040
they make a powerful team.

538
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,000
And look at this man.

539
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,959
With a magnifying glass in his hand,

540
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,439
he seems to be working hard.

541
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,399
In fact, he knows nothing at all.

542
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,639
Only two of them...

543
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,360
are working.

544
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
And this man is something.

545
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,199
He's sleeping so soundly.

546
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,159
No matter what,

547
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:18,560
Mojins as a team,
united they stand, divided they fall.

548
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,479
From now on,

549
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,520
the three of them is working as a team.

550
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,919
As the saying goes, The Three Mojins...

551
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,439
are in the same boat,

552
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,280
they just came out of The Lost Caverns,

553
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,280
and now they're going to the Worm Valley.

554
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:34,399
The Mojin Trio

555
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,959
is officially formed.

556
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,639
Make room for me,

557
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,959
let's talk about it.

558
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:58,959
Look.

559
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,800
Snake River, a branch of Lancang River.

560
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,320
It's called that due to its snaky shape.

561
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,320
Snake River passes by this mountain.

562
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,840
It's more than 3,300 meters.

563
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,120
The locals call it Mount Veiled Dragon.

564
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,840
Shirley Yang, how's it going there?

565
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,639
It's said that

566
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
it's not windy in Mount Veiled Dragon.

567
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
So, it's hard to

568
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,600
get rid of the poisonous mist.

569
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,320
I've contacted someone in the USA

570
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,840
and purchased a bunch of military gas masks.

571
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:46,000
But I can't guarantee those masks

572
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,800
can work on this special poisonous gas.

573
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,360
Even if they work, that's still pointless.

574
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,879
That place is full of mosquitoes and bugs.

575
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,959
There are full of worms in the mountains.

576
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,679
And they're huge.

577
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,600
I've looked up its local customs.

578
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,120
It's said that the locals know

579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,280
sorcery.

580
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,879
They poison anyone they dislike...

581
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,280
using bugs.

582
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,679
It's very dark.

583
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,040
It's a remote area.

584
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,800
Their sinofication level isn't that high.

585
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,800
So, we need to be more careful...

586
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,840
to avoid having conflicts with the locals.

587
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,040
Mr. Jin, how's it going?

588
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,199
It's going as planned.

589
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,600
Entrenching tools, climbing ropes,
and flashlights.

590
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:27,840
I've got everything ready for you.

591
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,719
I've got you several types of insecticides.

592
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:30,879
Just use them as you like.

593
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,360
What about guns?

594
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:33,280
Gun?

595
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,280
What gun?

596
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,760
Like five-bullet gun or handgun.

597
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,120
Handgun?

598
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,439
I can't even get you a spear
with red horse-hair tassel.

599
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,800
It's illegal.

600
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:43,719
We can't do that.

601
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,239
Mr. Jin, am I going to use an entrenching tool

602
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,280
to fight?

603
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,320
If we were to bump into...

604
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,760
an animal as big as that spider,

605
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,399
who would win the fight?

606
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,080
I can't do anything about it.

607
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,760
It's said that...

608
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,360
The king was killed...

609
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,360
and buried in the Water Dragon Ring.

610
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
His body decomposed and became an
immortalist. The dragon ring is shapeless.

611
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,159
Without a fallen sky,

612
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,080
no one can get into it.

613
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,000
What does this mean?

614
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,120
It means...

615
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,360
King Xian's tomb

616
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,360
is located in the Water Dragon Ring.

617
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,840
In order to get into it,

618
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,639
there must be a fallen sky.

619
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,120
A fallen sky?

620
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,360
Stones falling from the sky.

621
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,280
Isn't that meteor shower?

622
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,159
A meteor shower. That's a nice way to put it.

623
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,280
No, think about it.

624
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,239
If stones were to fall from the sky,

625
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,679
King Xian's tomb would be smashed open.

626
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:36,760
Where could we hide by then?
