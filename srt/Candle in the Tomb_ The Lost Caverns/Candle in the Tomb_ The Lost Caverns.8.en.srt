[Episode 8]

3
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,380
Go to sleep.

4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,060
Guys,

5
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,660
I once went to Black Water City.

6
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:14,420
There were lots of treasures.

7
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,180
How to find it?

8
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,460
How can we find those valuable things?

9
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,700
Go to sleep.

10
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,980
Baby.

11
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,060
There are ghosts in the boat.

12
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,260
Those Chinese said

13
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,740
there was a monster.

14
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,940
Where do you think they're from, master?

15
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,620
I reckon they are Russians.

16
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,620
I heard them mentioning Black Water City.

17
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
Black Water City?

18
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,500
Why are they going to Black Water City?

19
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,060
This group of big-nosed Russians...

20
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,940
robbed tombs in Black Water City.

21
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,940
They destroyed seven pagodas...

22
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,940
and stole many precious relics.

23
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,700
They're lawless.

24
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
There are many taboos...

25
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,140
when sailing on the Yellow River.

26
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,220
We can never say words like...

27
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,220
turn, flip...

28
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,300
or something like that.

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,220
When this isn't obeyed, bad things will happen.

30
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,140
That's right.

31
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,860
A few years ago,

32
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,700
a spice trader...

33
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,420
was sailing at the Yellow Bay.

34
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,580
An old man,

35
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,300
who was wearing a green hat,

36
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,820
They said the same thing
when the seven pagodas were destroyed.

37
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,820
Do you believe them?

38
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,420
Halfway through sailing,

39
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,140
a gigantic green-headed turtle...

40
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,700
turned the boat over.

41
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,820
The spice trader survived.

42
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,860
But all the precious spices sank...

43
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,460
as a tribute to the River God.

44
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,860
Forget those words.

45
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Don't speak any taboos.

46
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,580
Yeah. That's right.

47
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,020
If the boat turns over,

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,300
we would die.

49
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Stop crying.

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
No crying. No crying.

51
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,580
What a poor kid.

52
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,580
Don't cry, Baby.

53
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,420
Here. Here.

54
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,460
Be a good boy.

55
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,420
Hello, madam.

56
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,420
Can I talk to him?

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,860
Kids like me.

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,900
Really? Sure.

59
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,020
Good baby.

60
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,700
Don't cry, baby.

61
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,140
Does his throat hurt?

62
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,420
He caught a cold.

63
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,140
What about this?

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,620
I have some candies.

65
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,900
I come from another country.

66
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,020
Thank you.

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,700
I'll give you some candy, okay?

68
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,900
Okay?

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,140
Have some candy.

70
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,420
Is it good?

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,420
Good.

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Good boy.

73
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,900
Is it good?

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,860
Have some candy.

75
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,300
No more eating.

76
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
Sorry.

77
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,820
I'll leave this to you.

78
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,900
Thank you.

79
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,420
Don't cry. Good boy.

80
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,180
What a busybody.

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Don't cry.

82
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,700
Don't cry. Be good.

83
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,180
Listen to mum.

84
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,300
It's indeed mysterious.

85
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,420
It's so annoying.

86
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,580
Stop crying.

87
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,420
Can you stop it?

88
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,860
Crying.

89
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,140
Crying.

90
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,580
Or else I'll feed you to the fish in the river.

91
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,740
I've sailed this way for hundreds of times,

92
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
but I haven't seen such huge swirls.

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,740
It was calm just now.

94
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,500
How did this happen suddenly?

95
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,060
It must be her. It must be her.

96
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,500
She spoken about the taboos

97
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,940
which angered the River God.

98
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,740
Who?

99
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,740
Which rotter is speaking nonsense on my boat?

100
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Show yourself.

101
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,380
It's her.

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,380
You're talking nonsense. What did I say?

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,940
He was crying nonstop just now.

104
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,140
You said you would feed him
to the fish in the river.

105
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,740
Everyone heard that.

106
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,060
Nonsense.

107
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,180
How could you say that?

108
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,740
I heard it too.

109
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,380
How could you say things like that?

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,060
If God of Dragon hears it,

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,060
he will surely...

112
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,380
be expecting the child now.

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,860
Yeah.

114
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,180
I heard it from the old captain.

115
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,260
If there's a swirl,

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
that means River God wants to eat a child.

117
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,380
How could you say such that?

118
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,420
Throw the child into the river.

119
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,620
Or I will kill you.

120
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
What are you doing?

121
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,380
That kid,

122
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,060
throw him into the river,

123
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,380
so we can survive.

124
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,260
Don't do that, Andrew.

125
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,940
We are all equal in the eyes of God.

126
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,620
Let go.

127
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,740
Let go.

128
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,940
No.

129
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,180
No.

130
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,140
No.

131
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,380
Throw him into the river.

132
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,060
Don't throw my kid.

133
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,740
No.

134
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,740
No.

135
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,180
Guys, kill him.

136
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,860
Are you going to jump...

137
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,940
or should I give you a hand?

138
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,140
I'm going to kill you.

139
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,940
Kill you.

140
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,500
I won't spare you.

141
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,180
Don't be panic.

142
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,500
There's no such a thing as God of Dragon.

143
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,380
It's just a submerged reef.

144
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
Just hold on.

145
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,500
Stop the boat on the north coast.

146
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,740
Stop on the north coast.

147
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,940
That's great.

148
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,740
That's great.

149
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,620
Wake up.

150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,620
Wake up.

151
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,260
Wake up.

152
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,820
It's time to wake up.

153
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Come on. Wake up.

154
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,820
Come on. Wake up.

155
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,740
OK.

156
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,740
Hi.

157
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,500
Hi.

158
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,500
Hi. Look.

159
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,380
Madam, your child.

160
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,620
My child.

161
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
My child.

162
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,740
My child.

163
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,740
Thank you, kind misters.

164
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,060
Please stand up.

165
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,500
Thank you. Thank you.

166
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,380
Thank you.

167
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
May I know...

168
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,620
your name, please?

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,100
We aren't convenient to reveal our identity.

170
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,260
Thank you.

171
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,260
Thank you.

172
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Thank you.

173
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,740
Have mercy, Mr. Gunner.

174
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,500
Have mercy, Mr. Gunner.

175
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,860
Why are you following us?

176
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,140
Because...

177
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,740
Because of you.

178
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,140
Me?

179
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,380
Yeah.

180
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,740
You.

181
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,380
You see yourself on the boat there. You're amazing.

182
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,380
I've never seen anything like that in my life.

183
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,260
Yes.

184
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,380
Because of you.

185
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,740
Do you know you're amazing?

186
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,220
I have been in China for so long,

187
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,140
but I haven't seen...

188
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,740
such powerful Chinese Kung Fu.

189
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
And your shooting skill.

190
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
Aren't you here to revenge your friends?

191
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,900
Those Russians...

192
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,380
weren't my friends.

193
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,380
They heard that I had been to Black Water City,

194
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,260
so they forced me to take them there.

195
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,620
You've been to Black Water City?

196
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Yes. Because I'm a pediatrician.

197
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,900
So I always go there...

198
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,900
to treat the children.

199
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:57,980
And then,

200
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
one day I was lost.

201
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,620
Suddenly I was at Black Water City.

202
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,020
I can never forget that place.

203
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,780
You...

204
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,860
You are going to Black Water City too?

205
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,380
I can guide you.

206
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,340
I know the way. I really do.

207
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,900
I'll guide you there.

208
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,540
Mr. Gunner.

209
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,620
May I know...

210
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,660
how long have you been practicing Kung Fu?

211
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,620
I would like to learn Kung Fu like yours.

212
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Do you think how long I will need?

213
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,140
May I know...

214
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
if Mr. Gunner

215
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,540
has a wife?

216
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,020
Does she know Kung Fu too?

217
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,860
Do you have kids?

218
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,020
Do they know Kung Fu too?

219
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,980
Thomas,

220
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,780
we've been looking the way as you said for two days.

221
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,540
Where's Black Water City?

222
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,780
You should go back to be a doctor.

223
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,780
That's not right.

224
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,260
This was the way I took.

225
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,020
How could it be wrong?

226
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,380
You're not wrong.

227
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,020
Let me do it.

228
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,140
It's said that Black Water City
is outside of Helan Mountain.

229
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,380
It's situated in a precious area.

230
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
It's a piece of land...

231
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,860
with strategic geography.

232
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,740
That mountain range looks like it.

233
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,380
Black Water City should be there,
right after the mountain range.

234
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,780
I recall now.

235
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,020
You're right.

236
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,660
Black Water City is there.

237
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,660
You're awesome, master.

238
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,860
You're truly a Mojin Xiaowei.

239
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,140
It's unexpected...

240
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,380
the once famous city in Xixia...

241
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,260
has ended up like this.

242
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,380
Master.

243
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
According to Feng Shui,

244
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,860
where would Big Sleeping Buddha Temple be?

245
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
Southwest.

246
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,140
Master.

247
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,500
Where's the entrance?

248
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,140
Wait.

249
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,020
Wait?

250
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,020
The entrance of the temple...

251
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
is right in front.

252
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,340
Great.

253
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,380
Hold on.

254
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,500
A single-eyed dragon is buried here.

255
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,780
Single-eyed dragon?

256
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,980
Single-eyed dragon?

257
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Under this ground,

258
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,460
there's a sneaking dragon.

259
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,500
But its size is extraordinarily small.

260
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,260
Besides, there's only one point
at the dragon's head...

261
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,900
that can collect the fortune.

262
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,580
So it's called the single-eyed dragon.

263
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,180
The terrain of this area...

264
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,740
is destroyed by the course changing
of Black Water River.

265
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,020
The precious point at the dragon's head...

266
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,780
has become malignant.

267
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,300
If a person was buried there,

268
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,180
there would be big trouble.

269
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,700
What you mean is,

270
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,660
if someone was buried there,

271
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,940
we'll not be able to enter?

272
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,980
Yes.

273
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,740
It's said that there's an empty grave...

274
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
below this temple.

275
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,740
Since it's an empty grave without a owner,

276
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,020
I think...

277
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,300
we shouldn't take it too seriously.

278
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,700
I have been looking for Dust Bead my whole life.

279
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,460
The hope is right there now.

280
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,740
If we back out now,

281
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,300
I'll not be able to face my ancestors.

282
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,220
I hope you will...

283
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,020
complete my goal.

284
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,020
I took you as my apprentice,

285
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,020
and taught you the virtues.

286
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,740
Right now,

287
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,060
I'm being a coward,

288
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,020
I feel shamed as your master.

289
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,700
Alright then.

290
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,020
Today, if there's joy,

291
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,020
we'll share it,

292
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,180
if there's a difficulty,

293
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,740
we'll bear it together.

294
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,260
As your master,

295
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,020
I'll sacrifice my life to help you.

296
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,740
Thank you, master.

297
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,260
Can we go now then?

298
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,740
None of your business.

299
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,740
You should leave now,

300
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,780
so you wouldn't get hurt.

301
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,260
But...

302
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm already here.

303
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,060
Take me along.

304
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,700
Please.

305
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,500
Mr. Thomas.

306
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,700
There are traps everywhere.

307
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,260
It's very dangerous.

308
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Mr. Gunner.

309
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,260
Your Kung Fu is amazing.

310
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
You can protect me,

311
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,780
right?

312
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,940
Right?

313
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,500
This belongs to my junior, Iron Grinder.

314
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,500
Take it.

315
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,740
Safety first,

316
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,260
no matter the grave has a owner or not.

317
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,460
The civilization of Xixia
existed a thousand year ago.

318
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,300
However, this Eternal Fire is still on.

319
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,260
Dragon Oil is used for the lamps here.

320
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,300
It's said that this lamp oil is very long-lasting.

321
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
But it's hard to find.

322
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,020
Master, look.

323
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,020
That looks like...

324
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,500
Eyes.

325
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,580
Why are you here?

326
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,740
What's wrong?

327
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,460
Did I scare you?

328
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,020
Of course not.

329
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,500
Mr. Thomas.

330
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,900
It's dangerous here.

331
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,260
We didn't allow you here for your own good.

332
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,740
Master, I'm already here.

333
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,580
If I don't come and have a look,

334
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,260
I'll regret forever.

335
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
I beg you.

336
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,980
I can protect myself.

337
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,260
If anything happens,

338
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,340
I'll take responsibility.

339
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,220
I beg you.

340
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Mr. Thomas.

341
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,740
Don't touch anything down there,

342
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,020
in case you may activate the traps.

343
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,180
Don't worry.

344
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,020
I will not touch anything.

345
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,020
I will deal with you when we get out.

346
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,980
What did I eat?

347
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,820
Chinese secret medicine.

348
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,300
It prevents people...

349
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,500
from fainting in a place with...

350
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,820
bad ventilation.

351
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,260
There's a saying in China,

352
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,740
hard on the mouth, soft in the heart.

353
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,020
Mr. Gunner.

354
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,500
Does it fit you?

355
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,020
This corridor may be abnormal.

356
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,700
After this corridor,

357
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,260
we should be able to see
the Big Sleeping Buddha.

358
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,180
Be careful.

359
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,740
I have explored caves for many years.

360
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
But this is my first time seeing this trap.

361
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
This is a double trap.

362
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,060
If you look down when you walk,

363
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,820
you can't see properly.

364
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,500
If you look at the Buddha's eyes,

365
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,020
you'll be hypnotized.

366
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,900
It uses some disturbing sights...

367
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,700
to seduce one's heart.

368
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,020
Those with slight distraction...

369
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,020
will lose themselves.

370
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,820
Despite practicing Taoism for years,

371
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,820
I also almost lost myself.

372
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,500
You're eager to get the bead,

373
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,180
which is understandable.

374
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:40,980
You...

375
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,940
should be more careful.

376
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,540
I know this.

377
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,700
This is Troxler Fading Effect.

378
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,700
In the year 1804,

379
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,460
a Swedish medical expert...

380
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,020
discovered something.

381
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,020
If someone stares...

382
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,700
at a fixed point for 20 seconds...

383
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,260
or more,

384
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,220
the image around this fixed point...

385
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,020
will slowly fade in the sight...

386
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,020
of the observer...

387
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,700
until it disappears at the end.

388
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,820
When we stare at the Buddha's eyes,

389
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,820
the eyes don't actually change.

390
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,260
But our nerve system...

391
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,700
would think that the message isn't important.

392
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,300
Hence, it blocks the message that conveys...

393
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,260
the image around the Buddha's eyes.

394
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
I thought that such things...

395
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,260
were first discovered by the westerners.

396
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,020
But the Chinese have been using them...

397
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,340
since 700 years ago.

398
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,260
Chinese are amazing.

399
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I'll go and find a path.

400
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,500
OK.

401
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,700
Be careful.

402
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,980
Mr. Thomas, come here.

403
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,220
