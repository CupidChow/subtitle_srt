00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,980
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,660
I never thought...

4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,180
there'd be a master like him...

5
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,820
living in this small county.

6
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,340
That old man...

7
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,020
was probably a famous person.

8
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,340
Why is a famous person...

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,540
living here?

10
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,340
This is unusual indeed.

11
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,820
You're right.

12
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,500
A strange fish was trying to kill us...

13
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,300
on our way here.

14
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,020
Not long after we arrived here...

15
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,940
that old blind man appeared.

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,020
Don't you...

17
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,980
Mr. Jin,

18
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,260
what are you thinking?

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm thinking about...

20
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,020
that poem he recited.

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,100
It's about Gentle hexagram.

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,980
Okay, forget about it.

23
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,020
We're not here for him.

24
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,620
At least we learnt something from him.

25
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,620
Here's the thing.

26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,020
We can't stay here for long.

27
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,300
We'll leave once we get things done.

28
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,300
And let's go to bed now.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,940
Don't.

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Wait a second.

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,780
I'm telling you.

32
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,460
No.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,660
I've finally understood...

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,060
that poem.

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,700
Look.

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,700
A lonely boat by...

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,780
The beach.

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes, the beach.

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,860
There's a barge pole but no water.

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,700
So, nothing can be done.

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,860
Yes.

42
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,580
The occasional rain...

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,500
The occasional rain makes the river rise.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,220
And the boat has passed by...

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,220
the mountains?

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,220
Now, one can move freely.

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,140
My father.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,700
You really think you're my father?

49
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,020
No, I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

50
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,940
What I'm saying is...

51
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,780
I've understood...

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
this poem.

53
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,940
You couldn't even memorize it.

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,220
What do you understand?

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,700
Yes, I didn't memorize it.

56
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,140
But I do know its meaning.

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,500
Look.

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,140
There's a barge pole...

59
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,500
but no water.

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,700
The river rises.

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,940
One can move freely.

62
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
What's the poem about?

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,060
What?

64
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,420
It talks about...

65
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,500
love between a man and woman.

66
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,780
That's not relevant at all.

68
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,860
No, it's relevant.

69
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,700
Mr. Jin, that's exactly...

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,780
what that old blind man was saying.

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,780
Okay.

72
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,180
Didn't he say something bad would happen?

73
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,020
He was talking about...

74
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,300
a woman.

75
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
What woman?

76
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,980
Could it be the American Girl?

77
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,260
Keep talking.

78
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,860
You just broke another car.

79
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,620
A car would break down...

80
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
whenever we talk about that girl.

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,460
I think you're right.

82
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,300
I was fooling with him.

83
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,300
Let's go to bed now.

84
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,900
Ms. Yang,

85
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,020
Professor Chen is very conscious today.

86
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,420
He wants to see you.

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,140
Okay, no problem.

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,460
Go back to your work, please.

89
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,460
Excuse me.

90
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,540
Uncle Chen, I have something to tell you.

91
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,900
I need to go on a trip.

92
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,260
So, please take good care of yourself.

93
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,700
And remember to eat and
take your medicine on time.

94
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,460
Get it?

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,620
A trip?

96
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,260
Where are you going?

97
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,020
I need to go to Beijing.

98
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,300
My friends are having some problems.

99
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,700
And they need my help.

100
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,860
Is this...

101
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,020
I found it in my grandfather's bedroom.

102
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,300
Do you know these symbols?

103
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,580
No, I don't.

104
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,180
But...

105
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,060
I heard that...

106
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,060
Right.

107
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,940
my friend Sun Yao Zu...

108
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,060
works at National Cultural
Heritage Administration.

109
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,820
He told me about this.

110
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,820
You should talk to him.

111
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Sun Yao Zu?

112
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,260
Two years ago,

113
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,580
during his archaeological
expedition at Shaanxi,

114
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,380
he excavated a lot of...

115
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,260
animal bones.

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,060
Among all those broken bones,

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,940
there's a huge tortoise shell.

118
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,300
It's the most perfect of all.

119
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,180
Similar symbols were found on that shell?

120
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,020
I heard the excavation team

121
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,820
moved those bones...

122
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,060
back to Beijing by flight.

123
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,060
But...

124
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,500
the military aircraft crashed.

125
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,940
Among the fifteen archaeologists,

126
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,620
he's the only survivor.

127
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,300
It's because...

128
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,740
he left his work journal...

129
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,820
at the guest house in the county.

130
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,060
And he decided to retrieve it.

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,180
That's why he missed the flight.

132
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Does Professor Sun...

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,940
know the meanings of these symbols?

134
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,820
We didn't...

135
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,500
disclose them to others.

136
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,500
There are only a few people know about them.

137
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,180
I think...

138
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
he...

139
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,620
probably...

140
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,060
No, I'm sure he knows.

141
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,580
We'll do the talking.

142
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,260
Don't talk.

143
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,380
You're just too generous.

144
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,740
He's here.

145
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,060
Brother Chun Lai, you're here.

146
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,260
And the stuffs are all here.

147
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,140
Please have a seat.

148
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,180
That's so nice of you all.

149
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
You're here at my county.

150
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,820
I should treat you to this meal.

151
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,820
Have a seat.

152
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,620
We're treating you to this...

153
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,820
because you didn't eat well...

154
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,060
while you're in Beijing.

155
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,060
It's all in the past.

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,620
Brother Chun Lai,

157
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,700
we can't let outsiders...

158
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,620
see these valuables.

159
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,620
So, please pardon us.

160
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,740
We can only meet...

161
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,500
in this private room.

162
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,740
That's right.

163
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,620
I don't mind.

164
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,820
Can we have another two bottles of beer?

165
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,940
Sure.

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,740
Comrade, another two bottles of beer.

167
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,500
Sure.

168
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,380
Yeah.

169
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
They're all here.

170
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,820
Great.

171
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,740
Brother Chun Lai,

172
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,740
let's check them out while eating.

173
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,300
Good idea.

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,500
Sure.

175
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,620
Let's do as your boss says.

176
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,620
I'll show you.

177
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
Brother Chun Lai,

178
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,060
didn't you show us this shoe...

179
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,740
while you're in Beijing?

180
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes, I did.

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,380
It's a pair of shoes.

182
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,300
I'll show you one by one.

183
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Brother Chun Lai,

184
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,940
look.

185
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,940
There are many antiques stalls in Beijing.

186
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,060
And you didn't make a deal with anyone.

187
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,940
But you decided to do so with Mr. Hu.

188
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,860
That's right.

189
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,740
It's called fate.

190
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
It's definitely fated.

191
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,260
Fate.

192
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,620
Surely, it's fated.

193
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,500
Since it's fated,

194
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,180
let's not beat around the bush.

195
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,820
Here's a price.

196
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,860
This pair of shoes...

197
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,380
is worth 300 yuan.

198
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,820
What?

199
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,820
While we are in Beijing,

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,380
your boss said that a shoe is worth 180 yuan.

201
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,700
It's 60 yuan short.

202
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,620
No, I can explain it.

203
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,620
Brother Chun Lai,

204
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,020
let's get this straight.

205
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,060
We suggested 180 yuan...

206
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,820
because...

207
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,740
you came all the way there to Beijing.

208
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,300
That's right.

209
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,180
But we didn't...

210
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,740
see this coming.

211
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,940
Besides,

212
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,300
we came all the way here to your county.

213
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,380
And we almost...

214
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,180
got killed before we made it here.

215
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,620
He's right.

216
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
I'm sure you still remember that.

217
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,020
Moreover, we're...

218
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,260
going to buy...

219
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,620
all of them.

220
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,500
So, you can't sell us each item for 180 yuan.

221
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,020
It should be cheaper than that.

222
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,620
He's right.

223
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,380
Mr. Hu also...

224
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,620
saved you.

225
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,780
Don't you remember it?

226
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,740
Here's your beer.

227
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,540
300 yuan for a pair of shoes!

228
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,380
Only 300 yuan!

229
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,900
Look,

230
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,020
Mr. Hu...

231
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,260
saved you...

232
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,780
by putting his life at risk.

233
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,500
He did.

234
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,860
He almost...

235
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,100
got himself killed.

236
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,260
You can't forget his kindness.

237
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,860
Am I right?

238
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,100
Please excuse me.

239
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm going to the toilet.

240
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,220
Sure. Go ahead.

241
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,500
You must repay his kindness.

242
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,620
He did save your life.

243
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,340
Is your life worth 60 yuan?

244
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,380
Can I buy your life for 60 yuan?

245
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,900
That's right.

246
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,660
It's 30 yuan short for each shoe.

247
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,140
You can't keep talking about 30 yuan.

248
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,980
Old man, why are you here?

249
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,260
You came out of nowhere. That's scary.

250
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,380
What's this?

251
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,620
You're giving it to me?

252
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,860
This is what you paid for.

253
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,860
I can't accept your money for no reason.

254
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,460
I drew you this talisman.

255
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,260
It's different from others.

256
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,020
Please accept it.

257
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,620
And that...

258
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,380
makes us even.

259
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,620
Stop thinking about 60 yuan.

260
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,620
Think about this instead.

261
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,380
Mr. Hu...

262
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,460
saved you, didn't he?

263
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,500
Did we ever ask you for...

264
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,380
his medical fee?

265
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,260
No, we didn't.

266
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,020
We paid for it ourselves.

267
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,620
We also paid...

268
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,380
the boatman 20 yuan for the boat ride.

269
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,540
You saw it.

270
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,020
You can't argue with that.

271
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,380
Yes.

272
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,620
All the dishes are served.

273
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,020
They're all served.

274
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,780
Fine, I'll sell it for 300 yuan.

275
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,860
I'm a reasonable man.

276
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,140
Brother Chun Lai, you finally get it.

277
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,900
Great.

278
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,980
Here, I'll pour you a glass of wine.

279
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,740
Mr. Jin.

280
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,460
Take a look at the thumb ring.

281
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,660
It looks nice.

282
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,620
Have a look at it.

283
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,540
See if there's anything special about it.

284
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,980
It doesn't look special at all.

285
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,140
Take a good look at it.

286
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,860
It could be a good stuff.

287
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,540
Right?

288
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,540
Let me have a look.

289
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,620
See its inside.

290
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,660
Inside?

291
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,460
Told you so.

292
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,020
Luckily, you reminded me.

293
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,140
I know right.

294
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,740
I didn't notice it.

295
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,740
It's better than the shoes.

296
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,020
In that case,

297
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,860
I'll buy this ring for 500 yuan.

298
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,780
Five hundred?

299
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,020
Five hundred? Let me take a look.

300
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,740
Why is it worth that price?

301
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,340
Take a look at this.

302
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,460
How much is it?

303
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,500
It's gold.

304
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,620
Is it that good?

305
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,500
Yes.

306
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,460
It's been such a long time...

307
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,860
since I came across...

308
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,380
such a great stuff.

309
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,860
Is it a good stuff?

310
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,780
It is worth...

311
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,100
800 yuan!

312
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,020
800?

313
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,860
Surely, you're having technical problem.

314
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,540
How did you know it is worth 800 yuan?

315
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,020
Eight hundred is the price. No bargain.

316
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,780
Eight hundred!

317
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,660
That's seven!

318
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,260
Eight!

319
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,460
Eight hundred? Deal.

320
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,260
Stop him, he's losing his mind.

321
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,980
Mr. Jin's gone crazy. Stop him now.

322
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,740
No, really...

323
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,020
you have to stop him.

324
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,980
Brother Chun Lai,

325
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
I have an idea.

326
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,140
We can't talk about each item here.

327
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,660
We'll buy all of them...

328
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,780
for a price.

329
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,620
Okay?

330
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,620
Listen to Mr. Hu.

331
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,540
How much?

332
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,980
10K.

333
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,340
What does that mean?

334
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,020
10,000 yuan.

335
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,100
10,000 yuan?

336
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,260
Brother!

337
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,260
What are you doing?

338
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,380
What are you doing?

339
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,460
Sure, that's a deal.

340
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,780
Brother Chun Lai, I'm sorry.

341
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,740
My brother...

342
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,020
never seen these many good stuffs.

343
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
He's being emotional.

344
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,980
Okay,

345
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,340
we'll take him back to the room.

346
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,380
And I'll go get you the money.

347
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,020
Please sit here...

348
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,780
and wait for us.

349
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Mr. Jin, carry him.

350
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,380
Where can I can 10,000 yuan?

351
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,780
Please wait for us.

352
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,020
Please wait.

353
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,540
Let's go, Fatty.

354
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,780
You'll be living a good life soon.

355
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,020
Be fast.

356
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,620
This is 300 yuan.

357
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,260
800 yuan.

358
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,220
500 yuan.

359
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,260
Awesome.

360
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,620
What are you doing?

361
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Mr. Hu, luckily I took your hint.

362
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,260
They're up to no good?

363
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,860
But there's no problem with those stuffs.

364
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
I found that waiter very fishy.

365
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,260
That's why I went out.

366
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,140
And I bumped into...

367
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,260
that old fortune-teller.

368
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,460
He gave me a talisman.

369
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,020
I took a quick look at it.

370
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,900
The lake is above,

371
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,540
water below.

372
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,140
The lake is empty, dried up.

373
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,100
This is an Oppression hexagram.

374
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,780
Oppression hexagram?

375
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,220
That means we're in grave danger.

376
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,500
There's something wrong with...

377
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,260
both Li Chun Lai and the waiter.

378
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,020
They kept looking at each other.

379
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,740
You're so observant.

380
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,860
It's a tactic known as fish-eating.

381
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,340
The seller would trick
a buyer using real antiques.

382
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,900
And the seller would kill the buyer
once he receives the money.

383
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,140
But we just met that old man.

384
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,380
Why did he help us?

385
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,660
It doesn't matter at all.

386
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,100
It's just too good to be true.

387
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,780
Let's go now.

388
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,740
Otherwise, we may die here.

389
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,460
Sure.

390
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,740
Baddie.

391
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,620
Where are they?

392
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,340
Why are you here?

393
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,900
Where are they?

394
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
They're getting us money.
We've closed the deal.

395
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,660
How much?

396
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,460
10K.

397
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,860
10K?

398
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,340
What does it mean?

399
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,900
I just picked it up.

400
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,460
10K means ten thousand.

401
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,340
Ma Da Dan,

402
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,740
surely you never thought that...

403
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,020
all of these could...

404
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,500
be worth 10,000 yuan.

405
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,380
You'll be a rich man soon!

406
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,220
You're definitely dreaming.

407
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,740
The second uncle of
your grandmother's Third Aunt...

408
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,340
can't even give you that much money!

409
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,460
Where are they staying?

410
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,780
Step aside!

411
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,620
Pull the door.

412
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,620
Brother,

413
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,500
look.

414
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,740
Ma Da Dan,

415
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,620
since they've run away, just forget about it.

416
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,860
We've lost nothing after all.

417
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,340
Nonsense!

418
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,500
What if they...

419
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,620
tell people about it?

420
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,020
I wouldn't be able to continue my business!

421
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,660
I want to quit.

422
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,220
I don't want the money either.

423
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,500
That's not what I was told.

424
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,740
We're all in the same boat.

425
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,980
You can't simply quit!

426
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,140
Go after them and their belongings!

427
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,540
No matter what,

428
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,140
you must catch them all!

429
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,620
Sir, what time is this bus leaving?

430
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,020
Don't feel anxious, a few more minutes.

431
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,300
Let's get on the bus first.

432
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,540
Go that way.

433
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,500
Please buy the tickets.

434
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,260
Behind there.

435
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,020
Behind there.

436
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,660
Buy the tickets.

437
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,780
Don't stick your head out the window. You wanna die?

438
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,180
Why am I paying for everything?

439
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,420
Because you're rich.

440
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,940
Old Hu,

441
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,660
is this necessary?

442
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,220
Maybe Blind Chen is fooling us.

443
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,260
I don't think so.

444
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,260
Let's go.

445
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,540
We can fight him.

446
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,660
I don't think.

447
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,740
Over there.

448
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,740
Come on. Quick.

449
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,180
Get down!

450
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,300
Why are you pulling my underwear?

451
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,660
Why are you pulling my underwear?

452
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,020
Stop pulling my underwear!

453
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,300
Fatty!

454
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,740
Run!

455
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,740
Old Jin!

456
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
Old Jin, get up.

457
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
Go get our men.

458
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
Stop!

459
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,740
Stop running!

460
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,260
Get them!

461
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,020
Stop!

462
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,940
Stop!

463
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,020
Stop running!

464
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Faster!

465
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,460
Stop running!

466
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Catch him!

467
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,780
Hurry!

468
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,260
Old Jin.

469
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
Stop!

470
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,260
Stop running!

471
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,420
Stop!

472
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Stop running!

473
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,780
Stop running!

474
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,820
Old Jin.

475
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,260
Stop.

476
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,100
Then stop chasing us.

477
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,220
He just threw up.

478
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,500
Come at me.

479
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,460
You bastard.

480
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,220
Go catch him!

481
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,340
He's coming, run!

482
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,020
Quick!

483
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,660
Stop!

484
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,700
Stop!

485
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,580
Stop!

486
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,580
Fatty, this way!

487
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,780
Stop!

488
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,020
Stop running!

489
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,500
Stop!

490
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,260
Stop running!

491
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,260
Cut the crap and teach them a good lesson!

492
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,060
Go!

493
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,180
You can't run now!

494
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,260
Oh, bloody hell!

495
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,020

Mr. Hu!

538
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,020
Run!

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,980

[The People Eatery]

542
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,820
Where are they?

543
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,740
See them?

544
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
No. No at all!

545
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,580
You, go over there!

546
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,020
Go.

547
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,460
They're gone. Let's take a rest.

548
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
I'm so tired.

549
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
It is so stuck.

550
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,260
We should have fought until the end.

551
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,940
I'm not afraid of anyone.

552
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,180
I'm sure I can deal with them.

553
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,020
It's obvious that they're all hooligans.

554
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,820
We couldn't fight barehanded.

555
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,740
You know,

556
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
Chairman Mao was right.

557
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,740
Power grows from the barrel of the gun.

558
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,580
Are you alright, Old Jin?

559
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,500
Mr. Jin, have some water.

560
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,020
Li Chun Lai is such a scoundrel.

561
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,780
On the surface, he's an honest man.

562
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,060
Actually, he's a baddie.

563
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,260
Did you hear that?

564
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,940
Li Chun Lai called the ringleader...

565
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,500
Ma Da Dan.

566
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,260
On the same night,

567
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,940
Ma Da Dan along with his coffin shop...

568
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,020
and his followers...

569
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,220
were struck by lightning.

570
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,500
His followers were all dead.

571
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,820
I remember it.

572
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,220
Isn't Ma Da Dan...

573
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,820
the coffin shop boss who was killed by lightning?

574
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,460
They made that up.

575
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,180
Li Chun Lai is simply a minion.

576
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
Surely Ma Da Dan...

577
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,340
is the one who planned out everything.

578
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,300
The story of digging the coffin,
beating the god of drought for rain

579
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,500
is a trick.

580
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,740
Old Hu,

581
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,540
who should we do now?

582
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,340
Think of a way.
