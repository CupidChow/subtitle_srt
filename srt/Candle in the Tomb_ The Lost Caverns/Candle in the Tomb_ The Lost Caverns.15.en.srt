00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,740
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,670
Why are you crying?

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,670
Figure it out.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,760
Look.

6
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,600
Since you can come down,

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,120
that means it's a closed circle.

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Theoretically,

9
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,160
closed steps should ascend,

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,320
why do we keep going down?

11
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,200
This must be...

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,150
a mechanism that we don't understand.

13
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,520
In my half copy of 16 Words Yin & Yang Occult,

14
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,640
the Escape-Character Formula...

15
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,470
mentioned some ancient mechanisms.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
I remembered it.

17
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,670
This is the Soul Hanging Ladder.

18
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,240
The Soul Hanging Ladder?

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,150
It was deduced by the Yi numbers...

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,350
during the Western Zhou period.

21
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,390
Its purpose is to trap people.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,280
I suddenly recalled...

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
I dealt with an ancient book...

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,070
that mentioned mechanisms,

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,040
including Soul Hanging Ladder.

26
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,680
It's just like what we're encountering now,

27
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,000
walking in a circle and failing to leave.

28
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,790
Then, what's next?

29
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,790
Did it mention the solution?

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,760
I wasn't interested in that,

31
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,350
so I sold the book.

32
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,760
What you said were useless.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,680
I think...

34
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,350
we should close our eyes and cover our head...

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,920
and roll down the stairs. That will do, right?

36
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,640
Enough.

37
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,400
It's an endless loop.

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,120
Even if you rolled outside...

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,710
and the four modernizations were realized,

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,840
you can't leave.

41
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,840
Every method doesn't work.

42
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,350
Fine.

43
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,760
We'll starve to death here...

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,560
and wait for the next group to find our bodies.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,710
If I knew I'd starve to death here,

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,430
I would have drunk the mercury up there.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,280
Third Brother.

48
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,870
if we had another life,

49
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,350
I would never leave Beijing no matter what.

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,280
Old Jin, why are you crying?

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,000
Even if we die, we'll die as a brave man.

52
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't be like the others at the back,

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,950
chirping like girls.

54
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,360
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,960
You.

56
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,240
Say it again.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,190
Talking about you.

58
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,630
What?

59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,150
You. So what?

60
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,150
Say it again.

61
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,840
What's going on?

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,430
I have a solution.

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,710
Brother,

64
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,000
let me tell you.

65
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,430
We can neither...

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,960
move forward...

67
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,560
nor...

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,190
move backwards.

69
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,680
But it's empty on both sides.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,470
Let's just send someone to jump.

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,190
No way.

72
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,470
Both sides are bottomless abysses.

73
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,240
We don't know how deep they are.

74
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,310
It's dangerous to act recklessly.

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,360
It's better than doing nothing.

76
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,190
You're the most useless one here.

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,910
You should jump.

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,710
No, if you want me to jump,

79
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,630
why don't you shoot me with a gun?

80
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
Ma Da Dan,

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,560
if you dare to hurt Old Jin,

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,240
I will...

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
force you to jump now.

84
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,080
If you dare to hurt my brother, I'll kill you.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,680
What?

86
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,680
Do it.

87
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,710
Come on. Do it.

88
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,430
Come on. Together!

89
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm not afraid of that.

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Come on!

91
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,560
Enough. Stop it.

92
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,520
I will do it.

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,280
Tie me with the rope.

94
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,470
I won't dare to do that, Mr. Hu.

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,400
Eldest Brother,

96
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
this Mojin Xiaowei is useful.

97
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,680
We mustn't let him go down.

98
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,000
Shut up.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,680
If he...

100
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,750
You can't go down.

101
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,030
You're important to me.

102
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,680
If you want to die, do it when we leave here.

103
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
You go down then.

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
I can't go down either.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,630
I'll do it.

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,080
Tenth Brother.

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
You'll do it then.

108
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,590
Tie him tightly.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,680
Got it.

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,150
Sixth Brother, tie him tightly.

111
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,240
Brothers, hold it tight.

112
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,520
Don't worry, we're here.

113
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,560
Don't worry.

114
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Hold it tight.

115
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,710
Hold it.

116
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,240
Release.

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,920
We did it.

118
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,950
Hold it tight.

119
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,600
Release more.

120
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,870
More.

121
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,480
Release.

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,480
Release.

123
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,630
Release more.

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,830
Have you reached there?

125
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,630
Have you?

126
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,870
Not yet.

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
No?

128
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,750
Release more.

129
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,720
Hold it tight.

130
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,830
Third brother, release.

131
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
How is it?

132
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,480
Release more.

133
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,480
Third brother.

134
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,190
Are you there?

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,750
No.

136
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,800
Release more.

137
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,120
Release.

138
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,240
Have you reached there?

139
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,830
Not yet.

140
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,680
Hold it tight.

141
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
Have you reached there?

142
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,310
Still no.

143
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,270
Hold on it.

144
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,560
Still no?

145
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,720
More.

146
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,360
Third brother, release.

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,430
More.

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,480
Tenth brother, have you reached there?

149
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,720
We can't see you anymore.

150
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,680
Response if you hear us.

151
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,800
Eldest Brother,

152
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,560
this 100-metre rope

153
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,390
is going to be the end.

154
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,920
Why hasn't he been at the bottom yet?

155
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,800
What should we do?

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,720
It can't work. Pull him up.

157
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
That's right, Brother.

158
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Oh, no.

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,270
We really can't leave this place for real.

160
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,920
I haven't had a wife yet.

161
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,830
Shut up.

162
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,630
Why are you so useless?

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,310
Brother,

164
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,160
let him cry.

165
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,800
If we knew we'd be in this situation,

166
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,070
we wouldn't have come here.

167
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,830
Making a small living...

168
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,510
is better than dying here.

169
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,190
Fourth Brother, what are you talking about?

170
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,720
Are you blaming our eldest brother?

171
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,510
Our live and death depend on the Heavens.

172
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,430
If we die,

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,040
we should die together,

174
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,720
got it?

175
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,390
If we are brothers...

176
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Hold on to it.

177
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,830
he shouldn't lead us to a dead end.

178
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,680
You're a coward.

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,310
Tenth Brother.

180
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,270
Tenth Brother.

181
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,510
Pull him up.

182
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,680
You're not afraid of dying,

183
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,480
but we are.

184
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,190
I call him "Eldest Brother",

185
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,360
because we can earn money following him.

186
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,240
Do you think he thinks of you as his brother?

187
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,630
Yes, you're right. I...

188
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,630
Go to hell.

189
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
Rope. The rope.

190
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,270
The rope.

191
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,270
Tenth Brother.

192
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,360
Tenth Brother.

193
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,920
Tenth Brother.

194
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,160
What...?

195
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,920
Tenth Brother.

196
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,190
My brother...

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
Tenth Brother.

198
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Tenth Brother.

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,120
Tenth Brother.

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
My brother.

201
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,240
That unreliable fool.

202
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes, I'm talking about you.

203
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,750
Someone died.

204
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,270
If you keep doing this, all of us will die.

205
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,680
You're a coward.

206
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,310
Why are you still being sarcastic?

207
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,950
Look at your face.

208
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,240
You look like an overturned motorcycle.

209
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,160
If you dare to go against my brother,

210
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,120
I'll blast you with a bomb.

211
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,120
Brother, I'll have to kill him.

212
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,190
Blast me. Kill me.

213
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,600
I'll kill you too.

214
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,750
Come on. Blast me.

215
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,310
I will blast you to death.

216
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,120
I'll kill you too.

217
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,630
You'll die first.

218
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,800
You'll die first.

219
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,000
I know how to get out.

220
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,870
If you don't want to die, follow me.

221
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,120
Just wait and see.

222
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,870
Brother.

223
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,270
Eldest Brother,

224
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,310
why don't...

225
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,160
we follow them first?

226
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,870
Scoundrel.

227
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,630
Brother.

228
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,120
Didn't you say you have an idea?

229
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,600
Say it.

230
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,960
The way out is not in front. It's underneath.

231
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,600
What do you mean?

232
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,030
Just like your solution,

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
jump.

234
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,840
What?

235
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,910
My tenth brother just died,
but you still insist on jumping?

236
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,200
It's not about jumping or not.

237
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,670
It's about where to jump.

238
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,030
Let me tell you, Ma Da Dan,

239
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
Old Hu's solution

240
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
is never wrong.

241
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,320
If you want to survive, shut up...

242
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,390
and follow him.

243
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,600
I was thinking, this 384...

244
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,550
shouldn't be a random number.

245
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Taiji produces two forms, yin and yang.

246
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,630
These two forms produce the Four Symbols.

247
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,200
The Four Symbols act on the Eight Trigrams.

248
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,390
The Eight Trigrams result in...

249
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,960
64 hexagrams.

250
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,630
Every hexagram is composed of
six stacked horizontal lines.

251
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,270
There are 384 lines in total,

252
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,270
which corresponds to the 384 steps.

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
Moreover, look closely.

254
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,870
Every step

255
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,150
has imperceptible changes
in the color of the shading.

256
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,440
It should be used to differentiate
between yin and yang.

257
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,390
The darker color is yang...

258
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,790
and the lighter color is yin.

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,750
Yin and yang?

260
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,360
You mean...

261
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,960
according to the color,

262
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,440
the steps can be a hexagram?

263
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,240
That's right.

264
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,720
If the step with a crescent...

265
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,030
is the starting point,

266
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,200
384 steps...

267
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,200
corresponds to the 64 hexagrams.

268
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,870
If we want to crack the mechanism,

269
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,750
we have to find...

270
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,510
the correct hexagram...

271
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,630
out of the 64 hexagrams.

272
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,030
So what kind of hexagram are we in now?

273
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
If I guess it correctly,

274
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,150
it should be the one that
alludes to our situation,

275
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,440
the Oppression hexagram.

276
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,390
But, there are six steps for it.

277
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,600
From which step should we jump?

278
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,480
According to Mr. Hu's analysis,

279
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,670
there should only be one correct step.

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,320
The others are wrong, right?

281
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,360
That's right.

282
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
The Oppression hexagram, fifth from the bottom.

283
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,790
It's here.

284
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,670
The Oppression hexagram, fifth from the bottom.

285
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,840
We have to solve the oppression first.

286
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,840
The Oppression hexagram's top is
Joyous and the bottom is Abysmal.

287
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,510
The fifth line is yang line.

288
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,600
If the yang line becomes a yin line,

289
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,200
the Oppression hexagram would
become the Deliverance hexagram.

290
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,320
Do you think we are fools?

291
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,080
We don't know if we will survive after jumping.

292
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,790
Since I suggest it,

293
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,320
of course, I will jump first.

294
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
No.

295
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,910
We must jump together.

296
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,720
I can't let you die first.

297
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,480
Mojin Xiaowei, united we stand, divided we fall.

298
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,270
Let's jump together.

299
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,870
Yes.

300
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Let me finish talking.

301
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,670
If we jump from this step,

302
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,480
the Oppression hexagram will
become the Deliverance hexagram.

303
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,240
The Deliverance hexagram means
the resolution to a difficult situation.

304
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,030
So, the chance is bigger here.

305
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,150
Count back three steps from here.

306
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,790
This is the Gathering hexagram.

307
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,870
The Gathering hexagram
means people come together...

308
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,270
and everything will go smoothly.

309
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,550
There's also a chance of survival.

310
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,150
But, I'm not sure which one it is.

311
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
So, I can only choose one to jump.

312
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,550
If I go down...

313
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,390
and my choice is wrong,

314
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,910
then you can jump from the other one.

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
If that is wrong too...

316
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,960
Anyway, I will die first.

317
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,320
That's my atonement.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,270
Let's meet at the bottom.

319
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,200
No way.

320
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,200
We set some rules before we came down.

321
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,080
Chief Yang,

322
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,270
let Old Hu jump.

323
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,030
You...

324
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Old Hu,

325
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,390
I know what you're thinking about.

326
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,390
Don't worry.

327
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,910
If you die ahead of us,

328
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,080
I will bring them out alive.

329
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,000
Moreover,

330
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,080
you won't die.

331
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,510
Heard that? I won't die.

332
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,390
If you thought it through, go ahead and jump.

333
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,960
You...

334
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,870
Won't we jump together?

335
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,360
Nonsense.

336
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
Remember this spot.

337
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,550
Hu Ba Yi.

338
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,960
Mr. Hu.

339
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,030
Mr. Hu.

340
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,000
Hu Ba Yi.

341
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,320
Old Hu.

342
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
He did jump.

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,960
Hu Ba Yi.

344
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,630
Mr. Hu.

345
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,510
Hu Ba Yi.

346
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,840
Mr. Hu.

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,080
Hu Ba Yi.

348
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,870
Oh, no.

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,320
The Mojin Xiaowei is gone.

350
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,080
Shut up.

351
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,870
Hu Ba Yi.

352
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,150
Old Hu.

353
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,720
Come down.

354
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,510
Old Hu, answer me.

355
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,670
You scared me.

356
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Enough, I''m going down.

357
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,870
Make way.

358
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,080
I'll go down first.

359
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,750
Here.

360
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,840
Give some light.

361
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,240
Here.

362
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,790
Old Hu.

363
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,200
Look.

364
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,840
It's the same down here.

365
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
There isn't any path.

366
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,840
Look around.

367
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
Aren't these paths?

368
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,550
There isn't any light-absorbing coating.

369
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,550
We can see further.

370
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,550
Hu Ba Yi, you're really capable.

371
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,120
Yes.

372
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,080
This isn't a safe place.

373
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Let's leave.

374
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,320
Okay, let's go.

375
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,960
We finally got through another obstacle.

376
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,000
But, why are we...

377
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,030
in the lost caverns again?

378
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Enough, Fatty.

379
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,750
We're lucky enough

380
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,960
to escape from the steps.

381
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,510
That's right.

382
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,550
Old Hu.

383
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,120
I really admire you.

384
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,550
You're smart.

385
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,870
I made the right decision to follow you.

386
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,550
Without that crescent,

387
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,270
we would have died there.

388
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,840
Crescent?

389
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,750
You mean there was an immortal guiding us.

390
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,270
You discovered it now?

391
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,360
The mystery here...

392
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,270
isn't as simple as what we thought.

393
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,320
Old Hu,

394
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,200
what does this look like?

395
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,480
The Soul Hanging Ladder.

396
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
There are many things...

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that I still don't understand.

398
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,270
I've never seen a tomb like this.

399
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,030
Why is there something from
the Western Zhou period...

400
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,030
in a Tang dynasty tomb?

401
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,830
And,

402
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,000
how did the entrance to the tomb disappear?

403
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,640
How can we explain that?

404
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,960
The only explanation is that before Li Chun Feng,

405
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,750
there was a Western Zhou tomb here.

406
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,400
You mean Li Chun Feng seized the tomb for himself?

407
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
Li Chun Feng wasn't that selfish...

408
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,000
to ruin the Western Zhou tomb.

409
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,310
He must have added his tomb...

410
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,750
based on the Western Zhou tomb.

411
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,590
So, the tomb has the Tang dynasty style...

412
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,310
and Western Zhou elements.

413
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,550
What about the entrance that disappeared?

414
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,440
These murals

415
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,000
have given us the answer.

416
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,920
What are the secrets behind the murals?

417
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,550
Look at this. Does it look like
an armillary sphere?

418
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,750
Armillary sphere?

419
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,790
These murals...

420
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,070
are the structures of the upper tomb.

421
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,030
Although it's a little abstract,

422
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,720
the design concept...

423
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,160
is like the armillary sphere.

424
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,590
You mean...

425
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,750
the whole tomb can spin slowly?

426
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,790
That's right.

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,270
At regular intervals,

428
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,590
the entrance would change its location.

429
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,750
It's not that the entrance disappeared,

430
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,720
it just turns to another location.

431
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,030
To make a tomb spin?

432
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,270
There isn't any power supply.
This doesn't make sense.

433
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,240
Build-in Well.

434
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,750
That means there's a spring here.

435
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,510
If there's a spring,
there should be an underground river here.

436
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,240
It should be possible...

437
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,590
using hydraulic power.

438
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
Mr. Hu,

439
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,160
Mojin Xiaowei,

440
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm convinced. You're awesome!

441
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,750
Hu Ba Yi,

442
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,920
you're our life saviour.

443
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,030
We'll listen to you from now on.

444
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,790
We'll follow wherever you go.

445
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,110
Yes.

446
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,960
Brother, I'll follow you.

447
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,680
Ma Da Dan,

448
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,480
let's discuss and walk together.

449
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,880
There are only two paths.

450
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,240
Which one

451
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,200
do you choose?

452
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
I think...

453
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,310
we should go this way.

454
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,790
That way.

455
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,830
Look, you said we should discuss, right?

456
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,750
We must take this path.

457
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,590
You.

458
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,880
This path.

459
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,960
Third Brother.

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,830
Brother, come here.

461
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,590
We really must take this path.

462
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,790
Eighth Brother.

463
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,070
Hurry. Go.

464
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,830
Wait, my...

465
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Hu...Hui Ba Yi,

466
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,000
what to do now?

467
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
We're under siege.

468
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,510
What should we do, brother?

469
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,960
The Hall of Hell is ahead.

470
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,750
It's our only way out.

471
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,400
Brother,

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,440
I was right to bring many bombs.

473
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,000
Old Hu,

474
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,440
what idea do you have this time?

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,160
I don't have any.

476
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,590
Don't say that.

477
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,310
Can you cheer us up?

478
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,160
Sure.

479
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,240
The only way...

480
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,510
is to go against them.

481
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,830
Fourth Brother.

482
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,750
Gun.

483
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,830
Listen carefully.

484
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,270
Our goal is not to kill the spiders.

485
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,160
We have to try our best
to go through the opposite door.

486
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,240
What are you doing?

487
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,160
Explosive.

488
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,830
Great!

489
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,510
Great.

490
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,960
Second Brother.

491
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720
Second Brother, be careful.

492
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,830
Run.

493
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,270
Fatty.

494
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,200
Go.

495
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,510
Follow them.

496
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,510
Stop it.

497
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,350
It's great.

498
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,920
Go.

499
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,400
Second brother.

500
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,790
Run.

501
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,160
Run.

502
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,880
Second brother.

503
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,310
Ma Da Dan.

504
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,270
I'm not afraid of death.

505
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,400
Be careful. Stay away.

506
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,030
Fatty.

507
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,640
Go.

508
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,160
Fatty.

509
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,640
Fatty.

510
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,830
Fatty.

511
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,400
Let me warm you up.

512
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
Eldest Brother.

513
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,720
Sixth Brother.

514
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,550
Sixth Brother.

515
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
Sixth Brother.

516
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,030
Sixth Brother.

517
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm dead.

518
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,070
I still want to be your brother in the next life.

519
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,680
Run with the bullets.

520
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
Hurry, go into the Hall of Hell.

521
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,200
Fatty.

522
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,750
Fatty, quick!

523
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,350
Hurry.

524
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,680
Go.

525
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,790
Mr. Jin.

526
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,030
They are afraid.

527
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Don't bother...

528
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,880
as long as they don't come after us.

529
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
