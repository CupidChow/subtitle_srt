00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,900
Chun Lai,

5
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,100
come and help!

6
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,020
Stop being a lazybone!

7
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,180
We're lifting the coffin soon!

8
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,980
Let's go!

9
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,900
Here!

10
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,020
It's out!

11
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,380
Hurry up!

12
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,620
It is out.

13
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,300
Li Chun Lai, get down there and help!

14
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,540
Do it yourself!

15
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,100
Look at that coffin.

16
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,020
Look.

17
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,460
Come, quick!

18
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
Pull it!

19
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,740
Here!

20
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,540
Hurry up!

21
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
One, two, three!

22
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,900
One, two, three!

23
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,460
One, two, three!

24
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,780
Open the coffin!

25
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,380
Hurry up.

26
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,380
We have to beat the god of drought up
to make it rain.

27
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,580
Open the coffin now!

28
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,660
You all cowards.

29
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,540
What are you waiting for?

30
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,660
Let's open it now!

31
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,980
One, two, lift!

32
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
What's that?

33
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,220
It's moving!

34
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,820
What's that?

35
00:05:59,340 --> 00:05:59,980
What's that?

36
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,340
Are we good now?

37
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,460
Brother.

38
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,900
Quick!

39
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,100
Get the whip!

40
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,460
It is gone.

41
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,460
We've just whipped the god of draught.
And now it's going to rain!

42
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,220
God bless us all!

43
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,260
God bless us all!

44
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
God bless us all!

45
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,260
Village Chief!

46
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,900
It's going to rain!

47
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,460
What should we do with the coffin?

48
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,700
Burn it.

49
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,260
What?

50
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,460
There're so many good stuffs in it.

51
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,660
This woman died...

52
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,340
while...

53
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,140
having a baby.

54
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,380
Both of them have been living under the earth.

55
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,020
They're ghost mother and child.

56
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,340
And they're very powerful.

57
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,020
So, we must...

58
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,460
get rid of this coffin.

59
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,580
Ghost mother and child.

60
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,700
Chun Lai!

61
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,660
You'll stay here and burn the coffin.

62
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,700
Me?

63
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,900
I'll do it alone?

64
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,660
Any problem?

65
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,020
Yes, you'll do it alone.

66
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,900
I need some helpers!

67
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,100
You...

68
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,700
Remember.

69
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,340
Don't take anything in it,

70
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,100
otherwise...

71
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,540
karma will get you back.

72
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,580
Let's go back.

73
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,340
Now!

74
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,140
Let's go.

75
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,220
Let's go back.

76
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,460
Stop looking at it!

77
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,900
Go back now!

78
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,220
Mind your own business.

79
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,980
Go back now.

80
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,580
Now!

81
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,980
Ma Da Dan!

82
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,980
Why are you here!?

[BeiJing]

84
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,020
After Hu Ba Yi and Wang Kai Xuan...

85
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,140
came back from the Ancient City of Jingjue,

86
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,660
they started selling antiques...

87
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,020
at the antiques market...

88
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,180
with the financial help from Shirley Yang.

89
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,180
However,

90
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,820
even though...

91
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,780
they're both good at treasure hunting,

92
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,420
they're not so skilled...

93
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,620
at doing business.

94
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,460
You've been here for so long.

95
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,460
So, are you buying?

96
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,860
I like this one so much.

97
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,340
Yeah? Anything you like?

98
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,340
Pretty nice.

99
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,500
Pretty nice, yeah?

100
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Yeah, I like it.

101
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,420
How much?

102
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,100
How much is this?

103
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,180
Three thousand.

104
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,620
Three thousand.

105
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,940
It's quite a lot.

106
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,700
It's too expensive.

107
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
How could it be so expensive?
It's just a market.

108
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,340
Yes, this is just a market.

109
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,580
But that's a good stuff.

110
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,980
He said it's a very good thing.

111
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,100
It's a Ming Dynasty antique.

112
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,460
Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasty.

113
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,580
It's been hundreds of years.

114
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,820
That's how old this antique is.

115
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,420
Ask him if he knows Monroe.

116
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,180
Monroe from the Ming Dynasty owned it.

117
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,100
That's what makes it very meaningful.

118
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,460
There's only one in the world.

119
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,220
There's only one in this world.

120
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,220
Yes, only one.

121
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,340
Isn't it too much?

122
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,860
Brother, it's just too expensive.

123
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,620
Be favorable.

124
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,700
Ms., you're from Northeast China,
aren't you?

125
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,740
We're all Chinese.

126
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,460
We must take care of each other,

127
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,060
mustn't we?

128
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,580
What a cost.

129
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,860
Let's do this instead.

130
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,580
He pays three thousand
and you'll get one thousand.

131
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,740
Deal?

132
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,820
Brother,

133
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,700
I heard what you just said.

134
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,180
You're so dishonest.

135
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,740
Did you just call me dishonest?

136
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,700
You're dishonest indeed.

137
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,700
He knows Mandarin.

138
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,740
Why are you being his translator?

139
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,460
You...

140
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,340
Did you see that?

141
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,100
That foreigner just called me dishonest.

142
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,180
What a humiliation.

143
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,340
Welcome.

144
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,940
Stop being a hands-off leader.

145
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,820
Be more hardworking.

146
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,500
I can't deal with...

147
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,820
all this by myself, Old Hu.

148
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,340
We're going to...

149
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,820
do business here for some time.

150
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,060
I can earn more...

151
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,980
from selling cassette tapes.

152
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,580
Boss, how much is this?

153
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,340
5 yuan.

154
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,700
That's too expensive.

155
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,180
Expensive?

156
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,820
Do you believe

157
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,580
I said no to the one who
wanted to buy it with 3,000 yuan.

158
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,340
You've been acting this way since we
came back from Ancient City of Jingjue.

159
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,300
Why, Old Hu?

160
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,220
You don't want to do this anymore?

161
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,580
Please don't...

162
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,580
waste your talent.

163
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,220
As the saying goes,

164
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,340
a talented man will succeed
with help from the right one.

165
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,300
Look at that man.

166
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,460
Which one?

167
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,300
That one.

168
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,420
He's between thirty to forty years old.

169
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,580
He has purplish-red skin.

170
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,940
Surely, he's a farmer...

171
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,100
working at a half plateau region.

172
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,980
If I'm not mistaken,

173
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,580
that brother is from Loess Plateau.

174
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,060
You're really something.

175
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,820
You're truly a scout.

176
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,820
No wonder you're unusually observant.

177
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,700
Of course.

178
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,460
That shabby-looking man...

179
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,580
has a worn-out bag with him.

180
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,740
He's been lingering around here
for more than a week.

181
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,460
And you notice him now?

182
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,980
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,220
You're not here all the time.

184
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,460
Anything suspicious?

185
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,580
No, look at him.

186
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,620
Those who're eager to sell their items...

187
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,220
are usually secretive.

188
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,420
Because they're afraid of swindlers or robbers.

189
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,340
That brother is one of that kind.

190
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,180
Surely, he wants to sell it as soon as possible.

191
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,940
8 yuan.

192
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,580
Deal?

193
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,060
There are not many customers on Mondays.

194
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,820
Our business won't do well anyway.

195
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,580
Why don't...

196
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,220
we make fun of him?

197
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,500
Don't bully an honest man like him.

198
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,820
I was just joking.

199
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,820
Let's go.

200
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,220
Brother, please look after my stall.

201
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,500
One pancake.

202
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,100
More scallion.

203
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,060
More sauce. No egg.

204
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,180
Don't move.

205
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,340
We're police.

206
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,220
No, I won't move.

207
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,100
Turn around.

208
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,860
Where are you from?

209
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,340
Shaanxi.

210
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,340
What's your name?

211
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,580
Li Chun Lai.

212
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,340
Do you have any letter of introduction?

213
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,500
You're scaring him.

214
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,180
What letter?

215
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,580
Brother Chun Lai.

216
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,460
We sell antiques here too.

217
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,220
Are you selling something?

218
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
We can talk.

219
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,580
No.

220
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm not a baddie.

221
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,940
No, we're catching you.

222
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,220
We want to do business with you.

223
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,220
Mr. Policeman.

224
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,100
No, I said I wasn't a policeman.

225
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,340
We're just fooling you.

226
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,340
Also,

227
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,580
we don't look like policemen at all.

228
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,340
Policemen would be
ashamed of what we look like.

229
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes.

230
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,580
You're right.

231
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,220
Wait.

232
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,100
Brother Chun Lai,

233
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,460
I know you're selling something.

234
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,460
There are so many people here.

235
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,100
Let's talk somewhere else.

236
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,460
A place where...

237
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,340
we can talk while having instant-boiled mutton.

238
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,340
Instant-boiled mutton?

239
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,460
Sure.

240
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,860
Come, eat.

241
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,980
Eat.

242
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,860
Eat.

243
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,140
Eat more.

244
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,980
Come on, eat.

245
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,780
Here, let's drink.

246
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,060
Brother Chun Lai.

247
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,460
You've been lingering around...

248
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,980
the market for some time.

249
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,660
Are you selling something?

250
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,700
Can we take a look at it?

251
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,220
I have a shoe.

252
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,900
But I'm not sure if it's valuable.

253
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,860
A child?

254
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
A shoe.

255
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,180
I got quite a shock.

256
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,620
I thought you're selling a child.

257
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,780
What shoe is it?

258
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,460
Brother, that's too much.

259
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,700
I didn't see anything at all.

260
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,260
Brother Six.

261
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,460
One more plate of mutton.

262
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,780
Sure.

263
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,380
Brother Chun Lai,

264
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,700
here's the thing.

265
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,500
If that shoe...

266
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,140
is important enough,

267
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,620
it will worth a lot of money.

268
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,500
Right?

269
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,500
By then, you'll get to eat mutton every single day.

270
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,220
One plate of rib.

271
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,500
Sure.

272
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,500
Brother Six, the mutton is cut nicely.

273
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,500
Eat slowly.

274
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,460
Thank you.

275
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,700
Wait.

276
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,180
It's not cooked yet.

277
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,260
Yes, it's not cooked yet.

278
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,220
Let's boil it for a while.

279
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
I'd get unwell...

280
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,380
from having mutton daily.

281
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,700
I wish that...

282
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,180
I'd sell this shoe at a good price...

283
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,700
before going back to my hometown.

284
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,700
Then I'd get married and give birth to a child.

285
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,740
And that's my idea of perfect life.

286
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,740
Isn't there a saying from your hometown?

287
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,540
It goes like this.

288
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,020
Mizhi women are beautiful.
Suide men are handsome.

289
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,140
If you manage to sell that shoe at a good price,

290
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,180
you get to marry a Mizhi woman.

291
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,380
Right?

292
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,500
Anyway,

293
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,140
you should let us take a look at it.

294
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,140
We can't buy it without doing so.

295
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,380
That's right.

296
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,900
Now you've seen it.

297
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Where did you get that shoe?

298
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
I came from a place called Gulan County.

299
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,540
And we've been having...

300
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,180
a serious drought.

301
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,460
Our village chief said that...

302
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,540
we needed to beat the god of drought up
to make it rain.

303
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,740
What god?

304
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,700
God of drought?

305
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,540
Yes.

306
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,380
It means beating dead bodies up.

307
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
It's a custom practiced at many remote areas...

308
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,860
during the pre-Liberation era.

309
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,420
Then?

310
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,540
We were digging the earth for days...

311
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
at the eastern side of village.

312
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,540
And we discovered a huge coffin.

313
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,620
Ma Da Dan didn't want me to tell others about it.

314
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,900
He then took a shoe placed on the dead body...

315
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,780
and gave it to me...

316
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
as hush money.

317
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,980
On the same night,

318
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,620
Ma Da Dan along with his coffin shop...

319
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,700
and his followers...

320
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,940
were struck by lightning.

321
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,660
And they were all dead.

322
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,980
I think it's a punishment...

323
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,420
from God.

324
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,500
Their dead bodies were...

325
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,540
as black as charcoal.

326
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,980
You're such...

327
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,700
a good storyteller.

328
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,660
I must admit that,

329
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,700
among the hardworking workers in this country,

330
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,460
you're good at making up stories.

331
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
I've ever met one in my life.

332
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,900
I didn't lie to you!

333
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,860
Why are you feeling panic?

334
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,980
Hey, Fatty.

335
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,460
Brother Chun Lai,

336
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,860
judging from what you said,

337
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,900
I can see that...

338
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
this shoe has an interesting origin.

339
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,940
I've seen the shoe.

340
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,860
And I never thought a hundred-year-old shoe...

341
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,300
could be that well-preserved.

342
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,420
It's very rare indeed.

343
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,500
I've come across several pairs.

344
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,660
They all looked like bark.

345
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,980
But...

346
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,780
a good piece of antique must be a complete one.

347
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,220
Same goes to other things.

348
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,300
A thing worth more money if it's complete.

349
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,180
You only have one of the shoes.

350
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,660
In other words,

351
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,660
it's not complete without another one.

352
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,460
Boss,

353
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,980
you said it's more than one hundred years old.

354
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,380
Is it very valuable?

355
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,980
Brother Chun Lai.

356
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,460
To be honest,

357
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,620
our business isn't doing so well.

358
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,940
You've seen it yourself.

359
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,860
We're eating more mutton than you are.

360
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,660
It's been a long while since we last had it.

361
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,740
And we don't know...

362
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,260
when we'll have it again.

363
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,740
We're sorry...

364
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,300
for saying that.

365
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,300
I've taken a look at the shoe.

366
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,700
And it's not bad.

367
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,860
You've been here for days.

368
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,060
You should know by now...

369
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,540
how much it worth.

370
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,140
Let's do this instead.

371
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,380
We'll go...

372
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,180
see a professional friend of mine.

373
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,260
Let him take a look at it and suggest a price.

374
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,180
That'll be fair for us all.

375
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,220
What say you?

376
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,780
Brother, listen here.

377
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,140
You can go ask around.

378
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,460
Among all the sellers here,

379
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,220
both of us are the honest one.

380
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,060
Others? Not at all.

381
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,980
That's right.

382
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,940
Brother Chun Lai, don't worry.

383
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,860
I like farmers a lot.

384
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,300
Do you know?

385
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,860
My father...

386
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,060
dropped out of his study...

387
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,300
and fought for the liberation of our farmers...

388
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
by becoming a revolutionary.

389
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,980
His father's a veteran.

390
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,620
My father's a revolutionary for his whole life.

391
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,620
Moreover,

392
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,660
he himself...

393
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,300
came from a working-class family.

394
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,540
Stop it.

395
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,380
Our revolution...

396
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,460
started in villages, followed by cities.

397
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,900
That's how we achieved victory.

398
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,620
Now, you have...

399
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,220
my word.

400
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,460
I won't trick you...

401
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,260
because you're a farmer.

402
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,700
Yes, he's not that kind of man.

403
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,260
It's true.

404
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,620
You can choose not to believe me.

405
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,060
The door's right there.

406
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,860
You may leave now...

407
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,980
and seek for another seller.

408
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,300
You came all the way to Beijing.

409
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,900
It's fate that we met.

410
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,260
This meal...

411
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,300
is on us.

412
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,740
But please give it a thought.

413
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,620
Once you leave here,

414
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,740
there's no way you'll be turning back.

415
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,020
It'll be too late for you to feel regret.

416
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,900
You have only one chance.

417
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,180
On the other hand, if you trust me,

418
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,140
let's go meet my friend then.

419
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,060
Brother,

420
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,220
we're being so sincere here.

421
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,700
You still don't trust us?

422
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,300
Fine.

423
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,700
Here's some mutton for you.

424
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,420
I don't trust you.

425
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,500
But I trust you, Boss.

426
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,060
Let's go now.

427
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,380
Wait.

428
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,900
Brother, this meal is on me.

429
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,460
No, I...

430
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,780
I paid for it, Old Hu.

431
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,300
What's happening?

432
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,780
There's nothing left.

433
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,420
Brother Six, get me a ladle.

434
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,860
I'll make myself full by drinking the soup.

435
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,220
Mr. Jin!

436
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,060
Are you home?

437
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,860
Sorry to keep you waiting.

438
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,260
I seldom see both of you.

439
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,060
Why are you here?

440
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,140
Stop joking around.

441
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,500
We have a customer here.

442
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,780
Fatty, you're funny as usual.

443
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,020
What's up?

444
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,300
We need you to have a look at something.

445
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Really?

446
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,220
Show me what you've got.

447
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,700
Is...

448
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,420
he the expert you're talking about?

449
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,220
Yes.

450
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,060
He's an antiques expert.

451
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,300
Take it out now.

452
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,140
Stop hiding it. We don't have all day.

453
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,940
He needs to see it.

454
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,020
Mr. Hu.

455
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,300
How do we talk about it?

456
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,620
Just do it in the presence of its owner.

457
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,860
Who is that stupid pig?

458
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,940
You're the owner.

459
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,140
The shoe's yours.

460
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,260
So, you're its owner.

461
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,220
I'm a stupid pig?
(Stupid pig pronounces the same with the owner in mandarin)

462
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,140
Well...

463
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,860
You're really something, Mr. Hu.

464
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,060
You're getting good.

465
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
What do you mean?

466
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,500
This shoe is quite unique.

467
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,300
Judging from its design, it's probably
made during the Ming Dynasty.

468
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,060
Here, look at this peony embroidery.

469
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,980
Since the Tang Dynasty,

470
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,620
people has been seeing
peony as the symbol of nobility.

471
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,060
Even though commoners...

472
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,060
would have peonies
embroidered on their shoes,

473
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,300
they wouldn't use...

474
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,620
golden thread to do so.

475
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,060
Also, even though these are not...

476
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,860
some expensive beads,

477
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,620
it did enhance the overall artistic value.

478
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,660
Not bad.

479
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,780
This shoe's collectable.

480
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,860
If I were to suggest a price,

481
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,300
it'd be this much.

482
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,220
Twenty?

483
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,060
Two hundred.

484
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,740
Of course.

485
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,700
It's the price for one shoe.

486
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,500
A complete pair...

487
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,940
worth more.

488
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,300
I'll leave...

489
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,180
the rest to both of you.

490
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,380
Fatty.

491
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,460
Get the money.

492
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Where's the remaining amount?

493
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,300
It's...

494
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,300
That's all we have.

495
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,540
Get up.

496
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,500
What?

497
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,180
What are you doing?

498
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,700
What are you doing?

499
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,620
Brother Chun Lai.

500
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,860
I've said so.

501
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,980
I won't trick you because...

502
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,900
you're a farmer.

503
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,020
It's all of our money.

504
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,220
You heard that yourself.

505
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,660
This shoe worth 200 yuan.

506
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,700
We only have 180 yuan.

507
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,780
I know we're 20 yuan short.

508
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,620
I can't do anything
if you refuse to accept our offer.

509
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,660
Forget about the other 20 yuan.

510
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
That meal was on us.

511
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,420
We paid for the hotpot after all.

512
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,660
Both of you ate it all.

513
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,860
I only got to eat a piece of meat...

514
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,020
and drink a cup of beer.

515
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,780
But you did eat something.

516
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,300
You can either throw it up...

517
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,020
or pay for it.

518
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,940
Deal?

519
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,740
I...

520
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,620
I'm not selling this shoe anymore.

521
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,300
Don't get mad, Brother.

522
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,620
We're all adults.

523
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,620
We should be more mature.

524
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,620
Right?

525
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,860
To be honest,

526
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,660
one hundred and eighty is a big amount.

527
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,220
He's right.

528
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,300
We can't even earn that much...

529
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,700
in half of a year.

530
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,900
Boss.

531
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,940
Actually,

532
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,420
I have a box full of more valuable stuffs.

533
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,940
If all of three could...

534
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,900
follow me back to...

535
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,460
my hometown Gulan County...

536
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,860
and buy that box of stuffs,

537
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,860
I'd able to...

538
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,260
get married...

539
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,660
and give birth to a child.

540
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,620
Didn't you say that you had only this shoe?

541
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,860
I didn't finish...

542
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,700
what I said.

543
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,020
Ma Da Dan's coffin shop...

544
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,300
was struck by the lightning.

545
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,780
And it's burnt to the ground.

546
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,020
And the strangest thing is...

547
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,860
that box was perfect as ever.

548
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,020
Without anyone noticing it,

549
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,860
I carried that box back to my place.

550
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,700
I'm here...

551
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,860
to look for...

552
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,380
a good buyer...

553
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,260
who can follow me back to my place...

554
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,180
and buy all those things.

555
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Brother Chun Lai.

556
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Let's do this instead.

557
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,020
Leave us your address...

558
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,300
or contact.

559
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,540
Shanxi is far away from here.

560
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,020
We need to talk it over.

561
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,140
Whether we will go or not,

562
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,060
we'll tell you. Is that okay?
