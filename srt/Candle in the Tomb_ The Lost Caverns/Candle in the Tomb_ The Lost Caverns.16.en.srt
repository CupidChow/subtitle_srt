[Episode 16]

3
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,860
Gosh.

4
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,860
Hurry, open the door.

5
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,860
Old Jin, what are you doing?

6
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,860
Burn them up.

7
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,380
Run.

8
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,340
I burn you up.

9
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,140
Go, Old Jin.

10
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,780
Hurry.

11
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,180
Brother.

12
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,180
Brother

13
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,340
Come on. I'm doing this side.

14
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,980
I'll pull this way.

15
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,820
With 20 more persons, we still can't pull it.

16
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,700
I've tried it.

17
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,340
Four Brother, get out of the way.

18
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,060
I'll bomb you to death.

19
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,820
Here.

20
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,060
Why doesn't it explode?

21
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,340
Hurry.

22
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,420
Hurry.

23
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,540
Hurry.

24
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,820
No way. The door is too heavy.

25
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,020
Use a rope.

26
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,540
Fatty, catch the rope.

27
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,940
Got it.

28
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,540
Is it long enough?

29
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,140
Done.

30
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,420
Pull it, it is done.

31
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,980
Get out of the way.

32
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,820
Go.

33
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,940
Hurry up.

34
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,300
Hurry.

35
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,740
He is brave.

36
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,140
I have to help him.

37
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,500
Old Hu.

38
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,660
Third Brother.

39
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,580
Brother,

40
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,100
I want to kill this huge thing.

41
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,020
Third Brother.

42
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,820
Third Brother.

43
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,260
Hu Ba Yi.

44
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,580
Go to die.

45
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,540
Get down.

46
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,620
Third Brother.

47
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,420
Hu Ba Yi.

48
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,420
Old Hu.

49
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Mr. Hu.

50
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,260
Third Brother.

51
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,940
Third Brother.

52
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,300
They are fine.

53
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,500
Go.

54
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,060
Brother.

55
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,980
I have blasted this huge thing.

56
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,940
Big fool.

57
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,620
Go now.

58
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Third Brother.

59
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Brave man.

60
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,180
Don't go.

61
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,740
Stand back.

62
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,380
Give it to me, you can't blast it that way.

63
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,980
Only one bullet left.

64
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,860
You can't shoot it.

65
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,740
Only one bullet left.

66
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,620
It's coming. Coming.

67
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Run.

68
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,180
Old Hu, go.

69
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Brother.

70
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,140
Hurry.

71
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,380
Hurry up. Hurry up.

72
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,180
Go.

73
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,820
Hurry up. Go.

74
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,740
Go, Brother.

75
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Hurry, Mr. Hu.

76
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,940
Why did them stop?

77
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Why did them stop?

78
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,380
What's going on?

79
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,820
It is weird.

80
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,540
Old Hu...

81
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,060
Hurry, put Old Hu down here.

82
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,300
Hu, are you okay?

83
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,140
Old Hu.

84
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:46,940
Hu.

85
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
Are you okay?

86
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,140
Hu.

87
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,380
Old Hu.

88
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,380
Hu.

89
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,300
Hu.

90
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,420
Old Hu.

91
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,980
You faint this time is worth it.

92
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,420
Your relationship is different now.

93
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,140
You're calling Old Hu sweetly.

94
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Is there a problem if I call him "Hu"?

95
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,380
Not at all.

96
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
As long as you're happy, you can call me anything.

97
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,060
Are you okay?

98
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,180
Don't worry.

99
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,980
The body of revolution stands still.

100
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,860
Stop standing still.

101
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,860
Let's take a break.

102
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,060
Third brother.

103
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,820
I will avenge you for sure.

104
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,180
Da Dan,

105
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,860
The spider is dead, there's nothing left to avenge.

106
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,180
If I can leave here alive,

107
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,980
I will blast this place.

108
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,260
Brother,

109
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,620
let's not talk about blasting.

110
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,500
As long as we can leave this place alive,

111
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,860
we're considered lucky enough.

112
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,140
Hu.

113
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,620
If you can lead all of us to leave,

114
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,020
from now on,

115
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,660
I will follow your instructions.

116
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,580
You can leave for sure,

117
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
but whether to bring you along
or not is another story.

118
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,500
Someone like you...

119
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,740
should stay underground
for the rest of your life.

120
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,500
In that case,

121
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,500
I should have put you into death.

122
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,380
Put?

123
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,980
Last time, I didn't die with those two bombs with me.

124
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,260
Now, are you going to do it?

125
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,380
Hey,

126
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,980
we're already in this situation.

127
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,740
Both of you,

128
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,980
can you stop fighting?

129
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,260
Hey, everyone.

130
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,620
Here.

131
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,980
Why is there a spring here?

132
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,860
Spring?

133
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,500
This must be the Coffin Spring,

134
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,860
the heart of the Build-in Well.

135
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
This spring...

136
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,380
would never dry up.

137
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
In Feng Shui,

138
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,980
it means there are valuable items stored in it.

139
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
What about the coffin?

140
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,980
Coffin,

141
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,860
should be...

142
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,380
Where is it?

143
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Why did the water stop? What mechanism is this?

144
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,780
Gosh.

145
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,980
Fine. Fine.

146
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Be careful.

147
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,140
Give me the torch.

148
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,860
Stay back.

149
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,500
A Western Zhou tomb

150
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,260
with a Tang dynasty coffin.

151
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,980
From your previous analysis,

152
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,660
Li Chun Feng improved the Western Zhou tomb.

153
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,780
There should be...

154
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
two coffins, one from
Tang dynasty and the other from Western Zhou.

155
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,980
Why is there only one coffin?

156
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,740
Don't go down first.

157
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,740
Let's take a look around.

158
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,900
Be careful.

159
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,660
Light up torches.

160
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,500
In fact, I don't understand either.

161
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,460
Did we get the wrong tomb?

162
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,140
This isn't Li Chun Feng's tomb.

163
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,580
No.

164
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,780
This is a Tang dynasty coffin.

165
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,980
Old Hu.

166
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,140
I think we shouldn't overthink.

167
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,140
We can just head over and take a look.

168
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,100
Sure.

169
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,620
I go first,

170
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,660
follow me.

171
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,860
Don't touch anything.

172
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,500
Be careful.

173
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,460
Old Hu.

174
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,260
Chief Yang.

175
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Look up there.

176
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,100
There are words.

177
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,500
I'll take a look.

178
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Be careful.

179
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,340
They are symbols on the Book of Dragon Bones.

180
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I am sure.

181
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,140
Fatty.

182
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,380
Come here.

183
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,620
Open the coffin, right?

184
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,940
I'll light up a candle.

185
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,020
Which side is south?

186
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,660
Which is north?

187
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,780
I can't even locate the south.

188
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,820
How would I locate the north?

189
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,420
If you can't,

190
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,340
don't mention to open the coffin
and light up the candle.

191
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,060
Give me the pen.

192
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,220
What pen?

193
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,940
That pen.

194
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,860
I have put back the pen...

195
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,860
in Li Chun Feng's hand...

196
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,220
in front of Chief Yang.

197
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,700
Right, Chief Yang?

198
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,700
I saw him put it back.

199
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,420
She did see that.

200
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,060
No, I don't have it.

201
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,420
Hurry.

202
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,140
This is the last time.

203
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,140
What?

204
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,220
Trust you.

205
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,300
What you did...

206
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,780
It has nothing to do with you.

207
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,620
I am redundant here.

208
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,460
This is Xiaozhuan.

209
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,100
What is Xiaozhuan?

210
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,220
It is also known as Qin Script.

211
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,020
After uniting the six countries,

212
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,420
Qin Shi Huang introduced it as a standard.

213
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,020
What is written on it?

214
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,860
This passage is from the Historical Records.

215
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,660
When the Count of the West...

216
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
was imprisoned in Youli,

217
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,860
he constructed the 64 hexagrams
from the Eight Trigrams.

218
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,380
When he died,

219
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,940
he was buried in Bi.

220
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,940
What does it mean?

221
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,900
It means,

222
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,380
someone called the Count of the West...

223
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,620
was imprisoned in Youli...

224
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,340
and constructed the 64 hexagrams.

225
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,700
After he died,

226
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,020
he was buried in a place known as Bi.

227
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,860
After Li Chun Feng verified it,

228
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
he created and improved
the Count of the West's tomb.

229
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,180
However, half of it is in front.

230
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,940
The rest...

231
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,340
should be at the back.

232
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,540
What are you looking at?

233
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,220
There's nothing here.

234
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,700
Will it stop? A mechanism again.

235
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,380
What?

236
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
I...I can't put it back.

237
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,820
Fatty.

238
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,220
I...

239
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,860
Be careful.

240
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,060
Be careful.

241
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,380
Again. These are all mechanisms.

242
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,580
DO you think these objects are indeed...

243
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,580
Old Hu.

244
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,460
Why did a chessboard appear?

245
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,620
This is a good thing.

246
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,820
Good thing?

247
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,340
We're locked inside, how is this good?

248
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,100
We come here voluntarily.

249
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,620
See that?

250
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,620
There's just one chess piece there.

251
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,540
That means we have one chance to take a step.

252
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,620
Looks like the owner of this tomb
didn't want us to die immediately.

253
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,020
He wanted to challenge us.

254
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,660
Let's accept it.

255
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,700
Does anyone know
how to play Five in a Row? Play it.

256
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,140
Fatty,

257
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,580
do you know the numbers?

258
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,540
Look,

259
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,340
there are many pieces here.

260
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,780
This isn't Five in a Row,

261
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,020
this is Go.

262
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,060
Then, does anyone know how to play Go?

263
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,860
Next.

264
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,580
Aren't we going now?

265
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Can you be more serious?

266
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,540
This advanced chess...

267
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,420
should be played by educated people.

268
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,700
Chief Yang.

269
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,380
You can do well, right?

270
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,180
I am a Class B international chess player.

271
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,620
But I don't know about Go.

272
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,820
No one can do it?

273
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,540
I'll do it then.

274
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,420
I don't mind.

275
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,420
The worst thing is to die, right?

276
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,060
I'll take the brunt.

277
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,420
This is just like Aeroplane Chess.

278
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,220
I think there's a big difference.

279
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,460
Not small.

280
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,420
Well...

281
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,220
Who discovered that this is Go?

282
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,380
Me.

283
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,060
Good.

284
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,620
Mr. Jin,

285
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,660
you should play it.

286
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,620
No. When I was young,

287
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,660
my grandfather taught me a little.

288
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,820
I'm not that good...

289
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,620
Don't bother.

290
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,900
We may die whether you play it or not.

291
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,820
Just do it.

292
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,140
We...

293
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,900
barely survived from the spider cave.

294
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,580
If I make a wrong move,

295
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,940
I'll harm all of you.

296
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,580
Mr. Jin, stop thinking too much.

297
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,620
I promise,

298
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,660
even if you harm me,

299
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,380
when we were in hell,

300
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,700
I wouldn't blame you, okay?

301
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,620
I will.

302
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,540
Look.

303
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,100
Is the situation not bad enough?

304
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,020
Don't think anymore. Hurry up.

305
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,820
Well...

306
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,660
Well...

307
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,940
Well...

308
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,460
This is strange.

309
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,220
How strange.

310
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,140
Mr. Jin.

311
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,380
Stop that saying. What's wrong?

312
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,620
Strange what?

313
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,420
This stalemate...

314
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,380
may be amazing back then,

315
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,660
but after thousands of years of research,

316
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,540
there is a chess manual
that has cracked this stalemate.

317
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,540
As long as this black piece is put...

318
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,180
in this position

319
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,820
to capture these white pieces.

320
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,220
Then,

321
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,100
black would win.

322
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,820
After all that fuss,

323
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,580
it isn't that hard.

324
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,100
Looks like social progress is a good thing.

325
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,060
This isn't right.

326
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,300
Miss Yang, what is your opinion?

327
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,820
I'm not doubting your judgment.

328
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,820
I think that this...

329
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
is too simple.

330
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,780
Simple?

331
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,380
Have you heard about...

332
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,620
the story of Jia Xuan and Emperor Taizong of Song?

333
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,580
Why are you telling a story now?

334
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,580
Jia Xuan...

335
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,620
was a Go prodigy in the Northern Song dynasty.

336
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,580
His job was to play Go with the emperor.

337
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,860
He was very skilled,

338
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,140
but because he worked for the emperor,

339
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540
when he played with the emperor,

340
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,860
he must lose once.

341
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Hence, the emperor was delighted...

342
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,860
and rewarded him sometimes.

343
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,540
I understand.

344
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,340
That means for this game,

345
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,820
we can win,

346
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,340
but we have to lose.

347
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,860
After some time,

348
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,060
the emperor discovered Jia Xuan's tricks,

349
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,620
so he ordered Jia Xuan to show his real skills...

350
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,180
or he would punish Jia Xuan.

351
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,820
Jia Xuan had no choice,

352
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,660
so he set...

353
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,100
a triple knockout draw.

354
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,620
Draw?

355
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,460
No matter what,

356
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,020
even if the tomb's owner isn't Li Chun Feng,

357
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,140
it must be our senior.

358
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,540
If we win,

359
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,820
it isn't suitable at all.

360
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,580
But if we lose,

361
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,100
it'll seem too easy.

362
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,300
It's not the solution.

363
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,540
Could it be that...

364
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,140
the tomb's owner wanted us to end the game in a draw?

365
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,700
Mr. Jin.

366
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,860
Can you make it a draw?

367
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,820
Actually, the triple knockout...

368
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,380
that Miss Yang mentioned,

369
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,060
is in this stalemate.

370
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,940
If this black piece...

371
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,660
is put

372
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
in this position

373
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,980
to this white piece,

374
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,140
then a rare...

375
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,860
quadruple knockout will be formed.

376
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,140
If that's the case,

377
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,140
it will be a draw.

378
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,420
Mr. Jin, since you can explain it clearly,

379
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,940
hurry up and play the game.

380
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,940
Hu,

381
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,700
you're the only one I trust.

382
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,060
Mr. Hu.

383
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,780
Mr. Jin.

384
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,380
Do it.

385
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,140
