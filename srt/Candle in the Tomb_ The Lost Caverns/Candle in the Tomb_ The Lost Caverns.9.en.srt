[Candle in the Tomb: The Lost Caverns]

2
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,980
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,980
Mr. Thomas.

4
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,980
What...

5
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
What does this mean?

6
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,180
Slide there with this.

7
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,180
Slide there with this?

8
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,660
And...

9
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,260
what if it breaks?

10
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Don't worry.

11
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,020
This cow leather...

12
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,340
is very firm.

13
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,700
We have no other way.

14
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,660
Nothing is forever.

15
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,340
Just don't look down.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,780
Close your eyes, extend your legs,

17
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,220
then you'll be there.

18
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,460
Here.

19
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
Hold it tight.

20
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,420
Hold with both hands.

21
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
No way.

22
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,780
I told you not to look down.

23
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,140
Here.

24
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,060
When I count to three,

25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,380
jump.

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,500
One.

27
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,580
Two.

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,780
Three.

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,860
No, this is too high.

30
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,580
Why don't you do it first?

31
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
If I go first,

32
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,940
you'll be more scared when you're alone.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,300
Or else,

34
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,220
you can run back.

35
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,460
I'll do this.

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,700
Hold it tight.

37
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,580
One.

38
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,540
Two.

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,820
Three.

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,060
Let me say something.

41
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,220
I remember I have always been afraid of height.

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,380
When I was three,

43
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,940
I...

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,660
Master.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,580
This Big Buddha...

46
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,100
isn't the same as what we normally see.

47
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,980
Tangut tribe is the majority in Xixia.

48
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,620
Tangut people originated from Tibet.

49
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,860
They helped Emperor Tang to reclaim lands,

50
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
and gained credits.

51
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,100
They were given land and the surname Li.

52
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,100
They believed in Tibetan Buddhism.

53
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,460
They were influenced more by India than China.

54
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,220
The Buddha statues are wearing
Chinese costumes.

55
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,340
But the figure is more similar to...

56
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,660
the origin of Buddhism.

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,180
So they don't look the same.

58
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,380
May the Buddha preserve us.

59
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,140
May the Buddha preserve us.

60
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,420
May the Buddha preserve us.

61
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,740
May the Buddha preserve us.

62
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,700
Mr. Thomas.

63
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,100
What are you doing?

64
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,820
As long as I can go back safely,

65
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,260
I'll pray to any god.

66
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,660
If you want to pray, pray in the middle.

67
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,900
May the Buddha preserve us.

68
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,540
May the Buddha preserve us.

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,900
May the Buddha preserve us.

70
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,540
May the Buddha preserve us.

71
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,020
This is...

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,500
What kind of trap is this?

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,460
And what kind of trap is that?

74
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,300
I thought you're useless here,

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,300
but turns out it isn't so bad.

76
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,420
See, I'm useful.

77
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,300
Mr. Thomas.

78
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,300
There are surely...

79
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,260
many treasures in the mysterious hall.

80
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,980
It means there will be more powerful traps.

81
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,500
You have to be careful.

82
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,620
If there's an emergency,

83
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,580
even we can't protect you.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,620
Okay.

85
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,180
Don't worry.

86
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,420
What is he holding?

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,180
It's a phosphorescence torch.

88
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,980
There's powder that...

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,540
made from the skeletons of the dead in there.

90
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,380
So the light is blue...

91
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,700
and it isn't hot.

92
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,740
Skeletons of the dead?

93
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,900
My Buddha.

94
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,180
Forgive this sinner.

95
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,820
Master.

96
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,620
There's a vertical well.

97
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,500
Got it.

98
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,860
Was that a Chinese ghost?

99
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,380
It seems we're at the entrance of the tomb.

100
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,580
How do you know?

101
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,300
There's a door.

102
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,100
Are you sure you want to go first?

103
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,700
If the entrance is easy,

104
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,020
the passage will be fatal.

105
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,940
This tomb isn't so superficial.

106
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,180
I'll have a look at it first.

107
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Oh, my god.

108
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,300
Mr. Gunner, you're so great.

109
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,500
You're so...

110
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,060
Bump!

111
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,780
You have to teach me in the future.

112
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,020
Besides,

113
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,060
I want this umbrella.

114
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,420
Mr. Thomas.

115
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,580
This Vajra Umbrella is the precious
of the Mountain Mover.

116
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,860
We have no extra for you.

117
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,860
Isn't this the ghost just now?

118
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,900
That's not a ghost.

119
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,780
This is the general of Qin, Weng Zhong.

120
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,260
Legend says that even ghosts are afraid of him.

121
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,500
So there's always a picture of
Weng Zhong guarding the tomb entrance.

122
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,420
Just now it was just the oxidized paint.

123
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,020
That's amazing.

124
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,900
I have never seen such a door.

125
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,860
This door is so exquisite.

126
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,660
The burial chamber must be behind it.

127
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,900
The people of Xixia were weird.

128
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,900
Although they didn't use door nail,

129
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,900
they used jade plates.

130
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,140
But look at this structure,

131
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,660
it was still influenced by Chinese culture.

132
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,420
This looks like Xixia language.

133
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,660
Can you recognize it, master?

134
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,180
Back then, Xixia had...

135
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Yellow River in the east, Jade Door in the west,

136
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,740
Xiao Mountain in the south,
and a dessert in the north.

137
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,220
It was enemy to Dynasty Liao and Dynasty Song.

138
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,420
It was powerful.

139
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,860
Back then,

140
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I've handled some relics of Xixia.

141
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,100
So I know a little Xixia language.

142
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,860
The carving on the wall...

143
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,740
is the Chinese Buddhist canon.

144
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,060
It must be originated from Dynasty Song.

145
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,260
Scripture.

146
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,460
Is there any clue that can open the door?

147
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,020
What you dream of is right here.

148
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,420
You shouldn't be too anxious...

149
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,700
and lose control.

150
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,540
I'll remember your teaching, master.

151
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,180
These jade plates...

152
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,060
shall not be touched.

153
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,540
When the amateurs open...

154
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,100
the door by force,

155
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,100
the traps will surely be activated.

156
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,620
Those who thought they knew Feng Shui,

157
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,780
wanted to open the jade door with jade plates.

158
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm afraid they were dead as well.

159
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,780
This tomb of Xixia isn't big,

160
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,260
but it's exquisitely decorated.

161
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,620
Behind this jade door,

162
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,620
there must be poisonous gas
or some dreadful traps.

163
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,540
The safest way...

164
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,940
is to enter through under the passage.

165
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Under the passage?

166
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,180
Yes.

167
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,180
The canon on the wall...

168
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,460
has hinted where the traps are.

169
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,700
Merciful Buddha...

170
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,780
says that the dreadful sea is endless.
Turning back is the only way.

171
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,140
Turn back and have a look.

172
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,580
All the bricks of traps just now,

173
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,100
don't they have special meanings?

174
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,020
Be careful.

175
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,780
How can there be meteorite in...

176
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,660
the tomb of Xixia people?

177
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,260
Don't touch.

178
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,420
Xixia culture...

179
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,500
has its mysterious side.

180
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,340
I have never seen this before.

181
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,820
Don't touch it,

182
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,380
in case of more trouble.

183
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,060
Turns out Marco Polo's adventure...

184
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,180
was true.

185
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,900
The amazing eastern has gold everywhere.

186
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,220
So many treasures.

187
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,540
Can I take some?

188
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,460
What I mean is...

189
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,220
when I go out,

190
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,340
I can build a school.

191
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,220
So all the poor children...

192
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,420
can have food and go to school.

193
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,300
These are the treasures of China.

194
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,140
They can't be exported.

195
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
Before I became a monk,

196
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,460
I had some properties.

197
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,420
If you really want to do good,

198
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,700
I can help you.

199
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,620
As I expected.

200
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,300
There are dead people in this cave.

201
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,580
The Feng Shui arrangement is broken.

202
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,660
This is a misery cave.

203
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,780
All the magical weapons

204
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,980
are useless down here.

205
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,420
Mojins have passed it down for generations,

206
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,140
saying that in such condition,

207
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,660
the tomb shouldn't be entered.

208
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,980
Furthermore, this black Buddha isn't normal.

209
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,100
Dust Bead.

210
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,860
Don't touch.

211
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,780
This is made from rotten jade.

212
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,780
It'll turn into pus when you touch it.

213
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,260
The Eternal Fire on the left is lower now.

214
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,340
I've finally found you.

215
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,780
Hold on.

216
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,140
Thank you.

217
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,020
Thank you.

218
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,660
Thank you.

219
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,820
You can't continue.

220
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,700
Turn back.

221
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,740
My tribe has been looking for Dust Bead
for thousands of years.

222
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,820
Many of us died.

223
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,700
It's right in front now, how can I turn back?

224
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,460
Please leave with this westerner first, master.

225
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,300
Light a candle at the Southeast corner.

226
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,900
Don't break the rules.

227
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,220
Yes.

228
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,740
Gu Zhe Shao...

229
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,660
thought the search of thousands of years...

230
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,620
has finally come to an end.

231
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,780
However, he only saw

232
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,940
a tortoise shell carved with foreign languages.

233
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
He was in despair.

234
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,700
He vomited blood...

235
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,580
on the tortoise shell.

236
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,420
What did you vomit?

237
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,260
Why is it golden?

238
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm fine.

239
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,660
Don't be too stubborn.

240
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,380
You have tried your best.

241
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,140
The symbol of Dust Bead appears
many times on the shell.

242
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,940
It must be relevant to Dust Bead.

243
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,220
Take this first.

244
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,620
When we're out,

245
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,540
we'll find someone who knows
the language to translate it.

246
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,060
We can surely find the Dust Bead.

247
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,980
Thank you, master.

248
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,300
Actually, I've got used to it.

249
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,780
I thought this is the last time.

250
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,420
Turns out it was the temperature
of fire that attracted the shadow.

251
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,620
When one enters with a torch,

252
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,260
he will surely die.

253
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,980
Xixia people were really cruel.

254
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Now that the fire is out,

255
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,700
what are they looking for?

256
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,180
Human.

257
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,020
Run, master.

258
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,620
Go.

259
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,660
What's the use of firing?

260
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Turns out guns are hot.

261
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,300
Run.

262
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,860
Run.

263
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,700
My leg.

264
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,420
Run.

265
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,180
Run.

266
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,860
Master.

267
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,740
Ignore me. Just run.

268
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,060
Go up.

269
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,100
What about you?

270
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,460
