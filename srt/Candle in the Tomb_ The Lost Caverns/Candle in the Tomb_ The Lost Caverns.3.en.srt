[Episode 3]

3
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,600
Go to the cabin now!

4
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,280
Okay!

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,120
Brother,

6
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
don't just stay there waiting for death!

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Do something! We can't let the boat sink!

8
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,880
You need to save your son!

9
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,560
That's right!

10
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,800
Tell me,

11
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,200
do you have any useful tools here?

12
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,800
Yes!

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
They're in the cabin!

14
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,560
Fatty!

15
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
There are steel pipes behind!

16
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,440
Okay!

17
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,560
Please save us, God!

18
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,240
Fatty!

19
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Install the pipes!

20
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,840
Okay!

21
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,560
Fatty,

22
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm counting on you two to save me!

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
It's killing us!

24
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,640
Old Hu!

25
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,600
Fatty!

26
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,880
Fatty!

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,520
Help!

28
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,760
Mr. Hu, be careful!

29
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm here!

30
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
Old Hu, come up now!

31
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
Give me the harpoon!

32
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
There you go!

33
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,240
Fatty, get me the another one!

34
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,440
There you go!

35
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
Old Hu, are you alright?

36
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Dad.

37
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,000
My son.

38
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Don't be afraid.

39
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
It's over.

40
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
Why did you tie yourself up?

41
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Of course, I did,

42
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,400
otherwise, I would have fallen into the sea.

43
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,240
Let me untie you.

44
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,880
I wouldn't come with you if I knew this earlier.

45
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,360
Old Hu!

46
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,600
Hu Ba Yi!

47
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,680
Old Hu!

48
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
Why are you yelling at me?

49
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,160
Can't you let me...

50
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,440
take a nap?

51
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,280
You're scaring me.

52
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
I thought you're dead.

53
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,280
Nonsense.

54
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,360
Come on. Move aside.

55
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
It's so tight.

56
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,120
The God of Rive has shown himself.

57
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,400
That happened right after we reached here.

58
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
I wouldn't come with you if I knew this earlier.

59
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,680
I shouldn't have come here.

60
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,160
I've never experienced that before.

61
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
It's all because of that shoe of yours.

62
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
My...

63
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
My little baby.

64
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,600
Thank you, bosses!

65
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,800
Thank you, bosses!

66
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,240
Thank you so much.

67
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
How's your son?

68
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,000
My son, he's fine.

69
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,280
If it hadn't been for both of you,

70
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,240
my son and I would be dead by now.

71
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
I'll give you a free boat ride.

72
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,520
I won't accept your money.

73
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,600
I get it.

74
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,440
Go take care of your child.

75
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank you, bosses!

76
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
The weather is unpredictable.

77
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,600
Old Hu,

78
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,440
I'm telling you,

79
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,240
When I was in the water,

80
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,790
I was feeling so scared.

81
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,320
I thought...

82
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,840
I'd die here.

83
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,790
I could have been killed...

84
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,680
by that gigantic fish.

85
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
Look at yourself.

86
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,440
You don't sound like
a courageous worker at all.

87
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,360
Shame on you.

88
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,760
No, I'm courageous.

89
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
If it hadn't been for me,
you would be dead by now.

90
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,720
Right?

91
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
Both of us...

92
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
joined hands to deal with that fish.

93
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
Don't you forget that.

94
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm having a headache with dizziness.

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm feeling so unwell.

96
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,600
Hey,

97
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,280
you've become heavier...

98
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,320
from being in the water.

99
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm dizzy.

100
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,920
Mr. Jin!

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
I need your help here.

102
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,120
You Fatty.

103
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,720
I'm so tired.

104
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,320
We've crossed the Yellow River.

105
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,480
Gulan County is over there.

106
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,720
Shanxi is behind there.

107
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm taking you all to the guest house...

108
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
for hot bath.

109
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
You can't fall sick. Let's go now.

110
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
Excuse me.

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,920
Careful.

112
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,320
We're here.

113
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,240
This is the best guest house in our county.

114
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,840
It provides anything you want.

115
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,800
Very convenient.

116
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
A room for three.

117
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,120
I'll pay you in one shot.

118
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,120
Old Hu,

119
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,440
it's unlucky.

120
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
that's a bad beginning.

121
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,920
Take a hot bath to get rid of our bad luck.

122
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Old Hu,

123
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,480
you can't live without me.

124
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm the one who help you all along.

125
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay.

126
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,280
Both of you are masters.

127
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,080
Awesome!

128
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,280
Please rest well.

129
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,720
I'll bring the stuffs here tomorrow morning.

130
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,360
Sure.

131
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,600
Encore!

132
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,600
What an excellent singing!

133
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,840
Their singing is so bad.

134
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,920
I sing better than them.

135
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,840
For thousands of years, the rash curse
has been bothering my people.

136
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,280
My people were desperate...

137
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,480
and suffered a lot.

138
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,840
Like our ancestors, my people
were killed eventually.

139
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,400
There're not many people left.

140
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,720
Things are getting so bad.

141
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,840
I went to the Mount of Vase...

142
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
with my juniors Old White Man and Hua Ling.

143
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,000
I knew Dust Bead's at
the Black Water City of Western Xia.

144
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
But I felt sorry for my late juniors.

145
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,280
Uncle Chen,

146
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,600
what's the matter?

147
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,840
It's so itchy.

148
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

149
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,360
Here.

150
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,320
I don't know what's wrong with me.

151
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,360
It's so itchy.

152
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,160
What a shabby place.

153
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't even take a hot bath.

154
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,720
Be grateful.

155
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,160
It's just a small county.

156
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
This isn't home.

157
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,160
That's right, Fatty.

158
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,200
Just clean our body with some hot water.

159
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,240
That's fine.

160
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,280
Yeah,

161
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,440
we're lucky enough to survive that boat ride.

162
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
You're right.

163
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,520
We never thought
Dragon King of Iron Head was there.

164
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,840
That's why...

165
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
we can't blame the locals
for being superstitious.

166
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,480
Anyone would...

167
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
worship a big fish like that.

168
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
That's a superstition.

169
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,680
No god would eat humans.

170
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,200
They should stop worshiping that stupid fish.

171
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,200
Fatty,

172
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
don't say so.

173
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,720
Mr. Hu's Tomb Calming Skill...

174
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,400
is based on...

175
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
the "feudal superstition".

176
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,040
Am I right?

177
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,560
Mr. Hu,

178
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,040
I've been meaning to ask you something.

179
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
In the...

180
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,840
history of China,

181
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,560
from Qin Shi Huang to Puyi, there're...

182
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
hundreds of emperors.

183
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
Feng shui talks a lot about dragon-like terrains.

184
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,520
How many pieces of dragon-like terrains...

185
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,840
did they use to bury these emperors?

186
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,440
Probably a battalion.

187
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
Here's the thing.

188
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,720
Actually,

189
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
dragon-like terrains do exist.

190
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,680
But there're many arguments.

191
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,440
In terms of feng shui, dragon terrain...

192
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,560
has two important elements,
shape and position.

193
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,120
Shape is about the topography of...

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,720
where the tomb is.

195
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,640
State is...

196
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,520
the conditions of that topography.

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
It's mentioned in Finding Dragons that...

198
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,400
dragons do exist,

199
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,680
but they don't show themselves.

200
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,240
A dragon gives birth to nine babies.

201
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
In terms of temperament, talent, and look,

202
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
they're not the same.

203
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,800
Same goes with dragon-like terrain.

204
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,840
And it's complicated than dragon
giving birth to babies.

205
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
In that case, it has scientific evidence.

206
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Shape and state. I don't understand any of them.

207
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,680
But I know...

208
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,240
there are emperors who died young.

209
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
I don't buy...

210
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,720
the idea of dragon-like terrain.

211
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
You're right.

212
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,440
It's an unreliable concept.

213
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,040
The shape and state of

214
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,520
a dragon-like terrain...

215
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
make sense in the Taoist philosophy of world,

216
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,080
but not in our society.

217
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,400
Feng shui doesn't...

218
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,800
determine history.

219
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,080
An earthquake, flood...

220
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
or changes in a stream

221
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,240
may alter...

222
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,320
the original shape and state of a land.

223
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,920
An earthquake...

224
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,720
could turn...

225
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,240
an auspicious cave into an inauspicious one.

226
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,400
We humans can't do anything about it.

227
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,600
That's why...

228
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,560
it is superstitious...

229
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,840
to build tombs as ancients did.

230
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,200
But we can...

231
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
find out a tomb...

232
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,440
using the theory of shape and state.

233
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,200
And that's a scientific method.

234
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,120
Mr. Jin, you heard it right.

235
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,400
It's science.

236
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,920
I can't argue with you...

237
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,400
because I'm a layman after all.

238
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,400
Right?

239
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,920
But do you know?

240
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,440
Li Chun Feng is tomb is in this Gulan county.

241
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,080
You're nothing...

242
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,240
compared with him.

243
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
Mr. Jin.

244
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
Li Chun Feng is tomb is in this county?

245
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,320
Who's that?

246
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,800
Li Chun Feng was a feng shui master
during the early Tang era.

247
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,440
And he was from Gulan County.

248
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,920
His body was buried here.

249
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,680
Everyone knows about it.

250
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,200
The early Tang era?

251
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,440
That makes it a Tang tomb?

252
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,560
Yes.

253
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,680
Surely there are many valuables...

254
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,560
in his tomb, right?

255
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Stop talking nonsense.

256
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,440
Clean yourself and go to bed.

257
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,280
Yeah.

258
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,440
I was just joking.

259
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,720
Fatty,

260
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,320
why is there a red mark...

261
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,560
on your shoulder?

262
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,320
Really?

263
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Old Hu, take a look at it.

264
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,320
Wait a second.

265
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,240
You have one too.

266
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,400
Are they the same?

267
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,120
Yes.

268
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
I think...

269
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
we're bitten by that fish.

270
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,320
Nonsense.

271
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
It could have...

272
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
eaten you alive.

273
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,680
Okay, it's nothing.

274
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,800
Once we go back home,

275
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,920
I'll hire a master to scrub my body.

276
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,240
And it'll be gone instantly.

277
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,640
As clear as candlelight,
as accurate as turtle-shell divination.

278
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,720
Everything is complete.

279
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,640
Chen Tuan reincarnated...

280
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,720
as King Wen of Zhou.

281
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,840
Old man,

282
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,320
that's a confusing poem...

283
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,280
for your entrance.

284
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,120
Wait.

285
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Why are you here?

286
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,440
You're scaring me.

287
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,310
I don't want you all to die here.

288
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
That's why...

289
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm giving you a clue.

290
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm blind.

291
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,320
But I know the principles of Taoism.

292
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
Since you all...

293
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,800
survive the disaster,

294
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,280
why don't you ask for my advice?

295
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
How did he know that?

296
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
I know right.

297
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,400
He probably heard what we said.

298
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,680
Old man,

299
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,360
aren't you a fortune teller?

300
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

301
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,000
It's late, you should go home now.

302
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Guys,

303
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
what's buried in the earth
are good stuffs indeed.

304
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,200
But you must handle with care.

305
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,880
Western Paradise is where
the dead people want to go.

306
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,640
They just want to rest in peace...

307
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,000
without being disturbed by outsiders.

308
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,640
Among you all,

309
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,360
there are two persons with strong yin energy.

310
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,120
I'm afraid...

311
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,240
something bad is going to happen.

312
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Wait.

313
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Who are you talking about?

314
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,880
Both of you?

315
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
You're talking to him.

316
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,120
Feeling curious?

317
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,160
Just follow me.

318
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
Old man,

319
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,520
you have a nice stall.

320
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,640
Old man,

321
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,400
what's your name?

322
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,600
I'm a fortune teller.

323
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,400
And I'm blind.

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,680
You can call me Blind Chen.

325
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,160
Why are you still here?

326
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,240
Why didn't they catch you

327
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,080
by then?

328
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,680
Tell us.

329
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,720
Why is something bad going to happen to us?

330
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Tell us now,

331
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,000
otherwise I'll break...

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,880
your stall.

333
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,640
What are you talking about?

334
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,560
You're such a vulgar man.

335
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,440
You have no wisdom at all.

336
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
You're not worth my time.

337
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
But...

338
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm willing to talk to this man.

339
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
Wait, what do you mean?

340
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
Does he look down on me?

341
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,360
He doesn't want to talk to you...

342
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
because you said you wanted to break his stall.

343
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I didn't...

344
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,360
What are you doing?

345
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,200
What are you doing?

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
Wait. What are you doing?

347
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,720
Let me touch it.

348
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Touch what?

349
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,200
Your bone.

350
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,920
No, wait a second.

351
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,120
It's okay.

352
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,280
The inherited hexagram.

353
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,200
An exquisite face.

354
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
A bamboo tube full of secrets.

355
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,920
Things foretold using a few copper coins.

356
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,080
No, please don't...

357
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,080
Just touch one's bone.

358
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,840
And you'll know who he is.

359
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,040
What's the use of touching your bone?

360
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,520
Stop it.

361
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,840
So, what did you find out?

362
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,080
Old man,

363
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,800
can you stop hoaxing us?

364
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,360
Here's my advice.

365
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,400
One mustn't be superstitious.

366
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,120
The Party shall lead one to the right path.

367
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,920
Get it?

368
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,880
It's strange.

369
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,080
It's truly strange.

370
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,360
You look like...

371
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,680
the young version of me.

372
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,160
What do you mean?

373
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,880
Did you just take advantage of me?

374
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,920
No, I didn't.

375
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,120
That's a compliment.

376
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,560
Where a snakeman closes one's eyes...

377
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
is where a state ruler is.

378
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,000
It seems that you're a famous imperial official.

379
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
A state ruler?

380
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,200
In our society,

381
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,320
its equivalent is a state commander.

382
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,800
It can be a governor...

383
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,680
or military commander.

384
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,000
Old man,

385
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
do I look like a governor
or military commander?

386
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
We got you now.

387
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,080
You're such a bad liar.

388
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,560
You should have said that...

389
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,400
his son would be a state ruler.

390
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,600
That's a perfect lie.

391
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
Old man. Old man.

392
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,920
You keep calling me an old man.

393
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,640
People will laugh at you...

394
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,120
for disrespecting an elder like me.

395
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,080
Then, I'll call you...

396
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,720
Forget it.

397
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,360
Old man.

398
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,400
The hexagram and feng shui secrets
contained in Yi Jing.

399
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,440
They're all profound and diverse.

400
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,840
And they have their own functions.

401
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,880
You shouldn't use it to trick people for money.

402
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,880
That would be an insult to
the wisdom of our ancestors.

403
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Am I right?

404
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
You're right.

405
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,840
The hexagram of Yi Jing
is profound indeed.

406
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,080
And there're many
unknowing secrets of feng shui.

407
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,320
Except for Mojin Xiaowei...

408
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
who know Finding Dragons,

409
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,680
nobody else knows how profound it is.

410
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,640
And how dare you laugh at me.

411
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,000
Old man,

412
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
you're right.

413
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We're...

414
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,680
Old man,

415
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,120
you said something bad...

416
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,560
was going to happen to us.

417
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,480
Fine.

418
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
You'll fortune-tell me.

419
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Let's see what it could be.

420
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,760
Yang for the word and yin for the back.

421
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
Good job, Mr. Hu.

422
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,560
He didn't get one of them.

423
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,000
It'd be better if he got it too.

424
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,800
Right?

425
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,040
The sky prevails.

426
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,200
It's a Possession hexagram.

427
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,360
Old man,

428
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,400
it's a fine hexagram.

429
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
You get it, old man?

430
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,920
It's a Possession hexagram,

431
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,600
not a disastrous one.

432
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,160
You seem to know...

433
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,720
a thing or two about hexagram.

434
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,040
But it's such a pity.

435
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,080
You don't know...

436
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
everything about it.

437
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
Then tell me.

438
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,640
What's this hexagram about?

439
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,560
Look carefully.

440
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,920
Where are all these copper coins facing?

441
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,680
Northeast.

442
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,360
He determined the direction by hearing?

443
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,280
And please check.

444
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,800
What time is it?

445
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
8:30 p.m.

446
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Does all this have to do with time?

447
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,640
It's 8:30 p.m. That's it.

448
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,000
The date is Guihai and the time is Renxu
according to the Chinese calendar.

449
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
A death door is located
at the Northeast direction.

450
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,280
A burning sky with a death door...

451
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,160
I'm afraid...

452
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,000
you'll have to die from being arrogant.

453
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,840
Mr. Hu,

454
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,160
why is there a death door?

455
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,120
A death door?

456
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,880
Where is it?

457
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,280
Which is the death door?

458
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,400
Rest, life, harm, delusion,

459
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,320
scenery, death, fear, and open.

460
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,800
The death door is one of
the eight doors in Qimen Dunjia.

461
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,400
I was once told that...

462
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,280
a master fortune-teller...

463
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,080
would always determine
the position of eight doors.

464
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
I never thought this old man would know that.

465
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,920
That means...

466
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,880
he's a master?

467
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,360
In that case,

468
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll save you all.

469
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,840
Here's a hexagram for you.

470
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Have you heard of...

471
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,880
Gentle hexagram?

472
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
One for yin, two for yang,

473
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,600
three for yang, four for yin,

474
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
five for yang, six for yang.

475
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,280
And that's...

476
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,880
a Gentle hexagram.

477
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,480
Is he really blind?

478
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Gentle is the wind.

479
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,640
It also means obedience.

480
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,880
But here's the problem.

481
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,360
Between the host and the guest,

482
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,200
who shall be the obedient one?

483
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
Old man,

484
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,120
I'm impressed by you.

485
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Old man,

486
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
it's late. Do rest well.

487
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,600
We're leaving now.

488
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
See you.

489
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,400
It's...

490
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,640
fate that we met.

491
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,920
No matter what, you told a fortune for us.

492
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,440
I was trying to find out if he's really blind.

493
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,200
That's none of your business.

494
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,920
A lonely boat by the beach.

495
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,440
There's a barge pole but no water.
So, nothing can be done.

496
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
The occasional rain and wind
make the river rise.

497
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,680
Now, one can move freely.
