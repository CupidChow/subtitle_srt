00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,980
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,580
Old Jin!

4
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,060
Old Jin!

5
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,460
Old Jin!

6
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,300
What is Old Jin doing?

7
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,580
Why did he run?

8
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,300
He should have waited for us to rescue him.

9
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,020
It's so dark, how can we find him?

10
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,820
Old Jin!

11
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,500
Old Jin!

12
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,980
Old Jin!

13
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,140
Slowly.

14
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,980
Old Hu,

15
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,700
I think someone is staring at me.

16
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,500
Nonsense.

17
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,780
Something hit me.

18
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Don't talk nonsense.

19
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,860
It does.

20
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,780
What is this?

21
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,460
Faeces.

22
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,340
Whose faeces is this?

23
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Theirs.

24
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh, no.

25
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,740
There are so many bats.

26
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,780
Old Hu.

27
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,060
Look.

28
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,660
It's so narrow.

29
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,020
Can we pass it?

30
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
What should we do?

31
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,180
Old Jin's shoe prints show that he headed inside.

32
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,740
Close your mouth.

33
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,940
Bat faeces produce large amounts of ammonia.

34
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,780
If we inhale too much of it,

35
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,620
it can be fatal？

36
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,100
It can be super smelly.

37
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,060
Old Hu, wait a minute.

38
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,780
I think we should take another path.

39
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,180
Look, this cave is huge.

40
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,220
Its paths are all linked together.

41
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,500
We may be able to use another path to get there.

42
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,100
If we enter...

43
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,220
and the bats do something to us,

44
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,180
we won't be able to save Old Jin.

45
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,220
Where is the path?

46
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,100
Yes.

47
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,740
We came from this path.

48
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,060
Why is it gone?

49
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,980
Fatty,

50
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,540
look.

51
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,500
Am I seeing this correctly?

52
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,660
Or did I fall in a daze?

53
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,180
Is that thing moving?

54
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Where?

55
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,100
That...

56
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,500
Old Hu.

57
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,300
Is this the dirty thing
Old Man Wang was talking about?

58
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,980
What on earth is this place?

59
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,620
I think...

60
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,940
we should head back.

61
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,300
I'd rather the bats do something to me...

62
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,100
than that thing.

63
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,740
Let's pretend we didn't see anything.

64
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,500
Yes...

65
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,180
We didn't see anything.

66
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,860
Let's go.

67
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,420
I didn't see anything.

68
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,740
Didn't see anything...

69
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,300
It's all my imagination...

70
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,860
Actually, I didn't see anything.

71
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Didn't see anything.

72
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
I told you not to look at it!

73
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,940
Old Hu,

74
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,100
did you touch the faeces
with this hand...

75
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,300
and then use it to cover my mouth?

76
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,860
Yes.

77
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,740
Take off your bag.

78
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,360
I know.

79
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,100
What are you doing?

80
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,280
I...I really...

81
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,540
No, I really...

82
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,540
I didn't do it on purpose.

83
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,540
I couldn't control this.

84
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,300
This...

85
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,040
Run!

86
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,800
Quick!

87
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,280
Quick!

88
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,240
Hurry, Fatty!

89
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
Old Hu!

90
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,880
Hurry, Fatty!

91
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,600
Old Hu!

92
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,540
Are you sure Old Jin entered this bat cave?

93
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,260
I think so.

94
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,700
Can he escape alive?

95
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,580
Old Hu!

96
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,900
Hurry, climb in!

97
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,580
Okay.

98
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,940
Old Hu, I am stuck!

99
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,060
Why are you farting...

100
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,020
during this moment?

101
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,260
I can't control it.

102
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,300
Besides, I was bit at the butt!

103
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,700
Old Hu.

104
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,660
Was Old Jin harmed by the bats?

105
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,540
Get lost!

106
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,060
Hold it!

107
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,580
They are gone, right?

108
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,300
I think so.

109
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,140
They are gone.

110
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,940
Come out.

111
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,180
Well,

112
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
thank to this cauldron.

113
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,260
Or else, we would have been...

114
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,660
bitten to death by those bats.

115
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,300
But, thinking about it,

116
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,380
why is there a cauldron here?

117
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,420
Let me tell you.

118
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,260
This cauldron...

119
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,540
was use by the ancient people
to offer sacrifices...

120
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,660
or record important events,

121
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,660
get it?

122
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,700
From the inscriptions,

123
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,940
this is from early Western Zhou.

124
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,460
Western Zhou?

125
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,340
See this altar?

126
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,660
The cauldron must have been placed here.

127
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,660
For whom the sacrifice is?

128
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,740
That dirty thing.

129
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,940
How would I know that?

130
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,980
What do you think?

131
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,540
I think...

132
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,180
this is too big.

133
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,420
We may can't take it out.

134
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,100
Right.

135
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,420
If we take this out,

136
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,700
we can sell it and buy a few buildings.

137
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,740
Why don't we...

138
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,420
take out one leg?

139
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,460
Sure.

140
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,460
Go ahead.

141
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,000
The problem is, no useful tools are here.

142
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,940
Use your teeth if you don't have tools.

143
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,540
Where should I bite it?

144
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,660
What are you thinking about?

145
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,220
What are we doing here?

146
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,940
We are here to save Old Jin.

147
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,700
Why are you just thinking about money?

148
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,180
Moreover,

149
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,700
Old Jin should bite this with his teeth, not you.

150
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,100
Right, he has a gold tooth.

151
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,940
What are you doing?

152
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,860
Why are you still joking with me?

153
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,340
This time, don't you feel wronged this time?

154
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
We came to collect good stuff,

155
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,540
but we were lied to.

156
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,940
When we were escaping, Old Jin went missing.

157
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,580
If we don't take away...

158
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,700
this valuable ding,

159
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
let me tell you, Old Hu,

160
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,860
you can do whatever you want.

161
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,700
Even if I break it today,

162
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,940
I must break its leg.

163
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,860
Enough.

164
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,820
Let me ask you,

165
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,300
did you take Ma Da Dan's detonator with you?

166
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,580
Yes, it's in my bag.

167
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,340
By the way, Old Hu,

168
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,340
let's just use a dynamite to blow it up.

169
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,340
Are you that poor?

170
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,420
I mean, use the detonator to blast out a path.

171
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,820
Or else, how will we escape?

172
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Go ahead then.

173
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,340
Wait,

174
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,220
can you smell something fragrant?

175
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,740
It's a familiar scent.

176
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,460
Yes, there is a scent.

177
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,460
Was this cauldron used to stew meat?

178
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,340
No.

179
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,100
The scent isn't from this cauldron.

180
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,420
Old Hu...

181
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,820
The scent is coming from here.

182
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,460
Are you sure?

183
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,660
Yes, my nose is right.

184
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,820
It's underneath.

185
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,660
Smell it.

186
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,220
Yes, it is.

187
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,540
Come, let's head down.

188
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,940
Slowly.

189
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,860
Holy shit.

190
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,340
Holy shit!

191
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,580
Old Hu,

192
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,340
there's a skeleton here.

193
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,660
You like it?

194
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,100
You're the one who like it.

195
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,060
Don't you think the scent...

196
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,540
is from his body?

197
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,860
What?

198
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Old Hu, look. What is this?

199
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,300
Mojin.

200
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,060
This is a Mojin Talisman.

201
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Mojin Talisman?

202
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,060
Holy shit.

203
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,940
But, if this is Mojin Talisman,

204
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,740
then who is he?

205
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,020
Mojin Xiaowei.

206
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,060
Why is he here?

207
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
There's a tomb here.

208
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,340
Even if there's a tomb,

209
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,660
according to the inscription on the cauldron,

210
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,300
it should be a tomb from Western Zhou.

211
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,660
No, Old Hu.

212
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
If he was a Mojin Xiaowei.,

213
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,940
shouldn't he have some good stuff?

214
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,580
Look at the things he has.

215
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,060
They are all junk.

216
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,580
Did he die out of poverty?

217
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Look.

218
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,060
I've never seen any wound like these.

219
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Maybe the dirty thing did it to him.

220
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,060
Looks like he died ages ago.

221
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,340
Since he is our senior...

222
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,700
and we found him,

223
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,100
let's bury him.

224
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,900
Fine.

225
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,940
Well...

226
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,700
This Moji Talisman...

227
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,380
is your gift to me in return.

228
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,220
Thank you.

229
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,540
Old Hu.

230
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,020
Look, what is this?

231
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,380
The scent came from here.

232
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,220
It smells really good.

233
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,260
What is this?

234
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,300
Judging from its material,

235
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,940
this must be the legendary Fragrant Jade.

236
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,140
Fragrant Jade?

237
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,020
Golden Tooth said before that...

238
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,540
this is a secret jewel of the aristocrats.

239
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,220
It was discovered during
the Warring States Period.

240
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,700
It isn't that common among the people.

241
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,940
Moreover,

242
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,540
the drier the surroundings are,

243
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
the stronger the scent is.

244
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,500
There was a poem praising it.

245
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,260
The world has never heard of
flowers being able to speak,

246
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,380
then the Fragrant Jade was discovered.

247
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
God is creation is wonderful...

248
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,540
until no one is able to understand His greatness.

249
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,780
Then this must be very valuable then?

250
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,220
Not only it is valuable,

251
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,860
judging from its texture and workmanship,

252
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,860
this must be...

253
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
a Dragon-shaped jade from
the Warring States Period.

254
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,700
For unearthed and jades in the market,

255
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,940
there aren't many excellent pieces at this size.

256
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,700
This must be...

257
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,100
used by the noblest aristocrats...

258
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,780
to symbolise their status.

259
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,940
Okay...

260
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,860
Old Hu,

261
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,860
with this jade,

262
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,460
that means I don't have to
break off a leg from the cauldron, right?

263
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,900
Continue breaking the leg.

264
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,660
Am I a fool?

265
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,660
Help me.

266
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,660
Let's go.

267
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,100
It's mine then. Thank you.

268
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,620
Old Hu...

269
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,980
This Fragrant Jade,

270
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,260
can we keep it?

271
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,460
Take it.

272
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,460
Sure.

273
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,220
You finally got the hang of it.

274
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,700
We're finally reached a united front.

275
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,220
I didn't mean that.

276
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,380
Didn't you find...

277
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,540
anything different here?

278
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,100
This place smells good.

279
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,940
There is a skeleton down here.

280
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,940
There aren't any bat faeces here.

281
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,180
That means the bats don't like to come here.

282
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,220
I think...

283
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,860
this may be due to
the fragrance of the Fragrant Jade.

284
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,140
If that's the case,

285
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,180
we can go anywhere in this cave...

286
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,860
if we have this jade, right?

287
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,300
Ghost! Help!

288
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,220
Ghost!

289
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,740
Ghost!

290
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,460
Help!

291
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,460
Why does this person seem familiar?

292
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,220
Of course. He's Old Jin!

293
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,980
Mr. Jin!

294
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,500
We finally found you!

295
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,480
Don't go after me!

296
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,440
Old Jin, wait for us!

297
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,320
Don't go after me!

298
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,000
Old Jin!

299
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,240
Old Jin!

300
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Don't go after me!

301
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,000
Old Jin!

302
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Old Jin!

303
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,560
Old Jin!

304
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,940
Mr. Jin, I'm Old Hu!

305
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,220
I don't care who you are!

306
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,240
Old Jin!

307
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,320
Old Jin!

308
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,320
Old Jin!

309
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,480
Old Jin!

310
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,000
Old Hu!

311
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Old Jin!

312
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,620
Where is he?

313
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,860
Where is Old Jin?

314
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,180
He runs so fast!

315
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,300
Old Hu, let me tell you.

316
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
The bats aren't the only ones after us.

317
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,900
There must be many dirty things around.

318
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,740
Really?

319
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,500
We must find Old Jin then.

320
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,660
Yes. Where is he?

321
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,620
Old Jin!

322
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,980
Old Jin!

323
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,540
Help!

324
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,180
Mr. Jin!

325
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,700
Fatty, detonator!

326
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,940
Holy shit.

327
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,180
Old Hu,

328
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,620
they won't be able to come over,

329
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,380
but we won't be able to leave.

330
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,380
What do you mean?

331
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,620
It's a dead end.

332
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,900
Why is Mr. Jin stuck in the wall?

333
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,860
You don't say.

334
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,260
Old Jin,

335
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,660
it's quite hard to get in this position.

336
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,700
Hurry, take him out.

337
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,420
Okay.

338
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,980
Old Jin, slowly...

339
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,020
Come out, Old Jin.

340
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,380
Are you fine?

341
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,420
Old Jin.

342
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,260
Old Jin.

343
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,220
Are you fine, Old Jin?

344
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,100
Old Jin...

345
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,660
Ghost...

346
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,220
Old Jin.

347
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,500
It's me, Old Hu.

348
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,020
I don't care who you are!

349
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,420
I...

350
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,660
Mr. Hu!

351
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,460
What about me?

352
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,780
Holy shit.

353
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,500
Fatty!

354
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,060
Enough...

355
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,140
He's come to life. He is fine...

356
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,180
You finally recognized us.

357
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,980
Why did he faint again?

358
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,780
Is he frightened or hit by the bomb?

359
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,140
Isn't it obvious? His face.

360
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,580
Bitten by bats.

361
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,260
I touched him; he has a fever.

362
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,260
He should be infected with malaria.

363
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,660
Hurry, find some medicine for him.

364
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,660
Where would I get medicine here?

365
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,180
Haven't you heard of this saying?

366
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,220
For all the poison in this world,

367
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,020
there must be an antidote within five steps.

368
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,660
Fine.

369
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,340
One, two...

370
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,420
What are you doing?

371
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,060
I'm measuring the five steps
so I can find the antidote.

372
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,220
Are you a fool?

373
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,540
That's just a metaphor.

374
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,780
Isn't it everywhere on the ground?

375
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,500
Bat faeces.

376
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,900
"Ye Ming Sha", a Chinese medicine.

377
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,780
It's a folk remedy for malaria.

378
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,820
Come, open his mouth.

379
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,140
Open your mouth, Old Jin.

380
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
He swallowed one.

381
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,260
By the way,

382
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,700
your butt was bitten by the bats.

383
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,740
For your weight,

384
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,980
you should eat two of it.

385
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,140
No need, Old Hu.

386
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,580
It didn't bite through my butt.

387
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,500
Take a look if you don't believe me.

388
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,300
This medicine is effective.

389
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,820
It works right after he ate it.

390
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,940
Well,

391
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
the only one who can fix the problem
is the one who created it.

392
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,500
Guys,

393
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,300
what is wrong with me?

394
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,660
You've been infected with malaria.

395
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,180
We just fed you with one...

396
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,540
It's good that you've recovered.

397
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,780
Mr. Jin, how do you feel now?

398
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,260
There's something sticky in my mouth.

399
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,020
Tastes good.

400
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,180
You have a strange taste.

401
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,340
By the way,

402
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,820
the both of you were chasing after me?

403
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,220
In the beginning, the bats chased...

404
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,500
and bit you.

405
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,260
Later on, we chased you.

406
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,980
But, Old Jin,

407
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,980
you're a coward.

408
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,020
The bats scared you this much?

409
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,460
What bats?

410
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,940
Let me tell you, Fatty.

411
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,020
I...

412
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,420
That thing must have done something to me...

413
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,700
What did I say?

414
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,020
That thing did something to him.

415
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,340
What did something to him?

416
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,500
A female ghost.

417
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,940
What do you mean?

418
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,740
It must be a female ghost.

419
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Her hair was extremely long.

420
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,420
She wrapped her hair around my neck.

421
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,500
I tugged at the hair...

422
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,980
and escaped.

423
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,580
Or else, I'd...

424
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,300
Don't talk nonsense.

425
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,900
There isn't any ghost.

426
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,180
We are materialists.

427
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,140
Can't you stand this hardship?

428
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,940
Yes...

429
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,980
What nonsense are you talking about?
What female ghost?

430
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,420
Let me pass...

431
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,720
Why are you shouting? Just let me pass.

432
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,440
You're too much.

433
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,020
But, Old Hu,

434
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,740
having said that,

435
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,140
when we were here,

436
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,260
I felt that something was staring at me.

437
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,580
Moreover, didn't you see that moving face?

438
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,820
And,

439
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,740
when we were running, didn't you realize that...

440
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,420
besides the bats behind us,

441
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,900
there was another...

442
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,820
thing chasing us?

443
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
I think,

444
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,140
it must be the female...

445
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,300
Yes!

446
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,820
Destroy all ghosts.

447
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,180
Break the old things and build the new ones.

448
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,980
Stop talking about the female ghost.

449
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,980
There isn't any ghost.

450
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,340
Old Hu,

451
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,740
we should settle the problem now.

452
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
How should we get out?

453
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
We blasted our way out
using the detonator just now.

454
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,060
This time, we blasted ourselves in.

455
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
How will we get out?

456
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,260
You don't say.

457
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,700
Old Jin ran aimlessly...

458
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,220
and found us a way out.

459
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,980
Holy shit.

460
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
See this?

461
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,220
There are hoe marks everywhere.

462
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,260
Yes.

463
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,300
This hole is round, like it was drawn by a compass.

464
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,700
It's too round.

465
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,740
I think...

466
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,900
that...

467
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,500
Our senior dug this hole.
