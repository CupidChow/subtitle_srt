[Episode 7]

3
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,780
See this?

4
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,820
There are hoe marks everywhere.

5
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,780
Yes.

6
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,940
This hole is round like it was drawn by a compass.

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,300
It's too round.

8
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,500
I think...

9
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,660
that...

10
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,300
Senior Mojin dug this hole.

11
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,660
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,340
Let me tell you.

13
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,380
When we came down,

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,420
we saw the corpse of a Mojin Xiaowei.

15
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,980
It proves that Old Hu was right,

16
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,660
there's a huge tomb
underneath Fish-skeleton Temple.

17
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,980
It's a Western Zhou tomb...

18
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,540
as we found a bronze cauldron from Western Zhou.

19
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,260
Did I miss so many things?

20
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,180
It's fine.

21
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,580
I can bring you back to have a look.

22
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,340
No.

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,300
No, I won't go.

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,380
Don't scare him.

25
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,580
If he runs again,

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,740
we won't be able to catch up.

27
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,940
Let's go in and take a look.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Let's go, Old Jin. Stand up.

29
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,660
Stand up. Let me help you.

30
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,220
Old Hu.

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,740
Come on.

32
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,900
This immortal saved us.

33
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,460
Thank you for your blessing.

34
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,820
Thank you for your blessing.

35
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,940
Thank you for your blessing.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,100
Thank you.

37
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,300
Guys,

38
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,740
look.

39
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,100
Are these beams...

40
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,460
built with fish bones?

41
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,980
Yes, indeed.

42
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,940
Isn't this Fish-skeleton Temple?

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,660
Looks like you've got it right.

44
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,260
This Fish-skeleton Temple...

45
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,340
is the entrance of the tomb.

46
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,260
It's all thanks to
that Mojin Xiaowei.

47
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,980
I will ask around...

48
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,420
who this senior is.

49
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,580
I need to take a break.

50
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,660
Fatty,

51
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,420
are you scratching against the tree like a bear?

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,140
No, I can't reach it.

53
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,980
Come and scratch for me.

54
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,780
Sure.

55
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,100
Here?

56
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,660
Move to this side.

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,940
What happened to your back?

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,380
Why is there swelling?

59
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,340
Swelling?

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,140
Why don't you take off your clothes?

61
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,660
There's something.

62
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,140
Turn around.

63
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,380
Fatty,

64
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,220
well,

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,980
the rash that you had...

66
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,180
changed.

67
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,980
Changed to what?

68
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,260
It changed to...

69
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,060
an eyeball.

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,540
Eyeball?

71
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,060
What's wrong?

72
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,980
Old Hu.

73
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,140
Did your rash change?

74
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,060
Mine?

75
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,140
Hurry, take a look!

76
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,220
Don't be anxious.

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,340
Be gentle.

78
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,180
Let's take a look.

79
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,660
Did you see it?

80
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,380
It changed!

81
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,660
There is an eye here.

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,540
Just like yours.

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,260
Just like mine?

84
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,940
Yes...

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,100
Really?

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,260
Yes.

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,220
What does it look like? Let me see.

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,340
Like this.

89
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,700
Li hexagram.

90
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,260
Li hexagram?

91
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,140
What is that?

92
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,420
Do you remember the talisman Blind Chen gave us?

93
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,660
Yes.

94
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
We didn't manage to find out...

95
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,380
what the last one means.

96
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Isn't it a Li hexagram?

97
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,100
No...

98
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,580
Aren't we talking about the eye?

99
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,980
Why mentioned Li hexagram here?

100
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,940
Yes.

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,140
The hexagram...

102
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,900
corresponds to natural phenomena...

103
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,460
and also human organs.

104
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,140
Li hexagram corresponds to the human eye.

105
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,380
Old Hu, you mean...

106
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,020
when that blind man gave us the talisman,

107
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,220
he knew...

108
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,140
the eye would appear on our backs?

109
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,900
This is amazing.

110
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,460
I admit he's an expert.

111
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,700
But he isn't that good.

112
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,860
Did he hear us talking about the rash...

113
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,860
when we were at the water house?

114
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,140
I don't think so. We...

115
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,460
didn't talk about eyes.

116
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,540
Yes.

117
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,340
Why did he know about the rash?

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,900
No,

119
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,900
that old man is odd.

120
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,340
If he had any purposes...

121
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,460
or wanted to know anything,

122
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,220
why didn't he ask us?

123
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,660
Now to think about it,

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,460
the second hexagram
that refers to the southwest...

125
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,900
might not refer to the ferry.

126
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,700
It must be Fish-skeleton Temple.

127
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,340
Why is he so familiar with...

128
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,460
this Mojin Xiaowei?

129
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,140
There must be something going on.

130
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,100
You're right.

131
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,500
No way. I have to go back to him.

132
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,340
I have to ask about this.

133
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,940
Mr. Hu,

134
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,220
don't do that.

135
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,340
Ma Da Dan and his bunch of ruffians...

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,020
won't let us go easily.

137
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,100
Where Blind Chen is staying now...

138
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,140
is inside the hostel.

139
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,300
If Ma Da Dan left an informer there...

140
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,340
to wait for us,

141
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
we'll be caught if we head there.

142
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,140
I think...

143
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,980
we should leave this place immediately.

144
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,700
This may be just a common skin disease.

145
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,780
Let's go to 301 Hospital...

146
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,780
and take some medicine. We may recover easily.

147
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,500
No, Mr. Jin.

148
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,900
It's easier said than done.

149
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,460
This thing isn't on your back.

150
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,100
Let me tell you,

151
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,980
whenever I think...

152
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,460
about this thing on my back,

153
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,020
I feel uncomfortable.

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,780
That's right.

155
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,100
I don't want to escape
without knowing anything...

156
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,780
with something strange on my back.

157
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,980
How about this?

158
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,220
Fatty, bring Golden Tooth back to Beijing.

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,420
I will go to Blind Chen.

160
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,300
I won't go back.

161
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
I have to be with you.

162
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,140
Then, what if...

163
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,380
Well, no...

164
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,740
Old Jin,

165
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
don't you want to go back to Beijing?

166
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,980
You can go back yourself.

167
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,820
Mr. Jin.

168
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,900
You don't have any rash on your back.

169
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,260
This doesn't concern you.

170
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,700
We're being straightforward.

171
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,580
It's reasonable for you to withdraw now.

172
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,380
Fatty and I understand.

173
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,540
Yes.

174
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,900
I know you well.

175
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,260
You're flabby,

176
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,660
afraid and weak, right?

177
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,660
If I'm weak, I'm a fool.

178
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm just...

179
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,220
worried about our safety.

180
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,460
Since we're here,

181
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,260
fine.

182
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,100
I will accompany...

183
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,020
the both of you until the end.

184
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,220
Mr. Jin,

185
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,140
you don't look like a man.

186
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,780
However,

187
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,900
you're a...

188
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,100
Let me finish talking.

189
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,820
Now, we should...

190
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,140
go to Old Man Wang's house...

191
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,140
to eat and replenish our energy.

192
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,780
During midnight,

193
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,900
we will head to that hostel.

194
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,140
You mean...

195
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,220
enter the village quietly.

196
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,580
Don't alert others.

197
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,300
Are you a ghost?

198
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,620
Hang on.

199
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,660
We're here...

200
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,140
Sir.

201
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,060
Sir.

202
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,220
Sir!

203
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,260
Sir!

204
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,140
Sir.

205
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,700
Young men.

206
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,180
You're here again.

207
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,980
Why are you in this state?

208
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,260
You're thirsty again?

209
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,580
You're hungry again?

210
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,900
You're tired again?

211
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,020
We're ill.

212
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,540
Sir,

213
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,700
please give us a room...

214
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,140
to rest, is that okay?

215
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,460
It's not that I don't want to let you in.

216
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,740
That professor that I told you about...

217
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,380
is here from Beijing.

218
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,900
He stays at my house every time.

219
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,900
He has a strange temper,

220
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,700
he doesn't want to meet outsiders.

221
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,100
This time,

222
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,780
he brought along a female assistant.

223
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,780
It's even more inconvenient.

224
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,900
Sir, we're in this state.

225
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,020
Let us in to drink some water...

226
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,460
and get changed.

227
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,020
Yes.

228
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,020
It's just a woman.

229
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,220
We don't think it's inconvenient.

230
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,260
It's fine. I mean it.

231
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,340
It's not that I don't agree, I can't do that.

232
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,140
Hu Ba Yi.

233
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,140
American Girl.

234
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,180
I went to Beijing to look for you.

235
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,180
But we met here instead.

236
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,020
Why are you here?

237
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,300
It's a long story.

238
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,620
This is...

239
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,620
This is Professor Sun.

240
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,100
An expert from National
Cultural Heritage Administration.

241
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,820
This is Hu Ba Yi.

242
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,220
This is Wang Kai Xuan.

243
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,340
They are members of...

244
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,020
the Ancient City of Jingjue team
of Professor Chen and me.

245
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
This is Boss Jin.

246
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,740
Mr. Jin.

247
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,860
Just call me Golden Tooth.

248
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,580
Why are you here?

249
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,060
Do you have...

250
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,100
an eyeball rash on you?

251
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,100
How do you know that?

252
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,580
Do you have it too?

253
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,420
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,500
I dragged everyone into this mess.

255
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,020
What do you mean?

256
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,340
The rash on us...

257
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,460
is a virus.

258
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,540
Have you ever heard of
the Moving Mountain Sect?

259
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,180
Mojin Xiaowei...

260
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,700
Tomb Raiding Sect,

261
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Moving Mountain Sect and
Unloading Mountain Sect...

262
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,340
are the legendary four sects, right?

263
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,820
It's just a representation.

264
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,700
There is another origin about
the Moving Mountain Sect.

265
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,300
For thousands of years,

266
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,980
they think they originated from this rash...

267
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,620
and died from this rash.

268
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,420
Die?

269
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,700
Many years ago,

270
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,340
on Mount Zagrama near the Western Regions,

271
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,900
there was a tribe.

272
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,700
They were known as the Zagrama Tribe.

273
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,980
They migrated from Europe...

274
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,700
and lived here aloof from world affairs...

275
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,620
until someone found...

276
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,300
a deep Ghost Cave by chance.

277
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Their tribe's prophet

278
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,100
led them to worship the cave...

279
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,060
and tried to find out the secret of the Ghost Cave.

280
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,780
But it brought to them a terrible curse.

281
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,780
A rash that looked like an eye...

282
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,540
appeared on everyone

283
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,500
that was cursed.

284
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,540
It would stay there forever.

285
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,140
People who had the rash...

286
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,700
would die before they were 50 years old.

287
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,260
Although they didn't die immediately,

288
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,740
right before they died,

289
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,140
their blood would gradually turn yellow,

290
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,300
experience difficulty in breathing...

291
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,740
and suffer.

292
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,980
The prophet divined that...

293
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,620
the Central Plains World has...

294
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,140
a holy bead that is the same as the rash.

295
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,740
If the holy bead is found, they can break the curse...

296
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,460
and save their tribe.

297
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,540
Hence,

298
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,740
the Zagrama tribe...

299
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,100
migrated inland...

300
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,180
and was gradually assimilated by the Chinese.

301
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,260
At last,

302
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,580
deduced from many clues,

303
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,100
they confirmed that this bead...

304
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,060
is the legendary...

305
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,340
Dust Bead.

306
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,380
Then,

307
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,940
the descendants of the Zagrama tribe...

308
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,220
started their journey...

309
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,300
to find the Dust Bead.

310
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,620
They think that the Dust Bead do exist,

311
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,580
but was buried in an ancient tomb...

312
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,940
together with the corpse.

313
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
To break free from the rash,

314
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,580
they had to separate...

315
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,340
and search for the Dust Bead in different tombs.

316
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,220
This Moving Mountain Sect...

317
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,460
is good at the Five Elements.

318
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,820
They called themselves as Taoists.

319
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,220
They only want medicine...

320
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,940
and aren't greedy for wealth.

321
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,940
Unexpectedly, they have their difficulties.

322
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,820
By the way, Miss Yang.

323
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,700
you made me confused.

324
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,660
I didn't understand one thing.

325
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,420
This is a rash curse...

326
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,060
or is it a virus?

327
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,220
They called it a curse...

328
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,140
because people in the past...

329
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,980
had limited scientific knowledge.

330
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
They often misinterpret
unexplained phenomena...

331
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,260
as Xuanxue.

332
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,820
After our research,

333
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,340
we confirmed that...

334
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,980
it is a disease caused by a virus.

335
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,500
To make it simple,

336
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,100
the virus disrupted the absorption of iron...

337
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,540
by red cell hemoglobin,

338
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,060
causing IDN symptoms.

339
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,940
Blood will gradually turn yellow...

340
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,100
and breathing ability will decrease.

341
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,220
At last,

342
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,820
the patient will die
due to multiple organ failure.

343
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,820
Why are you surprised?

344
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,700
It has nothing to do with you.

345
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,100
The imperialists will never abandon
its intention, right?

346
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,820
No.

347
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,220
You knew we would be infected with the rash...

348
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,500
once we go there.

349
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,340
Why did you involve Old Hu and me?

350
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,980
What are you thinking?

351
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,420
It's a pity that Old Hu...

352
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,460
Fatty. Fatty

353
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,580
Calm down, will you?

354
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
It has already happened, what else can we do?

355
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
We should treat the illness by finding a cure.

356
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,780
It's no use worrying.

357
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,820
Listen to her carefully.

358
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,220
I listened carefully.

359
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,180
She pranked us!

360
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Can't you tell it?

361
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,340
Why are you still defending her?

362
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,700
She wants you to die!

363
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,580
She didn't mean that, okay?

364
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,180
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,540
It was my bad.

366
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,340
If I knew you would infect with the rash

367
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,620
after the trip to the Ancient City of Jingjue.

368
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,340
I wouldn't involve you.

369
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,180
Fine. I got it.

370
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,940
So,

371
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,620
I'm trying my best...

372
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,420
to make it up.

373
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,460
Make up for what?

374
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,420
Can you make up for my life?

375
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,940
American Girl, just wait and see.

376
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,100
Without a satisfactory answer,

377
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,580
if I let you return to U.S.,

378
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,340
I will...

379
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,220
Fatty.

380
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,860
Don't go too far.

381
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,020
Can you treat our international friend nicely?

382
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,700
Let her finish talking. Hurry, sit down.

383
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,140
Sit down.

384
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,540
Yes, drink some water.

385
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,900
This time, I came back to China...

386
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,860
to find the Dust Bead.

387
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,140
I hope to solve the problem for everyone.

388
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,060
What?

389
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,380
You know where the Dust Bead is?

390
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,580
The Dust Bead...

391
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,580
isn't that easy to find.

392
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,300
It's one of...

393
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,660
the legendary three great beads
of Central Plains.

394
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,340
After the Shang Dynasty,

395
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,780
it went missing.

396
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,060
For you, Miss Yang...

397
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,220
came from afar and
tried all means to see me...

398
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,660
so I would help her to find the Dust Bead.

399
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,180
According to historical records,

400
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,620
the 32nd King of the Shang Dynasty, Wang Wu Ding...

401
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,100
found a giant eye-shaped jade...

402
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,340
in a collapsed mountain.

403
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,940
Wu Ding believed that...

404
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,460
this jade was mother earth in phoenix form,

405
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,180
representing the immortal
Eye of Reincarnation.

406
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,460
He named it as the Dust Bead,

407
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,020
commonly known as the Phoenix Gall.

408
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,980
After the fall of Shang Dynasty,

409
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,540
the Dust Bead went missing.

410
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,700
It is said that...

411
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,780
King Wen of Zhou recorded its whereabouts...

412
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,060
on a turtle plastron.

413
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,380
But, this...

414
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,060
plastron, known as the Book of Dragon Bones...

415
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,860
is also missing now.

416
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,060
You talked about useless stuff...

417
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,340
to tell us that...

418
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,860
we can't find the bead now?

419
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,940
Miss Yang,

420
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,660
since you're here,

421
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,580
you must have found other clues.

422
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,820
Pardon me,

423
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,860
but we're in this state,

424
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,060
you should reveal...

425
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,820
why you are familiar with
the Moving Mountain Sect.

426
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,700
Yes.

427
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,940
How do you know about that Za...

428
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,420
Zagrama.

429
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,540
About the Zagrama tribe?

430
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,180
I am a descendant of the Zagrama tribe.

431
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,100
My grandfather,

432
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,660
known as Zhe Gu Shao,

433
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,780
is the last Moving Mountain disciple.

434
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,180
My grandfather left this for me,

435
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,980
the last clue about the Dust Bead.

436
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
If you want to know...

437
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,940
more about my grandfather,

438
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,100
it's all in this notebook.

439
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,820
The rash curse has been troubling
our tribe for a few thousand years.

440
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,660
Our tribe is in despair...

441
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,060
and tried our best until the day we die.

442
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,180
But we still suffer from
the same destiny as our ancestors.

443
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,980
Now,

444
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,420
our tribe is dying.

445
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,340
I brought my juniors, Old White Man and Hua Ling...

446
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,820
and entered Mount of Vase.

447
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,540
We learnt that Dust Bead is at
Black Water City of ancient Western Xia.

448
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,500
My pity juniors died in a foreign land.

449
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,540
My heart aches for them.

450
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,020
I'm Zhe Gu Shao

451
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,140
from Moving Mountain Sect.

452
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,020
You're the leader of Moving Mountain Sect.

453
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,380
I heard that...

454
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,780
you're the first disciple of
Zhang San Ye from Mojin Xiaowei.

455
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,020
I hope you can teach me your skills.

456
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,780
I have been living in seclusion for many years.

457
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,860
I'm no longer related to my previous life.

458
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,700
Moreover,

459
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,740
I heard that the Moving Mountain
tomb raiders...

460
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,900
only wants the elixir of immortality...

461
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,700
and aren't interested in gold and jade items.

462
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,020
To be honest,

463
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,260
the elixir of immortality is just a rumor.

464
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,260
The Moving Mountain Sect wants...

465
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,780
the Dust Bead.

466
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,460
The Moving Mountain disciples
are from the same tribe.

467
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,220
Our ancestors were cursed...

468
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,980
not to live past 50 years old.

469
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,700
Only the Dust Bead can break that curse.

470
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,140
But, your sect...

471
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,340
has your own skills.

472
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,740
Why do you want to learn our skills?

473
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,420
I found out that the Dust Bead...

474
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,980
is in a treasure cave in Western Xia.

475
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,660
This cave is well hidden.

476
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,460
We can't find it...

477
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,700
using our skills.

478
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,260
I heard Mojin Xiaowei...

479
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,660
is good at finding dragons and
determining good or ill luck.

480
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,020
I think...

481
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
with your skills,

482
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,500
I will be able to find the Dust Bead.

483
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,420
I promised...

484
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,220
to stop and not rob tombs anymore.

485
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,500
Once the artifacts reappear,

486
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,260
there will be great bloodshed.

487
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,700
But this concerns your tribe's trouble.

488
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,860
I can't stand aside and watch.

489
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,860
Fine.

490
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
I can teach you my skills.

491
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,700
But, according to the rules,

492
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,500
you must first sign a Pledge of Allegiance.

493
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,620
I will give you the Mojin Talisman.

494
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,700
Thank you for your kindness.

495
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,460
Ten miles northwest from here,

496
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,860
there's a wordless half stone.

497
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,700
Underneath it...

498
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,220
is a Southern Song tomb.

499
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,580
That tomb...

500
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,060
is not in a right direction,

501
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,700
fierce,

502
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,620
shaped like a broken sword
and an overturned boat.

503
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,740
It's a vicious tomb.

504
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,100
Zombies are easily spawned there.

505
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,220
Remember the rules of Mojin Xiaowei.

506
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,020
When the rooster crows, stop robbing.

507
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700
When the light goes off, stop robbing.

508
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,500
After the rooster crows,

509
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,180
it's not good to continue robbing the grave.

510
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,540
We are most afraid of seeing...

511
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,700
cats, foxes and weasels in tombs...

512
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,500
as it's easy for corpses to turn to zombies.

513
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,620
Even if it happens,

514
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,500
I must bring back the burial clothes.

515
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,260
That was how I got into the tomb
and retrieved the burial clothes.

516
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,180
Not bad.

517
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,260
Be straightforward.

518
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,180
However,

519
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,020
I got the burial clothes when the
rooster crowed and the light went out.

520
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,260
I couldn't differentiate
which came first...

521
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,500
and which came later.

522
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,660
I couldn't decide...

523
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,340
if this was against the rules.

524
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Due to your sect's rules,

525
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,220
I won't make it difficult for you.

526
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,260
If I managed to survive in the future,

527
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,500
I will come and listen to your teachings.

528
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,580
Wait.

529
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,300
If you don't learn my skills,

530
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,940
how will you find the Dust Bead?

531
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,180
Faith will...

532
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,620
move mountains.

533
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,820
I will think of another way.

534
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,500
Since you came here for my help,

535
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,260
it must be fated.

536
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,460
It is my fate.

537
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,420
You mean...

538
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,740
you're willing to teach me?

539
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,740
You don't care that I might have broken the rules?

540
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,660
First,

541
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,020
saving those who suffer brings joy,

542
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,500
it is the teaching of Buddha.

543
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,740
Since I know about the sufferings of your tribe,

544
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,780
I can't stand aside and watch.

545
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,260
Second,

546
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,260
you didn't hide the fact that...

547
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,260
you only managed to get the burial clothes...

548
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,140
when the rooster crowed and
the light went off at the same time.

549
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,740
You're skilled...

550
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,300
and honest.

551
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,780
You're commendable.

552
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,740
Thank you for not giving up on me.

553
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,100
I am lucky to be your disciple.

554
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,500
Dear Master,

555
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,100
please accept my bows.

556
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,620
Zhe Gu Shao,

557
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,420
let me ask you.

558
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,300
What is the most important...

559
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,380
for a Mojin Xiaowei?

560
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,060
I am foolish,

561
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,220
please enlighten me.

562
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,300
Benevolence,

563
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,220
provide joy to all beings.

564
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,060
Compassion, remove sorrows from all beings.

565
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,820
Being a Mojin is sinful.

566
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,060
We can't have bad vices.

567
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,460
Since I am your teacher,

568
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,100
I should teach you to do good deeds.

569
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,460
I know...

570
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,820
that you're an expert.

571
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,580
However, if you don't have benevolence...

572
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,620
and only make cruel decisions,

573
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm afraid...

574
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,260
you can control your own life...

575
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,020
but not your fate.

576
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,300
Do you understand?

577
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,340
Yes.

578
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,980
I will spare lives...

579
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,060
without acting rashly.

580
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,700
Not only humans.

581
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,100
Although a wild cat is an animal,

582
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,500
it is a living being.

583
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,020
You shouldn't kick it to death in the tomb.

584
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,260
From now on, whenever you do anything,

585
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,740
you should spare your opponent's life.

586
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,100
Yes.

587
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,220
Come with me...

588
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,140
and burn the burial clothes of
the Southern Song female corpse.

589
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,380
Let's read the Rebirth Mantra...

590
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,060
so the zombie and wild cat...

591
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,780
will find bliss.

592
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,340
Tomorrow,

593
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,020
we will...

594
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,540
begin our journey to find the Dust Bead.

595
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,700
