[Episode 14]

3
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,070
As a cock crows and the candle
dimes out, stop robbing.

4
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
We're not welcome here.

5
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,240
Leave now.

6
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,030
Quick.

7
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,920
Open the coffin.

8
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,040
Fifth brother.

9
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,760
Hurry up and leave.

10
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,760
Hurry.

11
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,590
Li Chun Lai, go.

12
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,790
Hurry.

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,510
Be quick.

14
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,790
Hurry up and leave.

15
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,680
Old Jin.

16
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,350
Hurry.

17
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,120
Hurry up.

18
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,310
Hurry up.

19
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,070
Come here.

20
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,000
Brother.

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,710
Fatty.

22
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,760
Old Jin.

23
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,400
Go.

24
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,560
Old Hu.

25
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,840
Go up, Mr. Jin. Hurry up.

26
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,630
Old Hu.

27
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,560
Old Hu, what is this?

28
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,360
This is mercury.

29
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,240
Cover your mouth and nose.

30
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,750
Okay.

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,590
Elder brother, up there.

32
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,680
Old Hu, what should we do?

33
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,800
Do you think I was God...

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,800
always having a solution?

35
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,910
Hurry.

36
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,520
Hurry. Go. Go.

37
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,630
It's my fault for being clumsy.

38
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,030
Old Jin, it's pointless to say that。

39
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,710
Didn't we say we should live and die together?

40
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,000
It's too late to live together,

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,280
but we're going to die together.

42
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,560
This is too fast.

43
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,630
Old Hu, look.

44
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,030
It's here too. Go.

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,430
Hurry. Go.

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,150
Go.

47
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,870
Go.

48
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,590
Go. Head in.

49
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,030
Come on.

50
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,470
Hurry.

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,590
Old Jin, hurry up.

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,150
Come on.

53
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,750
Go up the pillar.

54
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,430
Okay.

55
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,030
Oh, no.

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,750
What should we do?

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,470
What should we do?

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,000
We're doomed.

59
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,150
Old Jin.

60
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,960
Old Jin, are you okay?

61
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,310
Why are you acting like this?

62
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
What's wrong with him?

63
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,360
He might have inhaled
too much mercury and poisoned.

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,630
He's hallucinating.

65
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,000
Old Jin.

66
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Old Jin.

67
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,560
Old Jin, wake up. Old Jin.

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,120
-Old Jin.
-Old Jin.

69
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,360
Stop singing, Old Jin.

70
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
Old Hu.

71
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,560
I think I can't make it.

72
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
Shirley Yang...

73
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,310
Hold on.

74
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,360
Li Chun Feng was appointed
as imperial historian.

75
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,070
Old Hu,

76
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,390
this pen can be taken down.

77
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,830
I see.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
Old Hu.

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,070
What did you discover?

80
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,190
Mechanism.

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,950
The mechanism is the armillary sphere outside.

82
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,720
Crap.

83
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,750
We need to go out now.

84
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,830
Shirley Yang, are you okay?

85
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,070
The chives taste weird.

86
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,720
Brother.

87
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,270
Brother.

88
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,800
Hu Ba Yi, come out quickly.

89
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,430
Hurry up.

90
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,390
Fatty, jump with Old Jin.

91
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,920
Got it.

92
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
Old Jin. Jump.

93
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,560
Shirley Yang...

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,750
Hurry, jump.

95
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,240
-Do it quick.
-Quick.

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
Hurry, pull hard.

97
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,430
Hurry.

98
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Old Jin. Get up. Get up.

99
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,360
Hurry.

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,360
Hurry.

101
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Old Jin. Get up.

102
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,480
Hurry.

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,800
Be careful.

104
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Tui Bei Drawing is just a cover-up.

105
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,950
Li Chun Feng understood human's weakness.

106
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,040
He placed the mechanism...

107
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,630
in the most obvious place.

108
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,390
Hang in there, Old Jin.

109
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,270
Be good.

110
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,190
Hurry.

111
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,360
Old Hu.

112
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,630
There are words here.

113
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
This is the sexagenary cycle.

114
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,480
It should be a cryptosystem.

115
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,870
The password should be...

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,270
It should be a year.

117
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,430
The 7th year of Zhenguan.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,560
At that year,

119
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,390
Li Chun Feng invented a new armillary sphere.

120
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,480
No.

121
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,560
It should be the 22nd year of Zhenguan.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,510
During the 22nd year of Zhenguan,

123
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,750
Li Chun Feng was appointed
as imperial historian.

124
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,870
He was in his prime that year.

125
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,950
What's the sexagenary year of

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
the 22nd year of Zhenguan?

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,070
Sexagenary year? What year is it?

128
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,720
No, I don't know...

129
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
What year am I...?

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,830
No, what year is it now?

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,800
How would I know?

132
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,480
No, what year is it now?

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,830
This is so hard.

134
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,800
Where is Old Jin?

135
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,560
Old Jin.

136
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,560
Old Jin.

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,680
Old Jin.

138
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,430
Old Jin.

139
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,630
Old Jin.

140
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,120
Mr. Hu.

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Are you dead too?

142
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,430
Tell me,

143
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,630
The 22nd year of Zhenguan,

144
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,160
what's its sexagenary year?

145
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,120
Why am I being tested in hell?

146
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
If you won't answer,

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,390
we would die soon.

148
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,160
Old Jin.

149
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,160
Old Jin.

150
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,830
Old Jin, wake up.

151
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,480
Old Jin, wake up.

152
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,600
The first year of Zhenguan
that Li Shi Min ascended the throne

153
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,960
is 626 A.D.

154
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,550
The 22nd year of Zhenguan should be...

155
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,670
648 A.D.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,750
One cycle is 60 years.

157
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,320
Add 1320 years from the nearest.

158
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,960
It should be the year 1968.

159
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,080
My mother was 60 years old in 1969.

160
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,670
That year should be Earth-Rooster year.

161
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
So the year 1968 would be...

162
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,910
Earth Monkey.

163
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,720
Look for Earth-Monkey year.

164
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,630
Look for Earth-Monkey year.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
Look for Earth-Monkey year.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,120
Look for...

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
Earth-Monkey year.

168
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,000
Earth-Monkey year.

169
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,000
Old Hu, it's here.

170
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,030
Be careful.

171
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,380
[Earth]

172
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
This.

173
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,820
[Monkey]

174
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,550
Why is the floor moving?

175
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,870
Dizzy. I feel dizzy.

176
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
What is this thing?

177
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,910
Brother.

178
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
We're done for.

179
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,510
This time, we're done for.

180
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,440
Old Hu, why is it spinning?

181
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,030
The door isn't open.

182
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Were we wrong?

183
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,910
I must have missed something.

184
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,150
The New Tang History mentioned that...

185
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,440
Li Chun Feng's armillary sphere...

186
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,320
has three spherical layers and a base.

187
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Why does it have only two orbits?

188
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,030
It's not here.

189
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,550
Here.

190
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Be careful.

191
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,630
Brother.

192
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,030
It isn't spinning.

193
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,790
I see.

194
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,790
We did it.

195
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,390
We're safe.

196
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,240
We're safe.

197
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,000
Old Jin.

198
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,750
Old Jin.

199
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,240
Let's go.

200
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,840
What is this?

201
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,670
The 28 mansions.

202
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,670
The 28 mansions?

203
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,120
What does it mean?

204
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,870
We have to...

205
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,270
find the correct answer...

206
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,440
among 28 mansions.

207
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,870
Choose one out of 28?

208
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,750
How to choose one out of 28?

209
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,440
How can we do that?

210
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,870
If we don't choose, we'll all die.

211
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,790
I would be wrong
even if there were only two choices,

212
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,790
not to mention choosing one out of 28.

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,240
How should we choose?

214
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,960
That's right.

215
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,870
It's too hard.

216
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,840
Stop it.

217
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,510
Let him think.

218
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,200
Dipper,

219
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,630
the head of Xuanwu...

220
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,870
is formed by six stars.

221
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,550
It looks like...

222
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,200
It looks like the Big Dipper.

223
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,870
It is also known as Sagittarius.

224
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,030
Is this what Taoism means...

225
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,910
Sagittarius is destined to live,
Big Dipper is destined to die?

226
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Li Chun Feng was also a Taoist.

227
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,390
Old Hu,

228
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
go ahead.

229
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,750
I will follow you whether to live or die.

230
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,000
Die? I don't want to die.

231
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,360
Old Hu, look.

232
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,030
Go.

233
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,360
The door is open.

234
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,240
-Hurry up.
-Go.

235
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Fatty.

236
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,400
I finally come to myself now.

237
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,680
Me too.

238
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,960
Let me tell you,

239
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,550
when the door closed,

240
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
I wanted to kill myself.

241
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,550
When the door opened,

242
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
I wanted to praise myself.

243
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,960
Why?

244
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,920
Without me,

245
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,440
Mr. Jin...

246
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,790
What is this place?

247
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,110
Why is it so dark here?

248
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,400
Yes.

249
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Look at both sides.

250
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,200
Wait, let me see whether it's deep or not.

251
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,270
Don't.

252
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,960
You might not reach the bottom.

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,830
Come on. Walk in the middle.

254
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,240
Old Hu.

255
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,920
This is...?

256
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,920
Be alert.

257
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,240
There should a bottomless abyss on both sides.

258
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,070
Walk in the middle.

259
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,160
Moreover, there might also
be mechanisms in front.

260
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,350
What?

261
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,750
There are mechanisms?

262
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,160
How many mechanisms are here?

263
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,440
You can return and drink the mercury.

264
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,000
Be careful, everyone.

265
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,440
Walk in the middle.

266
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,030
It's fine.

267
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,960
Slowly.

268
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,750
Walk in the middle.

269
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,590
Old Hu,

270
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,790
why is it strange here?

271
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,680
The torchlight...

272
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,960
can only light up five or six steps ahead.

273
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,720
This may be an ancient...

274
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,830
light-absorbing coating.

275
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,000
We can't turn back.

276
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
We can only go on.

277
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,160
Stick with me.

278
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,270
Eldest brother,

279
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,110
the Mojin Xiaowei...

280
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,750
lives up to its reputation.

281
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,070
For our trip,

282
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,440
without Hu Ba Yi,

283
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,920
some of us might die here.

284
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,830
Yes...

285
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
Just now, the cave was spinning.

286
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,000
How did he stop that?

287
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,350
He's really capable.

288
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,160
That's right.

289
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,510
Mojin Xiaowei

290
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,200
does get something.

291
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,310
Their skills...

292
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,440
What's wrong?

293
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,750
Being too afraid to walk?

294
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,400
How about lighting up for you?

295
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,440
I didn't say anything.

296
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,160
Hurry, let's go.

297
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,270
The key to it is to learn a lot, right?

298
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,440
He has a wide range of knowledge.

299
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,790
I think...

300
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,830
How skillful a Mojin Xiaowei is.

301
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
There's a saying,

302
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,270
the mighty dragon is
no match for the native serpent.

303
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,070
But I think...

304
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,310
the dragon and serpent are one family.

305
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,920
They don't fight.

306
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,640
Shaanxi is vast...

307
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,440
with many treasures underground.

308
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,240
Let's have a long-term strategic partnership.

309
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,880
You're thinking too much.

310
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,310
We'll see after we get out of here alive.

311
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,680
Eldest brother,

312
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,640
I think we should leave here alive first.

313
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Find the way.

314
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Why did you stop?

315
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
How long have we walked?

316
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,680
My watch stopped.

317
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,590
For about...

318
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
half an hour.

319
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
This path is too long.

320
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,720
Look at this.

321
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,240
Old Hu,

322
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,590
what is this?

323
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,240
This should be...

324
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,000
a symbol to count used by the ancient people.

325
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,790
I saw this crescent symbol before,

326
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,750
so we may have come back here.

327
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,750
What?

328
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,790
You mean...

329
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,680
all of us...

330
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,070
were walking in a circle?

331
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,070
Is this another mechanism?

332
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,400
Shut up.

333
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,400
Stop talking nonsense.

334
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,830
Listen to Mr. Hu, the Mojin Xiaowei.

335
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,440
If I had a solution,

336
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,880
we would have left by now.

337
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,880
Mojin Xiaowei?

338
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
He's just like us,

339
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,400
being stuck here.

340
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,590
Eldest brother,

341
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,000
since we're in this situation,

342
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,590
we shouldn't force him.

343
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,440
Give him some time to think.

344
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
It's fine, Mr. Hu.

345
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,680
Think carefully.

346
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,350
It's fine.

347
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,720
He has said he didn't have a solution.

348
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,830
Normally you're full of ideas, right?

349
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,440
Say something.

350
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,030
I... Brother...

351
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,880
Second brother,

352
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,590
At the crucial moment,

353
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,240
you become silent.

354
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,510
Brother, if I throw a bomb,

355
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,310
it'll blast and light up.

356
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,550
We'll know everything then.

357
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,200
Shut up.

358
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,510
If you throw a bomb and blow everything up,

359
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,590
we'll have to die.

360
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,510
How many times have I told you?

361
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,160
Use your brain.

362
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,160
Use wisdom.

363
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,880
Let's not talk about wisdom.

364
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,240
Old Hu.

365
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,510
How do you know...

366
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,640
this is...

367
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,640
the symbol that you saw previously?

368
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,750
What if many symbols are the same here?

369
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,110
Fatty.

370
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,160
Either it is the one we saw

371
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,000
or they are the same,

372
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,750
we can't leave here now anyway.

373
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Even if we can't leave,

374
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,880
we should find out the reason.

375
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,440
384.

376
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,030
If this symbol...

377
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,680
is the one I saw,

378
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,110
that means for the past half an hour,

379
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,880
we've walked...

380
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,350
384 steps.

381
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,680
Mr. Hu,

382
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
you're so scrupulous.

383
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,070
Enough, stop flattering him.

384
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,160
Forget about it.

385
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,440
Old Hu.

386
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,680
Let's walk one round again.

387
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,960
Let's see if it's the cycle you're talking about.

388
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,440
If there are 384 steps...

389
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,310
and we have 12 people.

390
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,400
Leave one person on every 35 steps.

391
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,920
The last two persons...

392
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,640
just need to walk past 34 steps...

393
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,590
to know if they would come back again.

394
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,510
What if this isn't a circle?

395
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
What if we lose each other?

396
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
Use a rope.

397
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,480
How long is our rope?

398
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,680
Around 100 metres.

399
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,350
That should be enough.

400
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,160
I will be the first one.

401
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,590
No.

402
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,640
What if you escape?

403
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,750
You'll be the first one then.

404
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,030
That won't do either.

405
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,440
What if you push me down?

406
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,750
What do you suggest then?

407
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,750
Together.
[Similar to "Italy" in Chinese]

408
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,270
Italy?

409
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,960
What do you mean?

410
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,480
We'll go together.

411
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,400
Fine.

412
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,000
Fatty,

413
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
light a candle.

414
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Stay here.

415
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,480
Be the first one.

416
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,270
Sure.

417
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,720
I won't budge an inch.

418
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Italy?

419
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,310
What is this place?

420
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,160
It's the same whether I open or close my eyes.

421
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,920
Old Hu.

422
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,160
You are...

423
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,640
No more talking.

424
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,030
