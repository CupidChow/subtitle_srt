[Episode 12]

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,080
Mr. Hu,

4
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,880
you're right.

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,350
I was being a coward.

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,120
But...

7
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,190
it's all your fault.

8
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,710
Fatty almost got killed because of you.

9
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,350
Please don't do that, Old Hu.

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,120
I don't like seeing you upset.

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,390
I know you well.

12
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,070
You'll never harm me.

13
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Besides,

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,710
I'm not afraid of dying.

15
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
But here's the thing.

16
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,320
If we die, we die together.

17
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,600
No one will be left behind.

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,430
Because we're brothers.

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
What?

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,320
I've forgiven you, so stop being sad.

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
Do you feel guilty?

22
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,240
Do you feel sorry for me?

23
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,560
I know you do.

24
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,200
Go away.

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
Take this.

26
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,200
What is this?

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
It's Iron Grinder's Mojin Xiaowei Talisman.

28
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,400
Remember.

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,070
We're a team.

30
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,760
And we must stick together.

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,070
Your grandfather gave it to you.

32
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,040
I can't accept it.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,480
Just take it.

34
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,920
Don't you understand

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
what the meaning is?

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,200
Put it on now.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,680
But...

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,200
let's get one thing straight.

39
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,640
If you wear it now,

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,480
you can't take it off.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,640
Now, every one of us has a talisman.

42
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,040
Does it make us all...

43
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,710
the members of Mojin Xiaowei Sect?

44
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,070
Mojin Xiaowei, united we stand, divided we fall.

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
From now on, we'll be...

46
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,790
partners, friends,

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,870
and comrades.

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,840
Even though I'm not a sect member,

49
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,590
I'm willing...

50
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,120
to be your comrade.

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,840
I think I could be...

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,030
counted into your ally,

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
for we know each other after all.

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,120
Sure, Mr. Jin.

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,400
Thank you.

56
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,000
By the way,

57
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,120
Shirley Yang,

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,430
I will never call you American Girl again.

59
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,680
I've got used to that.

60
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,430
If you start calling me Shirley Yang,

61
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,680
I'll find it very weird.

62
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,280
No, here's the thing.

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
You're the one who got us involved...

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
into the rash curse incident.

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,360
But if it hadn't...

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
been for you,

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,800
I would've been killed by the piranhas.

68
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
That makes us even now.

69
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,840
From now on,

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,750
you'll be part of our team.

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
And I'll call you...

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,750
Chief Yang.

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,630
Chief...

74
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,430
Yang?

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,630
Look,

76
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,470
since Old Hu's our commander,

77
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,080
you'll be our chief of staff.

78
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,120
Fatty,

79
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,680
what's your position?

80
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,680
I'll always be Fatty.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,400
Chief Yang.

82
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,710
It sounds great.

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,430
Then, I'll call you Fatty...

84
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,400
as what Commander Hu does.

85
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,240
You don't see yourself as an outsider at all.

86
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
What did you just say?

87
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,310
Nothing.

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,910
We're going down the temple soon.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,870
That's why we're making fun of ourselves.

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,910
Keep quiet,

91
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,150
otherwise, I'll blow you up.

92
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,280
Eldest Brother, we're here.

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,470
You'll lead the way.

94
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,510
Move.

95
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,600
Come.

96
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,920
Come.

97
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,920
Is this the place?

98
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,920
Yes.

99
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,950
Get out of my way.

100
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,800
Where is the road?

101
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,160
I've blocked it.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Third Brother.

103
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Eldest Brother.

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
Unblock it.

105
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,040
Got it.

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,270
Brother,

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm not trying to nag you here.

108
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,000
But I think this cave is haunted.

109
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
If you blow it up,

110
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
there might be some ghosts in it.

111
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,270
So, all of us must be careful.

112
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,720
I'd rather die...

113
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,680
than be poor.

114
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,920
Third Brother.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,800
Coming.

116
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,390
Step aside.

117
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,160
He doesn't seem reliable.

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,270
Step aside,

119
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm going to blow it up now.

120
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,560
Step aside.

121
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,190
Eldest Brother.

122
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
Step back.

123
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,830
Get away from here.

124
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Step back.

125
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,950
Stay still.

126
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,040
Get away from here.

127
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,160
Eldest Brother,

128
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,750
watch this.

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Eldest Brother,

130
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,830
it's too much.

131
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,750
Like I said,

132
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,040
he's not reliable at all.

133
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,750
Now.

134
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,600
Old Hu,

135
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,310
we've been here.

136
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,390
This way.

137
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,190
Old Hu.

138
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,560
Didn't we hide it here?

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What is this?

140
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,600
A Western Zhou dynasty...

141
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,680
bronze tripod.

142
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,070
If we manage to get it out of here,

143
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,830
we'll become very rich.

144
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,950
It's really a good thing.

145
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,320
Don't forget to take it when we leave.

146
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,080
Eldest Brother,

147
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,240
it's quite heavy.

148
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,630
I don't care.

149
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,480
Use your brain.

150
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,840
They're all good things.

151
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,550
Let's go.

152
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,120
Come on.

153
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,080
Old Hu,

154
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
are we on the right track?

155
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,480
Hey,

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,510
are you...

157
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,030
trying to get us into the lost caverns?

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
What's going on here?

159
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,790
Don't you play tricks on us.

160
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,630
Why would I do so? You're armed after all.

161
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,750
Trust me. Just follow me.

162
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,790
Why did we give in to him?

163
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,320
That's very humiliating.

164
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,440
Old Hu,

165
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,600
didn't we...

166
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,030
find Mr. Jin's footprint here?

167
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,440
Brothers,

168
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,870
I feel I was here before.

169
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,080
There's a face over there.

170
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,240
Mr. Hu,

171
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,910
it looks exactly like...

172
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,510
the ghost I saw.

173
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,270
Don't be afraid.

174
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,720
It's just a decorative statue.

175
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,000
Since the statue is here,

176
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,550
there might be a tomb nearby.

177
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,390
Mr. Hu,

178
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,150
don't you find its expression...

179
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,870
a bit...

180
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,720
fake?

181
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,790
It doesn't look sincere at all.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
You're right.

183
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,480
You can't say it's smiling...

184
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,390
because it looks like an insincere smile.

185
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,670
But you can't say it's being angry...

186
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,670
because it seems to be mocking us.

187
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
In short,

188
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,270
it doesn't look like a human expression.

189
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,600
Enough,

190
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,870
you're scaring yourself.

191
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,030
Let's go now.

192
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,840
Old Hu.

193
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,120
What?

194
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,000
That face moved.

195
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,440
Really?

196
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
Mr Hu said...

197
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,870
it's a stone statue.

198
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
A stone statue can't move.

199
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Did you make a mistake?

200
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,630
No.

201
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,120
It was crying.

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,120
And now it's smiling.

203
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,150
Third Brother, what are you doing?

204
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,150
Why are you looking at me?

205
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,510
Let's smash it to find out
whether it is a statue or a ghost.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,670
Indeed.

207
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,000
Stop.

208
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,910
Hurry up.

209
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,750
Hurry up.

210
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,510
Keep up.

211
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,720
-Old Jin.
-Mr. Jin.

212
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,840
Mr. Jin.

213
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,720
Old Jin, stop running.

214
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,000
Ghost!

215
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,960
Ghost!

216
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,000
Stop!

217
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,960
Come on!

218
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,870
Eldest Brother.

219
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,080
Almost killed me.

220
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,870
Are you alright?

221
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,480
I'm fine.

222
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,790
Where are we?

223
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,150
It's so dirty here.

224
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,270
It's full of pits and holes. I fell badly.

225
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,080
Are you alright?

226
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,440
How did I fall into it again?

227
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm so unlucky.

228
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,480
Old Hu,

229
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,480
what's...

230
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,600
on your body?

231
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,390
Mr. Hu,

232
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,320
I need some light here.

233
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,030
Something's under my foot.

234
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,390
Is it going to explode?

235
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,320
Come and take a look at it.

236
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,600
I dare not move.

237
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,350
What is this?

238
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,200
I was scared to death.

239
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,680
Are you okay?

240
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,510
Are you alright?

241
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,030
Be careful.

242
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,200
Are you alright?

243
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,720
Are you alright?

244
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,750
Are you hurt?

245
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,160
What's wrong?

246
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,510
What is this?

247
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,270
What's wrong?

248
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,070
It's the ancestor of spiders.

249
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,350
Eldest Brother, what should we do now?

250
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,880
Why are there so many of them?

251
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,030
What should we do?

252
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,160
What the hell are these?

253
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,790
Old Jin.

254
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,920
Spiders are scared of fire. Where's the torch?

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Quick, light the torch.

256
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,160
Hurry up. Light the torch.

257
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,960
Light the torch.

258
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,590
Light it.

259
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,350
Come on.

260
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,110
Burn them to death.

261
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,750
Burn there.

262
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,830
They're giant golden orb-weavers.

263
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,640
I read about them in National Geographic.

264
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,720
They only feed on fruit flies.
And they don't attack humans.

265
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,200
What's this?

266
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,880
You should stop buying that kind of magazine.

267
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,720
Get up.

268
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,440
Eldest Brother.

269
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,440
What do we do?

270
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,400
Let's go now.

271
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,110
Explode.

272
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,680
Which...

273
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,790
Which...

274
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,440
Which one should I blow?

275
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,720
There's an exit over there.

276
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,880
Let's go.

277
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,270
Now.

278
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,880
Let's go now.

279
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
Go! Go!

280
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,550
Go now, Eldest Brother.

281
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,550
Leave here now.

282
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,400
Go, Brother!

283
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Hurry up.

284
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,400
Quick.

285
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Hurry up.

286
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,640
Come.

287
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,310
Hurry up.

288
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,720
Come on!

289
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,160
Goodbye.

290
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,590
Eldest Brother.

291
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,960
Seventh Brother.

292
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,720
Leave.

293
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,240
Go.

294
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:35,880
Third Brother.

295
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,550
Get away from here.

296
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,160
Hu Ba Yi.

297
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,350
Old Jin.

298
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,400
Watch out.

299
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,920
Are you alright?

300
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's go.

301
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,920
Come on.

302
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,000
Ninth Brother, give me the torch.

303
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,640
Okay.

304
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,440
Eldest Brother.

305
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,920
Eldest Brother.

306
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,030
Ninth Brother.

307
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Ninth Brother.

308
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,030
Ninth Brother.

309
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,350
Ninth Brother.

310
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,680
Brother, let's go.

311
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,270
Get out of here.

312
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,880
Now.

313
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,590
Come on!

314
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,680
Go.

315
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,200
Fatty.

316
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,350
Old Hu.

317
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,640
That spider is pulling me.

318
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,510
Fatty, hang in there. Harder.

319
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,680
Are you alright?

320
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,640
Where's Old Jin?

321
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,160
Mr. Hu.

322
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
Mr. Hu.

323
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,110
Come on.

324
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,680
Old Jin.

325
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,350
Old Jin.

326
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:18,880
Mr. Hu.

327
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:19,920
Old Jin.

328
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,680
Old Jin.

329
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,830
Help!

330
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,680
Here, quick.

331
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,350
Old Jin.

332
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,270
Come down.

333
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,680
Old Jin.

334
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,270
Old Jin.

335
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,270
Old Jin.

336
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,920
Old Jin.

337
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,590
Are you alright?

338
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,110
Old Jin.

339
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,300
[Prospecting team]

340
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,720
It's a prospector.

341
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,000
This is supposed to be a diary.

342
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,000
Nuclear fission.

343
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,920
What does this mean?

344
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,240
It's a nuclear reaction between...

345
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,070
the uranium in a mine and groundwater.

346
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,440
Such reaction produces
a lot of nuclear radiation.

347
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,640
Take a look.

348
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,720
It's written...

349
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,350
all the living things nearby have been
affected by the nuclear radiation.

350
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,310
That means...

351
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,960
the nuclear radiation...

352
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,880
made the spiders gigantic.

353
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,830
Keep reading it.

354
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,200
Is there any way to get rid of them?

355
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,070
No.

356
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,590
Old Jin.

357
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,680
Don't move.

358
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,550
Stay still.

359
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,400
No.

360
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:02,880
Fatty,

361
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,680
get me the shovel.
