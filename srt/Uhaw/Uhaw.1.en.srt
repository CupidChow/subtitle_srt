1
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:51,516
Whenever each night reaches my thoughts,

2
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:57,454
times when we were still free
in each other's arms.

3
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:03,188
As the warmth of our bodies combine...

4
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:09,688
Each bead of sweat merge together...

5
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,672
Exchanging breaths,

6
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:21,329
each strand of our hair brushing together.

7
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:26,329
Reminders of the promise that you are mine.

8
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,626
And that I am yours.

9
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:39,002
Slowly the cold truth pierces us,

10
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:46,747
that all these thoughts

11
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:51,220
are now just memories.

12
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,594
Always remembered,

13
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:58,649
but will never return.

14
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,547
Because you're here,

15
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,110
but not the kisses.

16
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,221
You're here,

17
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,477
but not the light in your eyes
that speak with each look.

18
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,665
You left your wifey unsatisfied, babe.

19
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,438
Damn that alarm.

20
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,329
[sighs]

21
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,883
You were so good.

22
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,774
Well if...

23
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:00,860
our dreams are in sync,

24
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:03,172
you know how to end it.

25
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:04,197
Right?

26
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,766
Please wake up.

27
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:11,680
Aren't you tired of virtual sex?

28
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,587
You're not even abroad.

29
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,290
Joke.

30
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:18,719
Happy birthday.

31
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:23,105
I love you, babe.

32
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,124
Ma'am!

33
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:30,036
Hi. I'm sorry I let myself in.
The door was open.

34
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,061
That's okay.

35
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,504
Let me help you with that.

36
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,515
- Alright. Thank you.
- Okay.

37
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,780
- I'll leave you to it.
- Yes, ma'am.

38
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:45,594
Ma?

39
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:47,373
Hello, Rejoice.

40
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,349
How's Marcus?

41
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,615
He's alright, mom.

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,834
He's stable.

43
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,224
Have you done the favor I asked?

44
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,724
Marcus's aunt referred
a medical facility in Ontario.

45
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:06,622
Have you checked with his doctor
if he could get a clearance to travel?

46
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,833
Ah...

47
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:11,873
Mom, I think his doctor
here is really good.

48
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:17,505
And maybe, it's better if he stays near
his close friends here.

49
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,278
Rejoice, you have to start
thinking of what's best for my son.

50
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:25,884
I mean, your husband.

51
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,318
I think he's fine, Ma.

52
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:29,583
We're doing fine.

53
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:30,909
Um...

54
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:33,290
Wouldn't it be more dangerous if

55
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,279
he travels in that condition?

56
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,590
Alright then.

57
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,927
I'll visit there again soon
to check on him, okay?

58
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,451
We can talk more then.

59
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,150
Okay.

60
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,263
You're here,

61
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,794
but not the feeling

62
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:08,334
that you made me feel every minute.

63
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,728
Hey.

64
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,029
Babes.

65
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:16,537
Why does your inking feel so rough today?

66
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:19,263
Relax, babe.

67
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:20,740
It's like you're not used to it.

68
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,458
Yes, I'm not used to this.

69
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,443
Well, you're not this rough usually.

70
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:27,130
Really? I'm sorry.

71
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,904
Babe...

72
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:34,929
Hmm?

73
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,607
- Yes?
- I was just thinking…

74
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,909
What's that?

75
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:41,834
What if we lived in the States?

76
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:45,457
States? Where did
that idea come from?

77
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:48,185
Well...

78
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:51,193
I'm stuck doing bar gigs here

79
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:53,989
and I have a lot of competition.

80
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,240
Babe, do you think you
won't have competition there?

81
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:01,931
Relax, babe.

82
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,779
You'll get your big break.

83
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:06,834
I believe in you.

84
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:07,942
Okay?

85
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,193
I just think there are
more opportunities there.

86
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,586
What opportunities?

87
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,073
I have a friend who's a teacher there,

88
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:24,029
and now they have
their own computer shop.

89
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:28,513
And my other friend there is a nurse there.

90
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:31,694
Babe...

91
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,740
We just opened our own tattoo shop.

92
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,006
Did we have to go there to do that?

93
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:39,606
No, right?

94
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:41,951
Babe...

95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,029
Don't lose faith in yourself.

96
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,380
You're beautiful

97
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:52,466
and I'm good looking.

98
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,591
A lot of people want to be us.

99
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:59,474
You just want to get away
from my mom, huh?

100
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:00,599
- Hey!
- Am I right?

101
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:03,505
No way! I love your mom.

102
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,171
Ouch!

103
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:21,934
Babe?

104
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:25,022
Ouch!

105
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,704
- Babe?
- Hold on, babe.

106
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:29,139
I just need some water.

107
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:31,342
Babe, are you okay?

108
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:35,491
[speaking gibberish]

109
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:36,634
Babe!

110
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,663
Babe!

111
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:40,335
- It hurts!
- Babe?

112
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,321
- It hurts!
- Babe!

113
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,999
- It hurts!
- Babe!

114
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,928
Marcus!

115
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,115
You're there.

116
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:54,490
But are you really here?

117
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:06,342
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

118
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,943
Happy birthday!

119
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,976
The birthday boy is upstairs.

120
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:13,128
He's still sleeping?

121
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:15,639
Wake him up!

122
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,404
He doesn't want to.

123
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,309
Why don't you give it a try?
It might just work.

124
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,725
Okay, I'll try. I'll go on top of him!

125
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,920
You're so weird!

126
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,256
Happy birthday to you.

127
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:33,507
Yes!

128
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:39,826
Marcus is still so handsome.

129
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,201
A bit slim, but still handsome.

130
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:46,263
How are you?
We miss you at the bar.

131
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,865
You know how it is.

132
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,663
Caretaker duties.

133
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,103
Well...

134
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:57,232
You won't let me do live streams.

135
00:08:58,615 --> 00:08:59,931
You'll be back, eventually.

136
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,583
Is there any news from his doctor?

137
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,645
Um... Well...

138
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,975
They couldn't give a timeline,
but it's probably going to be a while.

139
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,711
Shit.

140
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:09,736
So...

141
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,014
Question. Please don't be mad, okay?

142
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:18,037
- Aren't you dried up, already?
- Hey!

143
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,186
Shush!

144
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,588
- Next question please.
- Okay.

145
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,551
I have a gift.

146
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:30,420
Not sure if this is for you,
or for Marcus. Here.

147
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,848
- What's this?
- Open it.

148
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,166
My boyfriend works at

149
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,669
at Greenhills as a technician.

150
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,334
I asked him to repair that.

151
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:47,297
Thank you.

152
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:49,225
Wait...

153
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:51,842
I miss hearing Rejoice singing at the bar,

154
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,654
- play something, yeah?
- Right.

155
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,236
Just one original song.

156
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:57,068
- I'm not ready.
- Go!

157
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,365
You missed me too much.

158
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,857
Very much.

159
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,543
Hey!

160
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:14,201
Who are you

161
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:19,951
to make me nervous?

162
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,264
Do you remember

163
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:27,552
the first time we met?

164
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:32,787
Just one look from you,
my heart skipped a bit.

165
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,357
[singing]

166
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,790
Hi, Kayla!

167
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,318
Thanks for covering my shifts.

168
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm just exhausting my leave, yeah?

169
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,427
I promise I'll be back in a month.

170
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:51,638
And can you also give
Mrs. Simon's medical chart for me?

171
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,319
Thank you so much.

172
00:10:53,813 --> 00:11:03,703
hoy!
Sung by: Ataska

173
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,671
And in awe and shaking.

174
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:11,736
I'm not usually like this.
My heart fell for you.

175
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,791
I'm so full.

176
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,323
Just call us if you need anything.

177
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,003
Visit us at the bar sometime.

178
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,028
If you have time.

179
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,089
You need to rest, also.

180
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,784
You might end up in a coma next.

181
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,978
Don't say that! Geez!

182
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,920
Let's go. Our ride is here. Bye!

183
00:13:57,945 --> 00:13:59,503
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

184
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,361
- Thank you.
- Bye.

185
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:02,595
Happy birthday!

186
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,878
Take care.

187
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,122
- Sit there.
- Okay.

188
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,982
Bye!

189
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:20,794
Ma'am Rejoice,

190
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,904
I'll go ahead.

191
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,988
Okay. Take care.

192
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,481
By the way,

193
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:31,005
you still owe a few months balance
on our agency.

194
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:37,341
They told me not to show up
until you settle that.

195
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,395
Um...

196
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:45,410
I'm really sorry,
can I get another extension?

197
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:49,735
That was your second extension, ma'am.

198
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,916
I might end up in trouble.

199
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:55,654
Maybe you can find a way?

200
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,070
Alright, I'll talk to our agency.

201
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,494
I'll go ahead.

202
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,380
- Thank you.
- Take care.

203
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,544
- You too.
- Bye.

204
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:27,166
Do you remember your birthday last year?

205
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,872
We had so many guests.

206
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,857
Around 30, I think.

207
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,079
That was fun, right?

208
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,175
Actually,

209
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,953
I invited them again.

210
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:52,659
But...

211
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,437
I don't know...

212
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,191
You're still here.

213
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,544
But it seems like...

214
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,125
they're gradually disappearing.

215
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:09,906
But it doesn't matter.

216
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:14,758
Those who genuinely love you,
came today.

217
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,387
Those who love us.

218
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,468
Look!

219
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,444
They still know your size, babe.

220
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,021
But I think you're down
to medium or small now.

221
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:38,441
But it's okay.

222
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:40,817
Once you wake up,

223
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,839
we'll get you back to large, okay?

224
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:47,460
Oh, right.

225
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:50,160
Conrad asked

226
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,507
his boyfriend

227
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:54,664
to fix your phone.

228
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:59,850
Our last pictures together are still here.

229
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:01,616
Look.

230
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,547
Look.

231
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:39,720
[singing]

232
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:42,389
- All I'm asking for
- Go, babe!

233
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:47,946
- is for you to love me.
- That's my wife! I love you!

234
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:49,693
I love you too!

235
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:55,572
What should I do

236
00:17:55,597 --> 00:18:00,220
to have you?

237
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:02,040
[cheering]

238
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:08,142
Hey! My feelings for you
won't disappear.

239
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,381
Don't push me away.

240
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:13,517
Please don't. Hey!

241
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,994
I'm on fire.

242
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:18,864
My feelings are ablaze.

243
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,798
Overflowing in my heart.

244
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,549
You and I

245
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,877
hopefully end up together.

246
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:35,244
You and I together.

247
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,767
You and I together.

248
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:43,289
[cheering]

249
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:44,752
I'm Rejoice, by the way.

250
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:47,806
And if you have any requests,

251
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:51,205
I'll sing them, along with your tip.

252
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,775
Thank you, sir.

253
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:10,650
- You asshole! Damn pervert!
- Babe!

254
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:13,140
- Marcus!
- Stop it!

255
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:14,258
Damn you!

256
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,058
Screw you!

257
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,033
- Bastard!
- Marcus!

258
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,551
You touched my wife!

259
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,947
What's your problem?

260
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,531
If I see that guy one more time,

261
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,892
he'll get more than a beating.

262
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:34,207
What if he had a gun?

263
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:36,944
Or a knife?

264
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,207
You could have died.

265
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:46,853
So what?

266
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,489
At least I died fighting for you.

267
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:54,684
That's ugly.

268
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,137
What do you mean?

269
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What?

270
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,317
That's an ugly way to die.

271
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:05,996
And you can

272
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,160
never be ugly.

273
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,523
Why?

274
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,581
If I become ugly,

275
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,213
you'll stop loving me?

276
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,795
Babe, quit your job at the bar.

277
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,084
I'm earning enough.

278
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:29,029
I'll take care of us.

279
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,178
I really need this job, babe.

280
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,023
For what?

281
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:40,655
For our baby.

282
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,890
Baby?

283
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:45,991
You're pregnant?

284
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:49,321
No.

285
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:50,676
But...

286
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,553
I'm ready now.

287
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
That's why

288
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:57,583
we need to save up
as much as we can.

289
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:05,573
I love you, babe.

290
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:07,296
I know.

291
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:08,782
I love you, too.

292
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,569
[humming]

293
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:25,233
[humming]

294
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:29,514
[humming]

295
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,053
Is that baby talk?

296
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:40,522
[babbling]

297
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:52,199
hoy!
Sung by: Ataska

298
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:40,984
You bitch!
Come here.

299
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,906
Damn you! Come here.

300
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:45,475
You slut.

301
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,654
Hey! Come with me!

302
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,398
You damn whore!

303
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,423
Ouch!

304
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,689
Here! Come here!

305
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:53,946
There!

306
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,070
There!

307
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,095
There he is!

308
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,740
There's the guy you wanted to see, right?

309
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,546
You damn bitch!

310
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:01,851
There, suck him!

311
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:04,169
Have sex with him!
You bitch!

312
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,585
Go on!

313
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:08,576
I'm sorry.

314
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:10,351
I'm sorry.

315
00:26:58,442 --> 00:26:59,941
Are you Marcus?

316
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,768
Why? Do I look different?

317
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,862
You actually look better in person.

318
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:14,401
Hmm...

319
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,401
Actually,

320
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,201
you look like my ex.

321
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:21,080
Is that true, ma'am?

322
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:24,956
Your ex must've been
really good looking.

323
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:28,667
My ex is a woman.

324
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,232
A woman?

325
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:33,737
For real? Are you serious?

326
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,807
- I'm just joking.
- Really?

327
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:36,832
Oh...

328
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,279
I thought your ex was really a girl.

329
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Ma'am...

330
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:46,847
Are we really doing this here?

331
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:50,594
Hey!

332
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:53,722
Don't call me ma'am.

333
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,690
It makes me feel old.

334
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:57,955
Okay.

335
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:02,492
Call me Astrid.

336
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:05,857
Okay.

337
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:06,882
Astrid.

338
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,107
Uh...

339
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:13,406
Ma'am...

340
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,318
Can I...

341
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,507
first get the...

342
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:18,532
The...

343
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,010
Thank you, ma'am.

344
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,573
Hey.

345
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,981
Why do you look so nervous?

346
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:00,840
No, ma'am.

347
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,700
I mean, no, Astrid.

348
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:05,043
Uh...

349
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:10,175
With your beauty,
you don't need to pay to get a guy.

350
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,186
It's because if I don't pay,

351
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,123
I feel like I always need to perform.

352
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,098
And I'm just so stressed right now.

353
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:34,997
I just want to

354
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,129
be satisfied.

355
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:44,551
Is that weird?

356
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:46,560
No, it's not.

357
00:29:58,551 --> 00:29:59,901
Should we start?

358
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,294
Thank you.

359
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:04,936
You were great.

360
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,157
It was my first time.

361
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:10,857
Huh?

362
00:32:11,985 --> 00:32:13,345
You're a virgin?

363
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,782
- No.
- I can't believe you.

364
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:18,008
I mean...

365
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,032
It's my first time like this.
Getting paid for it.

366
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:26,985
Wow.

367
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,782
Do you really need that much money?

368
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:32,446
It's not that.

369
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:36,437
I just want to provide for my wife.

370
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:41,290
Do you love her?

371
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:51,077
Of course.

372
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,390
Would I have married her if I didn't?

373
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,906
You've got a lot of questions,
are we that close already?

374
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,404
- Hey. What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

375
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,623
We've almost dried up our savings.

376
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,528
But I'll find a way to earn more.

377
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:22,535
I was just thinking

378
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,755
about all the things I gave up.

379
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,679
But there's one thing I didn't give up.

380
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:39,016
You.

381
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,499
I always thought

382
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,223
that everything was worth it.

383
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:51,339
Because you love me.

384
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,942
You love me so much.

385
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,841
You never cheated on me,

386
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,497
you wouldn't cheat on me.

387
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,763
But how ironic,

388
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:13,333
you're the one asleep

389
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,294
but I'm the one who woke up.

390
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:19,387
Now I have to stay up,

391
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:23,661
waiting,

392
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:27,411
if you can explain

393
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,786
or even apologize.

394
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:38,825
Sometimes I just want to give up.

395
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,442
I'm so tired.

396
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm exhausted.

397
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:12,962
I thought I've found the one.

398
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,406
Will be my protection from the rain.

399
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:30,563
But now your songs have turned into lies.

400
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:34,609
How do we become like this?

401
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,547
I already gave you everything.

402
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:45,446
But you're still looking for my faults.

403
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:48,348
Please try to be true.

404
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:52,835
Why can't you accept that?

405
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:58,508
Aching to be with you,
but you don't feel the same.

406
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,469
You won't leave my thoughts.

407
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,722
You've wasted my time.

408
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:09,269
Why did you lead me on?

409
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:15,024
I told myself

410
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:21,906
it's better to get hurt
than to feel nothing.

411
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,390
Damn you!

412
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:17,380
Damn them!

413
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,622
You know what, Marcus?

414
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,871
Screw you!

415
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:46,425
Screw you!

416
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:51,651
Damn you
for leaving me alone.

417
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,606
You think everything's fine?

418
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:03,294
Damn you for making me
think everything will be fine.

419
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:07,528
It's so hard.

420
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:08,924
It's so hard.

421
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:14,060
It's so hard not to hear your voice,

422
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:18,566
not to hold you,
or hug you even once.

423
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,958
Just one hug...

424
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,470
Even...

425
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:57,411
Rejoice!

426
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:01,869
Rejoice!

427
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,544
I didn't know where to take you

428
00:41:18,864 --> 00:41:21,325
so I brought you home.

429
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,819
You're really wasted.

430
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:31,981
It's a good thing I saw you.

431
00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:36,731
Who knows what
could've happened to you.

432
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:44,903
I'll stay with you until you're okay.

433
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:46,648
Okay?

434
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:48,705
I'm okay.

435
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:50,278
Go home.

436
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:00,216
I think you have a fever.

437
00:42:03,093 --> 00:42:04,286
Don't worry,

438
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:06,145
I'll take care of you.

439
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:09,724
I'm okay, just leave!

440
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:16,474
I can't because I promised
Marcus I'll take care of you!

441
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:22,911
Do you know how we met?

442
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:29,888
Because he knew for a long time
that something like this will happen.

443
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:36,091
He's been feeling sick
for a while, Rejoice.

444
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:40,988
So he's been saving money for it

445
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:43,325
but he didn't want anyone to know.

446
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:45,231
He kept it from everybody.

447
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:52,388
It's a good thing he met me first,

448
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,981
because he didn't need
to find another client.

449
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:01,427
He's lucky

450
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:04,973
because since the very beginning

451
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:07,356
I was with him.

452
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:09,599
From his check-ups

453
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:11,638
to his treatments.

454
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:14,177
Even this shop!

455
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:17,310
It's all because of me.

456
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:27,677
And I'm never going to walk away
from my promises to Marcus.

457
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:33,192
So, no matter what you do,

458
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,536
no matter how hard you push me away,

459
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,544
I'll stay.

460
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,895
Let's rest, Rejoice.

461
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:04,489
We're both tired.

462
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:38,175
I can't sleep from thinking about you.

463
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:48,018
It started when you left me.

464
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:55,499
You're singing such a sad song.

465
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,694
Maybe we can liven it up a little.

466
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:03,395
How can I make it happier,
when I'm not happy.

467
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,870
Because I'll do

468
00:45:07,445 --> 00:45:08,702
whatever it takes

469
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:10,605
to make you happy.

470
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,350
I love you, babe.

471
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:18,062
Hey!

472
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:22,585
Hold on.

473
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,071
Sing it again.

474
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:28,312
I can't sleep from thinking of you.

475
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:34,705
It started when you left me.

476
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:39,195
What did I do to you?

477
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:43,148
[humming]

478
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,041
We're even now, Marcus.

479
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:07,695
But I'm no longer happy.

480
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:24,293
Agnes!

481
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:25,774
Agnes!

482
00:49:26,128 --> 00:49:27,436
Agnes!

483
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:46,489
Marcus,

484
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:49,058
follow this light.

485
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,390
Marcus,

486
00:49:54,256 --> 00:49:55,533
can you hear me?

487
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:04,092
Sorry I ran into traffic coming here
from the airport.

488
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:06,107
Doc, how is my son?

489
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:08,600
The tears you saw

490
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:11,264
was possibly just a random body reflex.

491
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,850
There's still no indication that
he's aware of his surroundings.

492
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,193
Let's give him a few more days.

493
00:50:20,163 --> 00:50:22,850
How many days is a few more, doc?

494
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,474
We always wait for a few more.

495
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:27,850
Please be patient.

496
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,553
We still have a long fight ahead of us.

497
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:47,193
Aching to be with you,
but you don't feel the same.

498
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:50,172
You won't leave my thoughts.

499
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,801
You've wasted my time.

500
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:58,492
Why did you lead me on?

501
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:17,841
You made me like you,
but you didn't love me.

502
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,866
Once again...

503
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:21,660
You won't leave my thoughts.

504
00:51:21,685 --> 00:51:25,265
You wasted my time.

505
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,591
Why did my fate turn out like this?

506
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:41,515
Di INIBIG
Sung by: Ataska

507
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:51,708
I let myself to be toyed with.

508
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,750
Why are you acting hard to get?

509
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,471
I'll pay again.
Take these off!

510
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:47,071
Hey!

511
00:52:47,854 --> 00:52:49,231
Damn you!

512
00:52:50,995 --> 00:52:53,052
Leave! Get out!

513
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,693
Get out!

514
00:52:58,051 --> 00:52:59,380
Are you okay?

515
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:44,762
How are you?

516
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:48,302
I'm okay.

517
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:50,247
Tell me the truth.

518
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:52,404
Can you still do this?

519
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,897
I'm having a hard time but...

520
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:03,731
I can keep going.

521
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:11,826
I'm sure you couldn't have imagined
things turning out like this.

522
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:17,863
When you and my son
decided to marry young,

523
00:54:19,907 --> 00:54:23,772
all you could see then
was the beauty of your youth,

524
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:27,030
how you so wanted to consume that

525
00:54:27,261 --> 00:54:29,725
every single day with each other.

526
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,387
But this is...

527
00:54:38,246 --> 00:54:41,326
the real face of love, Rejoice.

528
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,569
It's...

529
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,637
when you have nothing left to give,

530
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:47,795
but...

531
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:52,545
it continues to consume you.

532
00:54:55,514 --> 00:54:57,733
And I'm just not sure

533
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:01,405
if this is something you can do

534
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:02,906
for my son.

535
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,173
Ma...

536
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,489
I'm doing my best.

537
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:16,264
I'm sacrificing a lot.

538
00:55:17,006 --> 00:55:18,006
In what way?

539
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:41,397
If this is your idea of sacrifice,

540
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:45,732
then I don't want you
anywhere near my son.

541
00:55:50,073 --> 00:55:53,006
I'll be giving you two weeks
to make plans for yourself.

542
00:55:53,156 --> 00:55:54,561
By that time,

543
00:55:54,749 --> 00:55:57,350
I'll take Marcus home.

544
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:04,574
Ma...

545
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:08,381
Don't call me Mom.

546
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,405
You don't deserve that.

547
00:56:18,944 --> 00:56:20,427
Rejoice, the video has spread,

548
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,005
The bar is also recognizable.

549
00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:26,988
I've been told to tell you to lie low
until the issue dies down.

550
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,858
Promise I'll call you when
things get back to normal.

551
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:07,944
Hello?

552
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,350
Hello, Rejoice.

553
00:57:38,595 --> 00:57:40,236
I don't need money.

554
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:41,973
I need someone to talk to.

555
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:16,514
Shit.

556
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:19,174
What are we? Twins?

557
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,202
I paid him to put that.

558
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,325
I know your story.

559
00:58:32,729 --> 00:58:36,143
You met at a bar where
you were having your gig.

560
00:58:46,904 --> 00:58:47,904
You know what?

561
00:58:48,473 --> 00:58:50,449
I always go to her gigs.

562
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:52,887
Watching her,

563
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,011
listening to her.

564
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:59,441
I was so amazed by her.

565
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,408
You know why?

566
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,433
Because she wrote all of her songs.

567
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:10,363
Amazing, right?

568
00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:15,118
That's why I used to imagine

569
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,855
that if my eyes could see

570
00:59:21,175 --> 00:59:23,480
what her songs made me feel...

571
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,917
It would look like this.

572
00:59:37,905 --> 00:59:39,949
I must be a masochist,

573
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:46,660
because every time I'm with him,

574
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:49,543
he only talks about you.

575
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:54,160
Your love story

576
00:59:56,746 --> 00:59:58,433
and how much he loves you.

577
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,856
And every time,

578
01:00:07,965 --> 01:00:10,230
I wasn't falling in love with him,

579
01:00:13,952 --> 01:00:16,331
I was falling in love
with what you had.

580
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,519
The love you two shared.

581
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,691
I never wanted to steal him, okay?

582
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:29,238
That's weird.

583
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,629
I just want to be a part of it.

584
01:00:37,026 --> 01:00:38,824
I want to take care of him.

585
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:44,043
The two of you.

586
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:51,113
Whatever you two had.

587
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:56,512
You're more of an addict than me.

588
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:01,700
Maybe.

589
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:06,302
I don't know. But...

590
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:09,051
It seems that way.

591
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,926
I want to kill you.

592
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:28,467
But...

593
01:01:29,441 --> 01:01:30,660
it seems that

594
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:34,754
you're the only one I have right now.

595
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,970
So, you have no other choice, huh?

596
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:48,981
Pretty much.

597
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:23,526
Geez!

598
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,389
Ma'am!

599
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:51,522
You're too drunk.

600
01:02:51,927 --> 01:02:53,356
We're okay.

601
01:02:54,009 --> 01:02:56,548
- We're fine. You can go ahead.
- I'll go now.

602
01:02:57,054 --> 01:02:58,425
Take care.

603
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,882
Be careful.

604
01:03:19,282 --> 01:03:22,358
I'm so tired of taking care of him.

605
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:31,327
I miss how things were before.

606
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:36,717
I miss him.

607
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:44,499
I miss being with someone.

608
01:03:59,428 --> 01:04:01,394
I'll be here.

609
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:06,803
I'll be with you.

610
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:45,095
Ah!

611
01:07:48,237 --> 01:07:49,447
Um...

612
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:52,799
I'll go ahead.

613
01:07:53,431 --> 01:07:55,510
I just waited for you to wake up.

614
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:01,057
Call me if you need anything.

615
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:03,150
Don't go home yet.

616
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:06,947
Ah, Rejoice...

617
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:11,298
About last night…

618
01:08:14,941 --> 01:08:17,188
We were too high.

619
01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:19,064
It's okay.

620
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:20,767
Let's forget about it.

621
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,780
Keep playing.

622
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:28,415
Please.

623
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,080
Astrid!

624
01:09:20,969 --> 01:09:23,769
If you're the way

625
01:09:24,485 --> 01:09:26,666
to make him wake up,

626
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:29,883
I won't stop you from visiting him.

627
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:33,172
Rejoice...

628
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:37,039
It was just a coincidence.

629
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:41,702
I'm only going to come if you tell me to.

630
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,078
You're the one he needs.

631
01:09:52,023 --> 01:09:55,062
I'll help you, only if you need it.

632
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:13,014
Girl!

633
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:21,419
Rejoice!

634
01:10:22,314 --> 01:10:23,314
What was that?

635
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:29,593
I let her visit.

636
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:34,058
Conrad, she played for Marcus

637
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,570
and his hand moved.

638
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:36,766
If...

639
01:10:37,008 --> 01:10:40,670
If she's the way to make
him wake up, I'll let her...

640
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,203
No! Don't let her win.

641
01:10:42,228 --> 01:10:43,468
Don't let her win.

642
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:45,464
If she can make his hands move,

643
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:48,921
you can make his head, his arm,

644
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:50,679
his penis, you can do that.

645
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,312
Come here. Come with me.

646
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:54,078
What is going on with you?

647
01:10:54,103 --> 01:10:56,414
Come here. What's wrong with you?

648
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:59,289
What's gotten into you?

649
01:10:59,314 --> 01:11:03,249
Don't forget, she's the reason why
you went crazy at the bar.

650
01:11:03,512 --> 01:11:06,710
I'm just saying, you're his wife and...

651
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:51,224
Marcus is awake.

652
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:53,742
There's a Thanksgiving party
at the bar. You're invited.

653
01:14:33,565 --> 01:14:35,258
Thank you, guys,
for coming tonight.

654
01:14:35,283 --> 01:14:36,317
Uh...

655
01:14:36,342 --> 01:14:39,134
Marcus's progress has been good.

656
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:42,766
So, please, stay with us
for the rest of our journey.

657
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:44,657
This is a song I wrote.

658
01:14:44,682 --> 01:14:45,722
For

659
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:46,747
him.

660
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,085
We started

661
01:15:06,972 --> 01:15:09,136
from nothing.

Did you really just wake up now?

664
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:15,118
Or have you been hearing
everything I said before?

665
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:20,438
[muffled speaking]

666
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:26,390
Now that you're awake...

667
01:17:28,254 --> 01:17:30,383
Can I ask you something?

668
01:17:40,298 --> 01:17:41,993
Did you love Astrid?

669
01:17:44,399 --> 01:18:05,423

[muffled speaking]

675
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:12,699
Hello?

676
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,092
Where are you?

677
01:19:35,426 --> 01:19:37,273
Why did you only show up now?

678
01:19:38,943 --> 01:19:41,602
Do you think I could face the people there?

679
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:45,321
With your friends and family there?

680
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,227
Are you okay?

681
01:22:47,642 --> 01:22:48,880
Rejoice...

682
01:22:49,829 --> 01:22:50,829
Wake up.

683
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:55,044
You're still here.

684
01:22:57,258 --> 01:22:58,468
I'm about to go home.

685
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:03,011
I don't think I can do this alone.

686
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:06,458
Astrid, I need your help.

687
01:23:08,044 --> 01:23:09,462
Rejoice...

688
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:12,107
Marcus needs you more.

689
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:18,708
The time will come when he'll give you
everything you need.

690
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,856
And all your sacrifices will be repaid.

691
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:29,818
What if...

692
01:23:32,534 --> 01:23:34,318
he's not what I need anymore?

693
01:23:35,215 --> 01:23:37,248
What if you're what I'm looking for?

694
01:23:38,787 --> 01:23:40,599
That's not possible.

695
01:23:43,036 --> 01:23:44,576
I'm leaving you two.

696
01:23:45,884 --> 01:23:48,576
You know that I'm not here to stay.

697
01:23:50,036 --> 01:23:52,123
I'm going back to the States.

698
01:23:54,298 --> 01:23:56,303
You need each other more.

699
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:04,482
I just wanted to help,
and now I caused more complications.

700
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:07,803
You made everything clear.

701
01:24:32,737 --> 01:24:34,240
Marcus!

702
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:37,099
Marcus!

703
01:26:29,519 --> 01:26:32,340
Whenever each night reaches my thoughts,

704
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:37,106
times when we were still free

705
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:39,466
in each other's arms.

706
01:26:40,812 --> 01:26:44,949
As the warmth of our bodies combine...

707
01:26:45,828 --> 01:26:49,450
Each bead of sweat merge together...

708
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,597
Exchanging breaths...

709
01:26:52,635 --> 01:26:55,872
Each strand of our
hair brushing together...

710
01:26:56,975 --> 01:27:00,091
Reminders of the promise that you are mine,

711
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,989
and that I am yours.

712
01:27:06,948 --> 01:27:10,544
Slowly the cold truth pierces us,

713
01:27:12,466 --> 01:27:14,270
that all these thoughts

714
01:27:15,076 --> 01:27:17,481
are now just memories.

715
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,716
Always remembered

716
01:27:23,962 --> 01:27:26,395
but will never return.

717
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,958
Because you are here

718
01:27:35,568 --> 01:27:37,552
but not the kisses.

719
01:27:39,605 --> 01:27:40,731
You are here

720
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:46,638
but not the light in your eyes
that speak with each look.

721
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:50,340
You are here

722
01:27:51,946 --> 01:27:56,739
but not the love
that you used to give.

723
01:28:00,366 --> 01:28:01,513
You are here.

724
01:28:03,257 --> 01:28:05,130
But are you with me?

725
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:08,665
I love you,

726
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:11,685
but this time

727
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,270
let's set each other free.

728
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:25,053
- [cheering]
- Welcome back, Marcus!

729
01:28:39,395 --> 01:28:44,106
- [cheering]
- Welcome back, Marcus!

730
01:28:46,499 --> 01:28:49,231
How are you, sis?
Who are you looking for?

731
01:28:54,456 --> 01:28:59,599
We started from nothing.

732
01:28:59,624 --> 01:29:04,755
All was quiet, all was right.

733
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:12,075
Suddenly, everything changed.

734
01:29:12,602 --> 01:29:17,161
We are both lost.

735
01:29:22,116 --> 01:29:23,116
Hello.

736
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:26,613
I'm already here at the hotel.

737
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,740
Where are you?

738
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:35,700
Hey.

739
01:29:36,196 --> 01:29:37,196
How are you?

740
01:29:37,658 --> 01:29:39,880
I'm okay. You? How's life here?

741
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
It's okay.
