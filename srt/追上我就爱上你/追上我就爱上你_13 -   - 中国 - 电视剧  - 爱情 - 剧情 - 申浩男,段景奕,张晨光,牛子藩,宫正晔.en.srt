=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,640
Shen Nan...

3
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,630
I like you.

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,430
I really like you.

5
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,560
Whether it's Li Su

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,600
or Fang Chi,

7
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,240
I don't want you to be close to them.

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,920
You've really driven me crazy lately.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
You're driving me crazy,

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,120
you know?

11
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,030
Gu Yichen?

12
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,960
Gu Yichen!

13
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,910
Gu Yichen.

14
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,800
Are you listening to me?

15
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,750
Nothing.

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,990
I just want to tell you,

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,550
I'll skip training

18
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,390
for a while.

19
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,070
I have something else to do.

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,910
Skip training?

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
Gu Yichen, are you serious?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,070
We have races.

23
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,990
What is more important than training?

24
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm informing you.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,070
I'm not asking for your opinion.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,780
=Episode 13=
=Unspoken Love=

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,400
Bro, bro.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,360
My friends are crazy.

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,270
He asked me to kiss the next guest.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,680
Do you mind if I kiss you?

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,920
Why did you kiss me?

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,150
Don't take advantage of me.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,190
Are you crazy?

34
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,590
This...

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,550
What's wrong with him?

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,430
Weirdo, what a psycho.

37
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,430
Let's go ahead.

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,400
It's too awkward.

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,480
I told you not to play such pranks.

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,660
(To Shen Yi)

41
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,020
(Dear Shen Yi, see you
at Rong Restaurant tomorrow.)

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,920
(It's for Shen Yi.)

43
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,750
(But no one here knows)

44
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,960
(I'm Shen Yi.)

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
(It must be a surprise)

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
(Sister Li Su prepared for me.)

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,150
Fang Chi?

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
Why is it you?

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
Beautiful girl,

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm so glad

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
that you came.

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,320
Wait...

53
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,800
Where's Sister Li Su?

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,120
Didn't she ask me out?

55
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,990
You...

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,960
How did you find out...

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
You're a girl?

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,520
I overheard it in the locker room

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,960
by accident.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,310
But I

61
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,830
didn't know how to tell you,

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
so I...

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,190
- Then...
- I promise

64
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,910
I won't tell anyone.

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,470
Take a seat.

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,150
Thank you.

67
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,870
Fang Chi,

68
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,120
you freaked me out.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,510
I got goosebumps.

70
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,470
Shen Yi.

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
Actually, I came here

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,240
to tell you something.

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
What is it?

74
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
Well...

75
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,200
What a coincidence.

76
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,710
Fang Chi?

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,240
Why are you here?

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,070
Didn't you say the slogan

79
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,120
was tacky?

80
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,800
I...

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,070
I have plans with someone.

82
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,800
Besides, I think their slogan

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,680
is quite down-to-earth.

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm not sure about that.

85
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,070
I also have plans with someone I like.

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,310
Hey, why are you blocking me?
Let me see.

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,310
Calm down.

88
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,190
You like girls?

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,200
Or what?

90
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,630
Well, I mean...

91
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,310
Do you have a girl you like?

92
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,910
Yes.

93
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,510
Dear Racing Driver,

94
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,070
sorry to keep you waiting.

95
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,240
Oh, no.

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
I just arrived.

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,070
Why are you dressed up?

98
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,510
I dressed up to see you.

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
Let me introduce.

100
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,750
This is Fang Chi,
my friend in the racing team.

101
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

102
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,560
This is my senior.

103
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
She's a top student.

104
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,190
Let's go.

105
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,510
I booked a table over there.

106
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,870
They look like...

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,840
a great match.

108
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,310
Well, Shen Yi.

109
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,390
Why don't we go somewhere else?

110
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,390
- I...
- No need.

111
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
He can only see his crush.

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,280
He won't notice me.

113
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,200

Fang Chi, stop it.

I'm a racing driver.

177
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,030
I'm an athlete.

Okay.

182
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,150

No.

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,240
