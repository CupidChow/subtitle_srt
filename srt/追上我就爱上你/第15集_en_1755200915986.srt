=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,830
I knew you wouldn't sleep at this hour.

3
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,390
You haven't eaten, right?

4
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000
Not hungry.

5
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,470
Not hungry?

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,800
Then have a drink with me.

7
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,350
Here.

8
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,400
I don't want it.

9
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,070
Just suit yourselves.

10
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,390
Look at you.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Well, even if

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,400
you didn't do well in the race,

13
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,400
do you have to be so upset?

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Because of Shen Nan?

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, it's been a few days

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,150
since he moved out.

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Wait, how did you know?

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
Did he tell you?

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,710
No.

20
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,710
Susu told me.

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,550
She mentioned it once.

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,430
What else could it be?

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,550
You must've argued.

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,480
I asked him to move back.

25
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,990
I just sent him a message.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
But he blocked me.

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,640
Look, he blocked you, right?

28
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,830
Give him a call.

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,750
Just ask him out for a meal

30
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,710
and some drinks.

31
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,710
You're both men.
It's not that complicated.

32
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,270
Stop talking nonsense.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,310
That's a terrible idea.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,310
How could Shen Nan...

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,360
How could Shen Nan...

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
answer this call?

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

38
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,670
What's wrong?

39
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,430
I want to treat you to a meal.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,750
You choose the time and place.

41
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,680
That's it?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Or what?

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,430
So, is that a yes

44
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,390
or no?

45
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,990
Let me think about it.

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,240
What do you want to eat?

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,710
Maybe...

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
hotpot.

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,520
This...

50
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,150
See?

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,870
I told you it was a bad idea.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,430
Did he reject you?

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
- He agreed.
- Agreed?

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Then why are you still upset?

55
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,550
He wants to eat Chongqing hotpot.

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,910
What's wrong with

57
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,870
hotpot?

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
I can't eat spicy food.

59
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,270
Listen,

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
if you can't

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
eat spicy food,

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,080
you should drink more,

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,310
and it won't taste spicy.

64
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,150
You're really smart, aren't you?

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,750
By the way,

66
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,710
I heard Sichuan people

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,030
don't like light flavor.

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,360
Don't order a double-flavor hotpot.

69
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
Get some drinks for me.

70
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,150
- Hurry.
- Okay.

71
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,620
=Episode 15=
=Hotpot Solves All=

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
Gentlemen, what kind of hotpot
would you like?

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
- Double-flavor.
- Spicy.

74
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,360
Double-flavor hotpot.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
He can't eat spicy food.

76
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,550
Sure.

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
Double-flavor hotpot!

78
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,470
By the way, waitress.

79
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,800
One bottle of Maotai

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,760
and a bottle of cola.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,310
Our store doesn't have
such fine Chinese spirits.

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,360
But we have Huangtai.

83
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,590
Huangtai?

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,760
Yes.

85
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,270
Maotai in the south,

86
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,480
Huangtai in the north.

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,990
Scholars drink Huangtai,

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,920
poets drink Liangzhou.

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,010
For Chinese spirits,

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,550
you choose Huangtai.

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,600
For red wine,

92
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
you choose Liangzhou.

93
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,600
You won't be disappointed.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
You won't resist it.

95
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,870
Once you taste it, you'll know.

96
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,830
Give it a try.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,390
Alright, then I'll have
a bottle of Huangtai.

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,640
Sure.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,280
Huangtai!

100
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,990
The waitress is quite interesting.

101
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,200
Shen Nan.

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,750
You haven't come back

103
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,950
these days.

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,120
Actually, I want to ask you something

105
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
today.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Ask me something?

107
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,790
What is it?

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
These days,

109
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,680
you've slept alone.

110
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,680
- Are you...
- Here you are.

111
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,080
Thanks.

112
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you trying to say?

113
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,240
I mean, you've lived alone
for a few days.

114
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,390
Aren't you lonely?

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,760
Why don't you...

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,630
Well, you can...

117
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,560
Cola.

118
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,520
Thanks.

119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,120
What is it?

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,430
I mean, maybe you can...

121
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,080
Just put it in the parcel locker for me.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
Thanks.

123
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,270
Gu Yichen.

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
What did you just say?

125
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,750
I just want to tell you

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,960
I've been bored

127
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,240
at night these days. I'm alone.

128
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,720
I just hope that you...

129
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
Be careful.

130
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,870
Here's the hotpot.

131
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,160
Sir,

132
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,280
what else do you need?

133
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
That was fast, right?

134
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,510
Thank you!

135
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,630
Five-star review, please!

136
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,910
Please wait a moment.

137
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,310
It smells so good.

138
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,230
Nothing else.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,960
Let's eat.

140
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,320
Get your chopsticks.

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,320
Waitress.

142
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Where are the bowls?

143
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,950
Coming!

144
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,310
This placement is wrong.

145
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,080
Move it a bit. That's right.

146
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,150
Here you go.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,960
Thanks.

148
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,710
Don't be so polite.

149
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,860
(Zhang Sijin's Local Hotpot)

150
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,760
Come on, Shen Nan.

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,040
Why did you drink so much today?

152
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,390
This is cola.

153
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,600
If I got drunk,

154
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,800
it'd be embarrassing.

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
By the way, Gu Yichen,

156
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,390
you can drink a lot, right?

157
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,480
Surprised, huh?

158
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,710
Shen Nan.

159
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,390
Move a little

160
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,640
to the right.

161
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,150
What do you want?

162
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Just move.

163
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
I want to tell you something.

164
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,910
Do you know

165
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,080
why I drank so much today?

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,000
Why?

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Because I'm happy.

168
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
I can get drunk

169
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,760
even without the wine.

170
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,310
I'm so glad to have a meal

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,360
with you today.

172
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
Shen Nan.

173
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,390
Please move back.

174
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
Gu Yichen,

175
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
you...

176
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,560
You're drunk.

177
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
I'm not drunk.

178
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm begging you.

179
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
Please move back.

180
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,910
Please move back!

181
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
I'm begging you.

182
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,710
Gu Yichen.

183
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,240
Gu Yichen, get up.

184
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,750
Don't try to trick me
into taking you home.

185
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,750
Don't move.

186
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,910
Let me lean on you.

187
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,480
Gu Yichen.

188
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,670
You're drunk,

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
and I have to bring you back.

190
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,790
Are you serious?

191
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,390
Oh, god.

192
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,990
I'm so unlucky today.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,840
- What's wrong?
- Why are you so heavy?

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,750
Shen Nan!

195
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,000
What's going on?

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,270
Help him inside.

197
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,750
I can handle it.

198
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,870
Is he drunk?

199
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,510
- Come on.
- Let's go.

200
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,890
Come on.

201
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,630
Come on, lift your hand.

202
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,030
- Come on.
- It's okay, Fang Chi.

203
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,630
Go back and rest.

204
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,710
I'll take care of him.

205
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,870
Hey...

206
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,750
We've arrived...

207
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,710
We've arrived.

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,320
You're heavy.

209
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,150
Shen Nan...

210
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,350
Shen Nan...

211
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,480
I really like you.

212
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,990
I like you so much.

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I want to treat you

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,480
like my roommate.

215
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
But I've realized

216
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,790
I just can't do it.

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
Shen Nan...

218
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,670
You've occupied my mind.

219
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,910
You've occupied my heart.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,390
What should I do?

221
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,960
I wish you were a girl.

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Shen Nan...

223
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Gu Yichen...

224
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,270
Actually...

225
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,790
