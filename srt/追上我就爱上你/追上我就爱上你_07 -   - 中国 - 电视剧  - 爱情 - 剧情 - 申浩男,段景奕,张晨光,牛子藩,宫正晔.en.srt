Gu Yichen, are you okay?

00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,830
I'm fine.

4
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,080
Thanks.

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
Shen Nan,

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
don't worry.

7
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,080
I'm fine.

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,800
Gu Yichen,

9
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,430
I don't know

10
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,520
what's been bothering you.

11
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
But please remember,

12
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,590
we're a team.

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,270
Don't worry.

18
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,550
I'm really okay.

for relaxing with me.

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,300
You lost the game earlier.

115
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,100
You promised to grant my request.

116
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,380
Don't back out.

117
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,500
Really?

118
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
I don't remember saying that.

119
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,820

You swore

122
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,260
to grant me one request.

123
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,300
Now you're denying it.

124
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,540
You're better than this, no?

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,900
Fine.

126
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,740

Have you ever thought
about how much trouble

137
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,260
you'll cause

138
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,860
if someone finds out you're a girl?

139
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,340
I know I was wrong, Sister Li Su.

140
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,300
Sister Li Su,

141
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,860
please don't be mad, okay?

142
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,740
I'm begging you.

143
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,260
Please forgive me.

you've worked hard lately.

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,340
it hurts me.

152
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,620
It's my fault

153
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,540
for making you suffer.

154
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,740
Sister Li Su,

155
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,260
don't say that.

physical fitness.

162
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,060
Because I'm a girl,

163
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,500
I've had to face many obstacles,

164
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,860
and no club was willing

165
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,340
to give me a chance

166
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,500
to race alongside

male drivers.

168
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,460
I wanted to race,

169
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,220
but I

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,980
couldn't afford

171
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,500
the high training fees.

172
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,260
Now

173
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,580
I'm actually training in a club.

174
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,850
That's a big deal

175
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,260
to me.

176
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,380
