2
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,710
Tell us.

3
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,310
Which club poached you?

4
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,270
How much did they pay?

5
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,750
No one.

6
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,680
I just thought about it.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
I think I should

8
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,070
train abroad for a few years

9
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,600
and start over.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Stop lying.

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,160
Do you take me for a fool?

12
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,870
Explain everything to me,

13
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,600
or I won't let you
walk out of this room!

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
Is it...

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,160
because of Shen Nan?

16
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,230
Who did this?

17
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,190
I don't know.

18
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,150
I don't want to drag him into this.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,990
He's a great driver.

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,800
And I really care about him.

21
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,270
I can't ruin his career.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
But Shen Nan...

23
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,700
=Episode 19=
=Leave to Better Protect You=

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,430
Why did he drop out?

25
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,590
The City Championship

26
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,750
is about to start.

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,120
What's going on?

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,080
(Press Conference)

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,040
Gu Yichen,

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,680
the City Championship is coming up.

31
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,680
Did you drop out

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,270
because your mental illness relapsed?

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,750
Is it because of

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,480
the multiple-car pileup?

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
Will you be able to

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,990
get back on the track again?

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,990
Gu Yichen, please answer us.

38
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,120
Gu Yichen,

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
I heard about the romantic affair
between you and

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,190
Changgu's driver No. 2.

41
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,830
Did you drop out because of him?

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
Romantic affair?

43
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,150
Romantic affair?

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
This is mind-blowing.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
I can't believe it.

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,870
That's true.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,760
This...

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,240
Isn't this Shen Nan?

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,870
What's going on?

50
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,120
What's going on?

51
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,360
Why is he wearing women's clothes?

52
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,150
What's going on?

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,710
Shen Nan...

54
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,800
Why is he wearing women's clothes?

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,480
Why is he wearing women's clothes?

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,430
I'm Shen Nan's twin sister,

57
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,390
Shen Yi.

58
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,400
Shen Yi?

59
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,550
This...

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,080
I've been posing as my brother

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,750
to accept training
in Changgu Racing Team.

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,990
Is there a problem?

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
Come on!

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,030
Excuse me, why did you

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,910
join Changgu Racing Team

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,870
for your brother?

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,360
Is this deception?

68
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,120
Does Changgu Racing Team know

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,310
you're not Shen Nan?

70
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,400
Dear press friends,

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,430
please stay calm.

72
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,190
What Shen Yi said

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,710
might have caused some confusion.

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,950
Let me explain.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,630
Shen Yi was the person

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,190
Changgu Racing Team signed.

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,950
Half a year ago,

78
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,390
Shen Nan came to me

79
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,480
with her training records.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,240
To help his sister
fulfill her racing dream,

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,040
he voluntarily gave his spot

82
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,390
to Shen Yi.

83
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,430
Is that true?

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
All along,

85
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,830
car racing has been

86
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,720
dominated by men.

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,270
Racing teams rarely

88
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,310
provide women with

89
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,920
the same training resources

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,990
and opportunities.

91
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
However, I saw the bravery

92
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,000
and determination

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,870
of female athletes

94
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,120
in Shen Yi,

95
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,000
so the Changgu Racing Team

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,070
decided to work with her

97
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,040
to compete for the world championship.

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
Great!

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,990
- Great!
- Great!

100
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,710
Seriously?

101
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,040
You already knew, right?

102
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,680
Well, Fu Chuan just found out.

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,350
- Right?
- I just found out.

104
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,270
What are you going to do?

105
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,710
I don't know.

106
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,150
I'm also bewildered.

107
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,480
We can't let people find out

108
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,830
Shen Nan is actually...

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Shen Nan is actually a girl,

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
right?

111
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,510
Shen Nan is a girl?

112
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,470
Shut up.

113
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,550
When did you find out?

114
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,040
I knew it a long time ago.

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
Is Shen Nan really a girl?

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,430
Let's tell Shen Nan everything.

117
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,390
It's their business.

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,990
They should be the ones to decide.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
How could Shen Nan be a girl?

120
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,990
Shut up.

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
Everyone on the team

122
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,750
knew she is a girl except me.

123
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,760
Do you think it's funny?

(Press Conference)

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,320
Shen Nan.

126
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,880
Shen Yi.

127
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,590
You have deceived me

128
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,640
for such a long time.

you are a girl.

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,180
Is it interesting?

172
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,790
You treated me like an idiot.

Seeing me in pain,

176
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,480
are you satisfied now?

Gu Yichen,

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
What are talking about?

179
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,670
I don't understand.

180
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't understand.

181
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,830
Do you think I'm the type

182
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,990
who won't keep your secret?

183
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,270
- No...
- Do you really think

184
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm that unreliable?

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,990
It's not like that.

186
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,630

188
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,230
What am I doing?

189
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,570
Like you.

190
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,010

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Well,

192
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,440
are you scared?

193
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,790
If you're scared, stop
