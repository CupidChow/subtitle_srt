00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,340
(Enjoy Love)

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,160
If you love her,

4
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,040
take her to Rong Restaurant.

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,630
Enjoy your romance.

6
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,070
That's so tacky.

7
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,520
Yes, it's tacky.

8
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,350
Who would go to such a place?

9
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,960
I don't know what to say.

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Hey, what's the matter?

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
You're not saying anything.

12
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,070
If you don't tell me, I'm leaving.

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,880
Here's the thing.

14
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,070
I have a friend

15
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,200
who's been close

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,350
to a guy lately.

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,990
They train together

18
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,280
and meet every day.

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
She also did him

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
a small favor.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
This guy has been good to her.

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
So my friend

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,030
thinks...

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,030
she has some feelings

25
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,030
for this guy,

26
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,520
and he's special to her.

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,630
But she's not sure if this guy

28
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,680
also has

29
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,030
feelings for her.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Anyway...

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,470
It's complicated.

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,310
You probably don't get it.

33
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,280
Wait, aren't you talking about

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,430
Gu Yichen and you?

35
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,710
You...

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,710
How do you know?

37
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,920
Isn't this obvious?

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
So, how far

39
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,200
have you gone?

40
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,200
Well...

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,240
We kissed by accident.

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,590
Already kissed?

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,270
He took the initiative?

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
Wait a minute.

45
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,240
He thinks you're Shen Nan.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,240
You took the initiative?

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,670
Oh, no.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,550
It's not like

49
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,480
who took the initiative.

50
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,830
Anyway,

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,800
we just kissed.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,630
Wait.

53
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,710
You two kissed each other

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,800
by accident?

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,710
Do you think this is an idol drama?

56
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,630
Come on, tell me.

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,870
What really happened?

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,710
Well, that day,

59
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,520
when we were
fighting over something,

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
we kissed by accident.

61
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,430
I don't know

62
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,200
how we ended up like this.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,920
So, are you really

64
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,550
in love with Gu Yichen?

65
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,870
What are you talking about,
Sister Li Su?

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,430
Oh, well, stop pretending it.

67
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,870
Look at yourself.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,240
Can you really hide it?

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,150
I'm not in love.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
I just feel...

71
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,920
I just feel that he's a bit...

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,480
different.

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,550
Different?

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,710
You can only

75
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,680
fool yourself by saying that.

76
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,390
Yes.

77
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm fooling myself.

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,070
I'm Shen Nan,

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
not Shen Yi.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,760
Shen Yi.

81
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,040
You must be clear

82
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,030
about the situation.

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,750
You impersonated

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
your brother not just

85
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,430
to help him but yourself.

86
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,510
If you achieve good results,

87
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,750
you can prove to everyone

88
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,160
that women can also

89
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,920
have their place in racing.

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,990
But if you fail,

91
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,040
you'll be nobody.

92
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,800
You still won't

93
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,000
be accepted

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,040
by any club.

95
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
I get it, Sister Li Su.

96
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,390
Shen Yi.

97
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,750
It's okay for you

98
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,800
to date Gu Yichen.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
But you must know

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,240
what you really want

101
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,390
and what the most important thing is.

102
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,190
A girl

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
must prioritize herself.

104
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,790

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,080
I made small rice dumplings for you.

142
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,240
You made delicious food again.

143
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,920

I heard Coach Yu

155
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
punished you today.

156
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,680
Don't mention it.

157
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm exhausted.

158
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,120
It feels like my body was broken

159
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,320
into pieces and then reassembled.

160
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
You don't need to rush.

161
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,750
You can't make progress

162
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,080
in physical training overnight.

163
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,030

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,910
What?

166
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,870
Don't move.

167
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
(I can understand why you like Li Su.)

168
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,240
(Fang Chi?)

169
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,150
(Shen Nan, oh, Shen Nan,)

170

(gender doesn't matter, huh?)

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,400
What are you doing?

172
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
It's none of your business.

173
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,710
Wait, are you crazy?

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,270
I said, it's none of your business!

175
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Can't you two talk nicely?

176
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,840
I need to talk to you.

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,030
I also need to talk to her.

178
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,910
Gu Yichen.

179
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,840
You can

180
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
say it right here.

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,320
Are you sure about it?

182
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,790
Hey, he...

183
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,750
I'll check on him.

184
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,600
Shen Nan...

185
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,470
Wait.

186
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,230
Rice dumplings...

187
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,920
What a waste.

188
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,510
Gu Yichen, there's no one else now.

189
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,560
Can you speak?

190
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,830
Gu Yichen,

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
do you know you really looked

192
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,480
terrifying just now?

193
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,790
Why can't you talk nicely?

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We're all teammates.

195
