=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,760
(He was so bothered
by my comment yesterday)

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,940
(about female racing drivers.)

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,430
(Is Shen Nan a girl?)

5
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
(He's been training like crazy.)

6
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,190
Luckily, he hasn't started yet.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,040
If he keeps this up,

8
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,430
he'll destroy himself.

9
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,350
That's crazy.

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,660
Do you really want to destroy yourself?

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,150
None of your business.

12
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,270
I won't lose to a man...

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,270
I won't lose to a man like you.

14
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,430
Shen Nan,

15
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,680
be rational. Calm down, alright?

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,520
How am I being irrational?

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
If my training isn't

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
up to standard,

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,950
Coach Yu won't let me compete.

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,630
Every race in the City Grand Prix

21
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,870
matters to me.

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,120
So you'll be able to compete

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,130
if you train yourself to death?

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
I know what to do.

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,910
I'll train with you.

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,300
Better to fight together

27
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,100
than watch you wear out.

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,980
After all,
I've trained abroad for so long.

29
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,060
I can give you

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,020

Go to bed early.

64
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,180
Shen Nan.

65
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,980
Don't be nervous.

66
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,460
You'll pass

67
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,820
tomorrow's test.

68
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,140

=Fight On, Move Toward the Goal=

69
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,820
Today's significance

70
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,860
is clear to everyone.

71
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,380
Time to separate the wheat

72
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,940
from the chaff.

73
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,180
I'll say it again.

74
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,500
Show your best skills.

75
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,340
Pass the test,

76
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,780
and you race.

77
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,820
Fail?

78
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,140
Pack up and go home.

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,420
Understood?

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,660
Understood!

81
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,580
Come on.

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,220

83
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,620
passed the test.

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,420

Mao Mao.

87
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,940
Shen Nan.

88
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,460
That's great!

89
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,460
I made it!

90
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,940
You did it. I knew you could.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,060
Congratulations!

92
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,420
- Sister Li Su!
- Congrats!

93
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,300
I knew you could do it.

94
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,340
Congrats!

95
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,500
Alright.

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,220
Congrats!

97
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,740
Congrats.

98
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,420
Keep it up!

99
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,380
Sister Li Su.

100
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,340
We need to celebrate.

101
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,300
Let's go!

102
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,740
Alright, let's go.

103
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,700
- Great!
- Great!

104
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,340
Good job.

105
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,380
(Shen Nan)

106
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,460
What do you think?

107
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,860
This is our race car for the season.

108
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,740
Come on, our genius engineer.

109
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,380
Show us your masterpiece.

110
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,100
This one is

111
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,660
my special design

112
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,980
for urban tracks.

113
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,100
It's with max power

114
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,940
and peak specs.

115
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,700
But...

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,260
to maintain the car's stability,

117
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
the chassis height needs adjustment.

118
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,820
The rear wing also needs tweaking.

119
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,780
Yes.

120
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,780
So,

121
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,140
which one of you wants to test?

122
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,100
I'll do it.

123
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,100
Zhang Yang.

124
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,460
Mr. Shang,

125
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,420
hello there.

126
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
Welcome to Changgu Racing Team.

127
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Please let me show around.

128
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,140
And you are...?

129
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,740
Team Manager Li Su.

130
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,380
I've heard so much about you.

131
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,180
No need to trouble you.

132
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm just here to see my brother.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,490
- What are you doing?
- This junk car

134
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,700
is not worth testing.

135
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,780
You're the mechanic?

136
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,540
Is your car crash-resistant?

137
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,100
After all, Gu is so good

138
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,340
at car accidents.

139
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,140
What

140
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,220
a legend.

141
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,900
State your business. Skip the car.

142
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,020
Why are you so nervous?

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,740
I'm truly here

144
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,140
to help test your car.

145
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,180
- So ungrateful.
- Calm down.

146
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,940
Mr. Shang,

147
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,340
I heard you signed Zhang Yang

148
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,940
to Dayuan Racing Team.

149
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,380
It looks like

150
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,820
their standards

151
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,980
have slipped.

152
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,990
- What do you mean?
- Zhang Yang!

153
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,660
Ms. Li Su,

154
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,140
you're really joking.

155
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,540
I just came to see my brother.

156
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,220
Yichen,

157
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,940
Grandpa and I

158
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,900
miss you so much.

159
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,040
Especially Grandpa,

160
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,220
he's always talking about you.

161
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,980
You should come home more often.

162
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,340
I know, Brother.

163
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,900
As for Zhang Yang,

164
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,460
it's true that he's working
for Dayuan Racing Team.

165
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,140
He's an excellent racer

166
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,900
and his leg is almost healed.

167
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,340
It would be a pity

168
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,580
if he loses his career

169
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,380
just because of his injury.

170
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,620
What's more,

171
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,180
his injury is because of you.

172
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
You won't mind if I sign him

173
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,340
to our team, right?

174
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Of course not.

175
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,300
Alright.

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,260
That's good.

177
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,540
Good luck in the race.

178
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm taking my leave.

179
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
Okay, Mr. Shang.

180
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Then I won't see you off.

181
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,940
Let's go.

182
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,820
Be careful in the new season.

183
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,740
I'll always

184
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,380
keep an eye on you.

185
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,980
Gu Yichen,

186
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,340
are you okay?

187
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,900
Gu Yichen had

188
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,580
a serious accident

189
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,980
at the start of the race,

190
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,340
resulting in a multi-car collision.

191
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,420
Zhang Yang was
one of the racing drivers.

192
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,020
After the accident,
he was seriously injured

193
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,180
and could no longer withstand

194
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,620
the intense driver training,

195
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,250
leading to his removal from the team.

196
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,260
I didn't expect

197
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,180
Shang Yijiang

198
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,020
to sign him into Dayuan Racing Team now.

199
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,220
It seemed like the intention was clear.

200
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
They intend to use him

201
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,100
to deal with Gu Yichen.

202
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Shang Yijiang against Gu Yichen?

203
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,180
Sister Li Su,

204
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,620
aren't they brothers?

205
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,980
How could this happen?

206
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,940
It's a long story.

207
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,900
They don't share the same mother.

208
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,620
Besides, after the last accident,

209
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,460
Gu Yichen was left traumatized.

210
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,000
Furthermore, Zhang Yang came

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,120
every now and then
to remind him of his past mistakes.

212
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,380
Over the past six months,

213
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,180
he's been very unstable.

214
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,500
But don't worry too much.

215
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,420
He's already undergoing psychotherapy

216
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,380
and will get better.

217
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,020
However,

218
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,700
you have to prepare yourself in advance.

219
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,460
Maybe only you

220
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,860
will make it.

221
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,820
My teammate is still working hard

222
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,100
and I believe in him.

223
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,140
We can definitely fight together.

224
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,700
At first,
when Dayuan Racing Team approached me,

225
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,450
I thought
it was the Chairman's grandson,

226
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,100
Gu Yichen, who was up to something.

227
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,180
I didn't realize...

228
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,260
I didn't realize it was you

229
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,300
who wanted to use me...

230
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,300
I didn't say that.

231
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,860
I signed you

232
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,180
because of your racing skills.

233
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,740
Come on.

234
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,180
Do you really believe that?

235
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,860
But don't worry.

236
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,500
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

237
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,260
I promise,

238
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,780
if he dares to race,

239
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,820
I'll make him

240
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,980
