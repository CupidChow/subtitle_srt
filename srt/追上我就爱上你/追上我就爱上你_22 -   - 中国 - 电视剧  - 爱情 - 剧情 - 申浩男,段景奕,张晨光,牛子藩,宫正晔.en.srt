Okay.

36
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,400
Look at them.

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,430
They were on the outs yesterday,

and now they're all lovey-dovey.

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,460
I'm speechless.

40
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,310
That's right.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
They look so happy.

42
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,190
When will

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,800
my love flower bloom?

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
If you want it to bloom,

45
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,470
you need to be patient enough

46
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
to take care of her.

47
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,070
It also requires enough sunshine,

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
water,

49
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,770
and energy.

50
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,390
Enough energy?

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
What does that mean?

52
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,880
Why didn't you ask me

53
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,800
how I responded to Fang Chi?

54
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,200
You must've told him

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,190
you could only be friends

56
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200
because you already got me.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,060
You're so confident, aren't you?

58
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,580
That's not true.

59
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm not confident in myself

60
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,100
but in you.

61
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,140
Sweet talker.

62
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,300
It seems

63
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,460
you'll occupy

64
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,420
my entire world.

I'll repay you with my world.

67
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,940
Only you.

68
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,580
No one else.

69
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,900
Gu Yichen,

70
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,380
I really love you.

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,340
I love you too.

72
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,220
And I love you

73
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,180
more than you love me.

74
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
Why?

75
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,500
Because I love the way you are,

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,940
whatever it is.

(Operating)

79
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,540
(Even god is on my side.)

80
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,420
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,460
- Mr. Gu.
- Auntie Sun.

82
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,700
How is Grandpa right now?

83
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,300
Mr. Gu, you're finally here.

84
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
It's all my fault!

85
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,020
Chairman has a heart disease,

86
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,230
but I wouldn't dare to

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,420
tell you about his condition

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,740
without his permission.

89
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,300
It's all my fault!

90
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
- How could this happen?
- It's my fault.

91
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,820
Yichen.

92
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,980
Don't worry too much.

93
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,660
Grandpa is still in surgery.

94
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,940
But I found the best doctor.

95
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,640
He will be fine.

96
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,180
The board has something urgent.

97
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,540
I have to go.

98
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,250
Thank you so much.

99
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
I really appreciate it.

100
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,460
Especially, Mr. Chen, thank you

101
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,580
for blocking the information
about my grandpa.

102
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,180
Otherwise,

103
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,290
the situation

104
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,460
of Dayuan Group might get worse.

105
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,060
Mr. Shang,

106
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,250
you're too kind.

107
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,310
This is what we should do.

108
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,780
If we didn't block the media

109
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,160
but let them report recklessly,

110
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,540
the stock price

111
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,820
would drop,

112
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,580
and we'd be in big trouble.

113
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,620
Mr. Shang,

114
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
don't be so polite with us.

115
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,460
Your grandfather

116
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,530
and we built

117
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Dayuan Auto together.

118
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,660
How could we stand by?

119
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,580
Okay.

120
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,900
Then I will get to

121
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,180
the point.

122
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,820
My grandpa is ill,

123
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,660
and we don't know when he'll wake up,

124
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,460
but there must be a chairman.

125
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,220
So we must activate

126
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,540
the emergency regulations

127
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,900
and hold a board meeting

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,540
to elect a new chairman.

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,980
At tomorrow's board meeting,

130
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,020
I hope you can support me

131
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,740
and vote for me.

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,780
I definitely won't

133
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
let you down.

134
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,620
What do you think?

135
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
We're all aware of

136
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,180
your ability.

137
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,380
Currently, Dayuan Group

138
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,380
needs a leader

139
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,500
with vision and courage.

140
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,380
I support Mr. Shang
becoming the new chairman.

141
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
Right now,

142
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,420
the chairman

143
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,060
is in hospital.

144
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,260
With you managing everything,

145
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,900
I don't think anything

146
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,620
will go wrong for now.

147
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,780
In my opinion,

148
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,540
maybe we should

149
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
postpone the election

150
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,860
until the chairman recovers...

151
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,300
To be honest, I know

152
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,220
what you're thinking.

153
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,300
You know

154
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,100
my grandpa wants my brother
to take over the company.

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,060
Therefore, you're afraid

156
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,620
if I become the chairman,

157
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,960
Grandpa will blame you

158
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
when he wakes up.

159
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,660
Have you thought about this?

160
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,140
First, my brother Gu Yichen

161
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,620
is focused on racing

162
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,740
and only wants to be
a professional driver.

163
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,460
He has never and can't

164
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,220
manage the group.

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Moreover, now he's

166
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,780
still working for our rival,

167
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,340
Changgu Racing Team.

168
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,300
Well, even if he returns,

169
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,100
will he prioritize Dayuan Group's

170
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,260
interests?

171
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,060
Second,

172
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,420
Grandpa's illness

173
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,460
is really serious

174
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,780
this time.

175
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,300
I've consulted

176
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,140
many renowned experts.

177
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,100
However,

178
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,020
maybe he won't make it.

179
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,140
This is a critical time

180
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,540
for Dayuan Group's survival.

181
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,540
I hope you can make the right choice

182
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,060
for the future of Dayuan Group

183
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,900
and yourselves.

184
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,980
On the other hand,

185
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,500
if you don't take sides

186
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,700
or choose

187
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,100
the wrong side this time,

188
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,820
don't blame me for giving you

189
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,020
a hard time when I become

190
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,940
the chairman through other methods.

191
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,100
(Dayuan Group)

192
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,740
Gu Yichen.

193
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,620
How's your grandpa?

194
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,380
Grandpa...

195
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,260
It's not good.

196
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,300
Grandpa's coma news

197
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,620
has spread within the group.

198
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
They'll hold a board meeting

199
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,460
to elect a new chairman.

200
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,620
Shen Yi.

201
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,740
I have to go back for Grandpa.

202
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,300
As for the press conference...

203
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,700
Just go back.

204
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
I can handle it.

205
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,780
Thank you.

206
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,340
By the way, Shen Yi,

207
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,780
I need to tell you

208
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
something.

209
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,140
Go ahead.

210
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,180
I'll try to make it back
before the race.

211
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,940
But if

212
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,820
something goes wrong with the group,

213
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,020
I might...

214
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,780
Nothing will go wrong.

215
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,580
I will wait for you to return.

216
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,500
When you're back,

217
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,620
we'll win

218
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,820
the championship we deserve.

219
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,540
If you win, I'll also win.

220
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,340
Whether I make it back or not,

221
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,620
you can't give up.

222
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,180
I don't want you

223
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,260
to have any regrets

224
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,220
