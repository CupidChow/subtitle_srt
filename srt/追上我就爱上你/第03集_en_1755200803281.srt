=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,260
Mr. Shang,

3
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,900
this is the annual plan you made.

4
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,460
Most of the board members agreed.

5
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,380
A few still have doubts.

6
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,740
However,

7
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
as for the chairman's approval...

8
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,020
Didn't he approve it?

9
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,660
- He didn't...
- Does he think

10
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,060
I didn't manage Dayuan Group well?

11
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,740
All the group's achievements

12
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,860
are from my

13
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
hard work.

14
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,900
But that old man still wants

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,420
Gu Yichen to lead the group.

16
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,740
After all, my surname is Shang,

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,220
and he's a Gu.

18
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,420
(Fifteen Years Ago)

19
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,380
Chairman,

20
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,220
it's all my fault.

21
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,260
(Shang Li, Yijiang's Mother)

22
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,140
But my son is innocent!

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,340
I hope

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,980
you can accept us,

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,260
no matter for what reasons.

26
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,940
All these years,

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,020
I've turned a blind eye

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,420
to the relationship
between you and Qizhang.

29
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,820
Now that Qizhang is gone,

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,700
you...

31
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,700
(Younger Shang Yijiang)

32
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,660
Your son can stay,

33
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,860
but you must leave.

34
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,220
Chairman,

35
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,580
since I became Qizhang's secretary,

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,060
I have loved him and

37
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
taken care of him in every aspect.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,980
It was you!

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,860
For the group's benefit,

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,300
you forced him to marry
someone he didn't love.

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,620
Did I really do it for my benefit,

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,140
or were you up to no good?

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,700
Chairman...

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,820
Just go.

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,700
Remember what I told you.

46
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,340
(Younger Gu Yichen)

47
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,780
Check Zhang Yang's transfer info.

48
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,740
Zhang Yang?

49
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,380
That crazy driver?

50
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,340
But he's been notorious
for deliberately harming

51
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,980
other drivers.

52
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,420
Yes, it's him.

53
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,500
Let him join Dayuan Racing Team

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,860
and compete in this race,

55
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,140
whatever it takes.

56
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,300
Okay.

57
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,540
I'll handle it now.

58
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,180
Wait.

59
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Keep an eye on Gu Yichen.

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,540
If you find anything,

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,020
report to me immediately.

62
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,220
Okay.

63
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,540
=Episode 3=
=A Bit of Affection for Him=

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,460
Hello, guys.

65
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,580
Hello, Coach.

66
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,940
My name is Yu Yue,

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,900
same surname as Yu Qian.

68
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,500
Nice to meet you all.

69
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
But first, I want to congratulate you.

70
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,980
You're quite lucky

71
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,260
to have joined Changgu Racing Team.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,420
But I need to remind you that

73
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,380
if you fail in the physical test,

74
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,620
don't even think about

75
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,020
driving a car.

76
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
Do you understand?

77
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,380
Understand.

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,420
Gu Yichen, Shen Nan, step forward.

79
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,580
I believe

80
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
you all know them.

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,900
From now on,

82
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,380
they'll be your rivals.

83
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,500
If you can perform

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,860
better than they do

85
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,300
in the training,

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,780
you can

87
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,180
replace them.

88
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,260
Racing doesn't just look cool.

89
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,220
It requires stamina.

90
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,500
You must give it all you've got.

91
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,500
Once the car starts,

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,540
the strong recoil

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,140
will press you down.

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,780
Therefore, you must have

95
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,100
a strong body

96
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,980
to resist the recoil.

97
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,300
Only then

98
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,420
can you move on

99
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,860
to the next phase.

Mr. Shang...

107

Zhang Yang still wouldn't

108
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,060
accept our offer.

109
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,420
Then give him an offer

110

113
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,780

(wouldn't that be great?)

120
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,540

Hey, Gu Yichen.

123
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,500
You're a grown-up man.
Can you dress properly?

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,340
So, you know I'm a grown-up man.

125
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,300
Well, we're both men.
What are you afraid of?

126
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Look at you.

127
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,220
You wear a sweatshirt
and trousers in summer.

128
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,180
Don't you feel hot?

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,460
None of your business.

130
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,140
I can wear whatever I like.

131
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I just can't...

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,900
Gu Yichen, are you crazy?

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,180

134
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,260

136
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,980

Hey, the AC is still on.

138
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,340

I can't stand the smell.

140
