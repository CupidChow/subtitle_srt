00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,140
=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,670
Shen Nan,

3
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,590
how did you

4
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,910
get into racing?

5
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,080
Just because I like it.

6
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,040
The thrill of competition.

7
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,910
Just like it?

8
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,710
I thought you'd answer more sincerely.

9
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,600
What about you?

10
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,800
It's about choices.

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,760
Ever since I was a kid,

12
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,760
I've felt like

13
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,260
a lot of things
have been arranged for me.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
And my will was always dictated
by others.

15
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,070
Sometimes

16
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
I really envy my brother.

17
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,520
Maybe Grandpa kept him away
from the family

18
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,800
so he could choose freely.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,600
And sometimes

20
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,350
I feel like my father

21
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,760
is quite biased.

22
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,680
Privileged background.

23
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,120
But had no other choice.

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,390
Gu Yichen,

25
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,590
it sounds like

26
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,960
you're somewhat bragging.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
But I respect

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,870
that you chose to do

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,480
what you like,

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,480
just like me.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,710
Though

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,360
I sound pretentious too.

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
I just want to tell you,

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,480
don't worry about me.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Racing is my only choice.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,960
I'll stand my ground.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,430
On this track,

38
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,150
I won't back down.

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,680
I believe you, Gu Yichen.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm with you, too.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
We'll surely win together.

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,520
But

43
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,150
there's only one champion.

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,830
We're teammates

45
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,590
and rivals, who know each other best.

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,150
Don't be jealous

47
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,400
if I win the championship.

48
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,360
It's not decided yet.

49
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,820
=Episode 6=
=He Must Be Very Upset=

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
You woke up so early.

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
You're awake.

52
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,280
You were exhausted yesterday.

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,430
I made you some congee.

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Go wash up.

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,200
It's almost ready.

56
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,710
Shen Nan,

57
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,160
if you were a girl,

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,440
I'd marry you.

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Really?

60
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,770
Yes.

61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,030
What's up?

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,230
They're about to start the track training.

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
I came to check the data.

64
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,910
Come here.

65
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,120
You've been really tired lately, huh?

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,800
Yeah, a bit.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,880
Let me give you a massage.

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,280
Not bad.

69
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,680
Did you take lessons?

70
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Yeah, I tried to be versatile.

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
I can even read palms.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
Let me check yours.

73
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,870
Seriously?

74
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,830
Yes.

75
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,040
Do you think I'm lying?

76
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,870
Let me.

77
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,560
Enough?

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,520
No.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
No, I'm not...

80
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,990
I... I really know how to read palms.

81
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll read it for you.

82
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
You're missing someone in your life.

83
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
Come on, keep going.

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,880
Born in 2000.

85
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,310
He's an Aries.

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,270
And then?

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
He's lively and cheerful,

88
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,510
and quite handsome.

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,630
You're not talking about yourself,
are you?

90
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,830
His name is Fu Chuan.

91
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,830
Alright, enough jokes.

92
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,790
Get out now.

93
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,430
The training's starting soon.

94
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
Fine.

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,720
Take care of yourself.

96
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
Alright.

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
And

98
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
make sure to rest well.

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,830
Got it. Now leave.

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,790
Alright, I'm off.

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,440
Straight-line speed

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,270
isn't maximizing the car's potential.

103
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,430
With today's data,

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,280
you'll be dead last

105
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,360
in the City Grand Prix.

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,550
Gu Yichen, take a look.

107
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,780
Your braking points are off,

108
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,950
and cornering speed's a joke.

109
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,270
This isn't you.

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,040
Fix whatever is messing

111
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,510
with your head,

112
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,920
or quit now

113
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,140
and spare the shame.

114
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,500
But our two-car pit strategy worked.

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,460
We can recover...

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,900
Li Su,

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,940
give them some more time.

118
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,580
Take it easy.

119
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,980
Take it easy?

120
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,420
Sure,

121
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,180
with the first race is just days away.

122
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,220
The City Grand Prix includes 12 races.

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,100
It's ranked by points.

124
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Every race is crucial.

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,900
There is no time

126
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,940
for gradual teamwork,

127
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,900
got it?

128
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,540
Li Su,

129
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,500
I need to talk to you.

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,460
Stop training.

131
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,540
It's not a technical issue.

132
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,340
It's here.

133
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Sorry,

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,340
