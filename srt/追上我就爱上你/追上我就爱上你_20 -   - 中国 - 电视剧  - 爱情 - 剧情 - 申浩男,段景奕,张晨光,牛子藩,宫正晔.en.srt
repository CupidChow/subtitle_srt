2
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,120
Gu Yichen wouldn't

3
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,550
answer the calls. I couldn't find him.

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
I don't know

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,830
what's going on with him.

6
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,040
The final round is coming up.

7
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,800
He's driving me crazy.

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,960
I think he'll come back.

9
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,240
Racing is the most important

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,240
thing to him.

11
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,670
Shen Yi,

12
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,910
are you sure?

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,070
I'm really worried.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,240
I believe he will come back.

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,800
Gu Yichen!

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
Gu Yichen, where have you been?

17
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,230
The race is about to start,

18
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,190
okay?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,270
Do you want to compete or not?

20
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,340
=Episode 20=
=Broken Heart Syndrome=

21
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,870
Gu Yichen.

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
Come over here.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
I thought you wanted a fight.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,800
Well,

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,040
want to fight instead of

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
drinking with me?

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
Or do you want

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,550
to drink with Shen Yi

29
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
instead of me?

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Shen Yi.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
I can't get used to

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
this name.

33
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,240
Gu,

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
aren't you always

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,740
a smart

36
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,080
and arrogant man?

37
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,470
How did you get fooled around

38
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,520
by a girl?

39
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,360
You took me for a fool, right?

40
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,550
Was it fun?

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
I swear to god,

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,310
I never thought that.

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,520
Besides, only Li Su and I knew this

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,590
at the beginning.

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,960
How could I tell you?

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,000
Besides, I've already told you

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
Fu Chuan just found out.

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
Does it matter?

49
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,590
What's going on?

50
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,640
Yes, he came back.

51
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,990
But look at them.

52
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,110
How can they compete?

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,310
From now on,

54
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,870
we must ban office romances!

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,670
We must eliminate any situations

56
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,750
that'd affect the races.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,910
No.

58
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,870
What did you say?

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
I mean,

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,640
how can we stop something like this?

61
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,520
He thought Shen Yi was a boy.

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,710
I don't care.

63
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,680
If there's another office romance,

64
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,070
they'll lose their bonuses!

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,190
Well, if that's the case,

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
we'll both lose our bonuses.

67
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,230
Get out!

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,160
But don't deduct my bonus.

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
Calm down.

70
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,350
Get out!

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,680
Gu.

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
I've liked a girl

73
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,030
for a long time.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,480
But I've never
had the courage to tell her.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,680
I've watched her

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,720
train with another guy and get closer

77
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,430
to him every day.

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,480
I've seen her jealous and upset

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,630
because of him.

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,630
I've seen her in pain

81
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,750
because of him.

82
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,920
But there's nothing I can do.

83
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,360
I can only stay by her side

84
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,430
as a friend.

85
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,120
Do you mean Shen Yi?

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Yes.

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,320
I like her.

88
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,950
I fell in love with her at first sight.

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,080
What's wrong?

90
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,350
Are you scared

91
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
I'll steal her from you?

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,510
Listen,

93
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,950
if you keep pushing her away,

94
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,910
you might lose her.

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
Sometimes I really feel

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
you're so mean.

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,800
Didn't you know
she was a girl all along?

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,520
What do you mean?

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,800
You keep pushing her away

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
but don't allow others to like her, huh?

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
I've never pushed her away!

103
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,120
At first, we ate, lived,
and slept together.

104
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,240
I also had doubts about her gender.

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,990
But no one ever told me.

106
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,760
I also hoped to feel
the same way about her

107
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
like I felt about

108
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,320
other teammates.

109
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
I don't know

110
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,680
when I fell in love with her.

111
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm just confused.

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,870
Why did she

113
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,870
refuse to tell me

114
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,120
at the beginning?

115
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,390
Shen Yi, Shen Nan,

116
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,720
why aren't they the same person?

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Gu.

118
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,150
Look,

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
why are you confused?

120
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,120
No matter what she's called,

121
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,280
whether she has long or short hair,

122
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,510
whether she's male or female,

123
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,630
she's still herself.

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,120
Maybe you should ask yourself

125
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,870
what you would be like

126
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,390
if you lost her.

127
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,120
Gu, as your bro,

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,430
I think I should persuade you.

129
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,160
But as your opponent,

130
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,120
I'll tell Shen Yi I like her!

131
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,710
As for the rest,

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,320
it's up to her.

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
Actually...

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,630
Actually, I wanted
to tell you last time.

135
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
But...

136
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,670
Later, I thought about it
for a long time.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,160
Shen Yi,

138
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
I...

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,630
really, really like you.

140
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,710
Fang Chi.

141
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,040
Thank you.

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
I mean it.

143
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,270
I really appreciate it.

144
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,030
But you know...

145
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,200
- I know.
- I...

146
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,990
I know.

147
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
You like Gu, right?

148
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,920
Don't get me wrong.

149
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,270
Today, I only want

150
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,200
to express

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,360
my true feelings.

152
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm not asking for any promises.

153
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,560
Anyway, I just want you to know

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
as long as you're happy,

155
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm happy.

156
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,160
Come on.

157
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,870
Shen Yi.

158
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,720
Don't be too hard on yourself.

159
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,960
If you really think you made a mistake,

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,750
go back and apologize to him.

161
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,920
Don't worry.

162
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,750
If he doesn't forgive you,

163
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,080
you still have me, bro.
