1
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,480
Ningning, the child

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,200
It hasn't worried us much all the time

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,480
We haven't interfered much in her life either

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,720
As for what black baby, I don't know even more

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,120
And what else

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,720
And

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,680
What about this child? Actually

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,480
It's not my own

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,960
I adopted it from the welfare home

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,040
I told her when she grew up

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,120
What about her biological parents

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,360
This child is abandoned

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,160
Where are the biological parents

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,400
I don't know either

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,320
When you adopted her

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,720
Is that what she has

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,760
Right

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,560
She was very afraid of being alone since she was a child

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
Stay alone in the room

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,120
As long as I put her in my room

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,880
A person

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,360
She cried so hard

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,040
I didn't care too much at that time

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,480
I think the child is small

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,280
It's normal to be timid

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,800
It may be good to grow up

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,880
When I grew up, I found that she was still like that

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,800
We'll ask her what you're afraid of

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,240
She couldn't tell herself

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,400
I just said I forgot everything before I was abandoned

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,040
Liu Ningning

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,760
You gave it to her, didn't you

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,880
Right

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,320
My husband's last name is Liu

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,840
We want the child to have peace all his life

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,160
So she was named Liu Ningning

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,800
As for her name,

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
I don't know

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,120
I only know her nickname is little darling

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Which girl

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,240
That's the one

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,600
There is a female character in the mouth

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,240
That's right

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
If you want to know her name,

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,400
You can go to Dean Tian of the welfare home

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,360
She knows

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
The welfare home you said

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,880
Is it Chunguang Welfare Institute

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,600
Right

50
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Xiao Sun

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,880
You can sort out the transcripts again

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,800
Good

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,760
Hello

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,000
Come with me to Chunguang Welfare Institute

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,680
Lao Wang

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
I thought Luo team said to find similar cases

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,360
I have already said hello to the provincial office

58
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,440
They said they'd contact us if they found something

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,920
By the way, Brother Wang

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,280
The black rice porridge you asked for is gone

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,240
I changed one for you

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,800
I can do whatever I want

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
What's wrong, old iron

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,800
I forgot to lock the door last night

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
I locked it

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,320
Report

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
I was transferred from the provincial office

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,840
The new assistant of Luo team

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,760
Chen Jiaxin

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,320
How do you do

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,000
Hello brother

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,280
How do you do

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,160
Chen Jiaxin

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,480
How do you do

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,400
I've been here before when I'm familiar with it

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
Come and do legal popularization

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,000
Slow down

78
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,000
Be careful

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,600
Go over there a little bit

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,680
A little past

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,600
Slow down

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,480
Don't fall

83
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Be careful, be careful

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,720
Dean

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,280
Officer Luo has come to popularize the law again

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,320
Come and sit down

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,080
No

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,040
This is

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,280
The psychological counselor in the bureau

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,560
Dean

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,280
Come this time

92
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
I want to find out something about you

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,360
The girl in the photo

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,360
Do you remember

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,960
Her

96
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,000
Little darling

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,960
Clingy and cry

98
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
Don't like being alone

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
The biological parents of the little darling

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
I never found it

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,120
She was abandoned in Longzhou Park

102
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
It was the police station that sent her to our welfare home

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
But she's in our welfare home

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
I didn't stay long either

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,920
It's about a month

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,080
It was taken in by a local family

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Dean

108
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,680
Which specific police station

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Do you remember

110
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,920
Which police station

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
I really can't remember this

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,120
What about the others

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
It's like coming with her

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,120
There is also a letter

115
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,320
In the archives

116
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,200
Go

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,640
I'll show you to find it

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
Officer Lo

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
Please wait here first

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
Our reference room has only recently been renovated

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,920
This information is a bit messy

122
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,640
Haven't had time to sort it out yet

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,280
Officer Luo, look

124
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,960
This is the year 2002

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,640
Personal information of children entering the park

126
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,680
This is the little darling you said

127
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,560
Dean

128
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,720
You just said there was a letter, didn't you

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,680
Right

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Why not

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
I remember it clearly

132
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
It is glued to the file

133
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Why is it gone

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,480
Do you remember the contents of the letter

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,080
The content of the letter probably says

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,240
The biological mother of the little darling

137
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,920
Is a working girl from other places

138
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,760
When I was young, I was cheated by a man

139
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,600
Born out of wedlock and gave birth to a little darling

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
Then this man

141
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
Abandoned their mother and daughter

142
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,720
Gone forever

143
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,560
My mother is seriously ill

144
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
There is really no way to take care of her

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,360
I wrote a letter and put it beside her

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,200
Abandon her in the park

147
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,680
I went back to my hometown by myself

148
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,840
The letter says

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,360
The names of her biological parents

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
Names of biological parents

151
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Not mentioned

152
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,520
That woman is seriously ill

153
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,960
It is not clear whether it is in the world now

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,640
It was before this

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,000
It is estimated that only the children themselves know

156
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,920
OK, thank you

157
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Thank you, Dean

158
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Officer Lo

159
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Come over if you have anything to do

160
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
We tried our best to help

161
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,280
Good

162
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,280
Dean, I'm leaving

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,000
Bye bye

164
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,840
Walk slowly

165
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,400
Go away

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,000
Go away

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,320
Officer Lo

168
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,880
When I was working upstairs just now,

169
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,799
Looks like you

170
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,680
That's true

171
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,960
Investigate a case

172
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,440
Acquaintance

173
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,560
Lao Yang

174
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,800
Previously known by law popularization

175
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,880
Land breeze level

176
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
The psychological counselor in the bureau

177
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,880
How do you do

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,320
How do you do

179
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,200
Excuse me

180
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,280
My hands are covered with dirt

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Be fond of growing flowers

182
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,120
Right, right, right

183
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
I like it, too

184
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,680
Is it

185
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,480
I have raised several pots of Chinese roses. It's good

186
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,600
One person will give you a basin

187
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,280
Don't don't don't

188
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
I said I like it

189
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,360
But I've never been able to feed

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,240
Have another drink later

191
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
Long time no see

192
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,400
Then you can talk about it when the case is empty first

193
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,600
See you later

194
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Go away

195
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,560
Bye bye

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Walk slowly

197
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,160
Bye bye

198
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Bye bye

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,560
Luo Fei went to Chunguang Welfare Institute

200
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm afraid Luo Fei will find out

201
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,120
I have to get rid of the file quickly

202
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
No need

203
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,200
This time

204
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,880
I have a more suitable candidate

205
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,520
A good boss

206
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,480
Luo's team is good

207
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,840
Then what's the introduction?

208
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,480
Luo team

209
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,440
This is transferred by Lu Bureau from provincial offices

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
New colleague Chen Jiaxin

211
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,520
From the ministries and agencies

212
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,400
Chen Jiaxin

213
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,520
Get ready

214
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,240
The meeting will be held soon

215
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,600
Xiao Chen, right

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,480
Why don't you sit here

217
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,800
That's where I sit

218
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,200
Excuse me

219
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
I'm a counselor on the team

220
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,480
Land breeze level

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,400
Chen Jiaxin

222
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
Sit here after that

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,360
Good

224
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,320
Why did he just sit in Xiao Liu's position

225
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,280
Let's get started

226
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Six years ago

227
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,440
There was a murder in the provincial capital

228
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
The deceased was a woman

229
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,840
This case is the same as Gao Yongxiang's case

230
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,240
He also had his head and hands cut off

231
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,800
This is Chen Jiaxin

232
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,240
A detailed file brought from the provincial office

233
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
Next to this body

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
There are no relics

235
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,840
So at that time, the police had no way to find out

236
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
Identity information and social relations of the deceased

237
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,920
And die

238
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,480
It seems that

239
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,880
The killer is trying to hide the identity of the victim

240
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Although the clothes of the deceased were stripped naked,

241
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,000
But there's no sign of sexual assault

242
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
And through the comparison of the wound marks of the deceased, it was found that

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
This body

244
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,040
And the way Gao Yongxiang's body was cut

245
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,400
It is consistent with the method of strangling first and then dismembering the body

246
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,400
Same modus operandi

247
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
The wound is consistent again

248
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,280
Then I think the murderers of these two murders

249
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
It should be the same person

250
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,600
Headless body at the crime scene

251
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,840
Nothing more than these situations

252
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
Hide the identity of the deceased

253
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
Mask header information

254
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,640
Otherwise, the murderer wants to vent his emotions

255
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,560
Create an illusion

256
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,760
Affect the sight of the police

257
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,120
If these two

258
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,280
The murderer's motive has changed

259
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
Gao Yongxiang's case

260
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,040
The murderer had no purpose in hiding the identity of the deceased

261
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
But this case

262
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,520
The murderer hid the identity of the victim

263
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,320
Then the murderer can't be Liu Ningning

264
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,840
She didn't go to college six years ago

265
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,240
I don't know Gao Yongxiang at all

266
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Early tomorrow morning

267
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
Hypnotize Liu Ningning again

268
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,360
Only by unlocking this black baby

269
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,840
To remind her of the whole crime

270
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,000
You can try to take Longzhou Park as the breakthrough point

271
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,840
Adjourn a meeting

272
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,760
Sit down

273
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Sit down

274
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
Do you think everyone hasn't accepted you yet

275
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,600
Kind of

276
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,160
Is it because

277
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
Liu Dongping's predecessors are too good

278
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,040
I'm a little short of him

279
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,160
Think too much

280
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
Just now, the Luo team didn't take it personally

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,560
It's because you took Liu Dongping's seat

282
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,840
It is inevitable that he will remember the previous things

283
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,160
In fact, location is not important

284
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,840
The important thing is that you are now

285
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,160
We must integrate into this group as soon as possible

286
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,760
To try to make yourself

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
Understanding and Habit

288
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,880
Luo's

289
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,640
Style of doing things

290
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,920
I understand

291
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Thank you, Miss Lu

292
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,320
I can do it

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,680
Believe you

294
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,600
Just relax a little bit

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Go home

296
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,120
Ning Ning

297
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,000
Liu Ningning

298
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,960
Liu Ningning

299
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,040
Liu Ningning's family

300
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,240
Your fee is due

301
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,520
Remember to come and pay the fee

302
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,080
OK

303
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,600
I'll hand it in in a minute

304
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,840
Aunt

305
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Let Ningning go to bed early

306
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,120
Let's go out first

307
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
OK, thank you

308
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,200
Why can't I remember

309
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
According to the age at which she was adopted

310
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,280
She shouldn't fail to remember

311
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,680
Unless

312
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,880
It's not that she can't remember

313
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
It doesn't exist at all

314
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
Liu Ningning's Abandoned Park

315
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,680
It doesn't exist in her memory

316
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,040
Yeah

317
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,920
It's clearly recorded in the file

318
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,800
Then there is something wrong with the file

319
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,640
Come with me to the welfare home later

320
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,840
Mr. Bai

321
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,680
Thank you so much

322
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,720
With you here

323
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,880
Our welfare home will have a good time this day

324
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,320
So many new air conditioners have been added to us

325
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,240
Thank you so much

326
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,360
You're welcome, Dean

327
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
I also hope that the children

328
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,520
Can live a better life

329
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Thank you very much, Mr. Bai

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,600
Where where

331
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,120
Dean

332
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,520
How do you do, Officer Luo

333
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,960
In 2009, the reason why we

334
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,240
Can catch this gang selling hallucinogens

335
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,440
By an informant named Bai Yaxing

336
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,599
Information provided

337
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,079
Mr. Bai

338
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,480
You are

339
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,960
Longzhou Criminal Investigation Brigade Luo Fei

340
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,319
Land breeze level

341
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,640
The psychological counselor in the bureau

342
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,560
How do you do

343
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,000
What can I do for Officer Luo

344
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
I've been looking for you before

345
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
Want to know something

346
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,480
You are too busy to make an appointment

347
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,440
I didn't expect to meet here

348
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,160
Come to think of it

349
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
I'm really sorry, officer Luo

350
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
It was too busy at that time

351
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,440
Mr. Bai is here

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,920
Mr. Bai is coming

353
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,200
Is to fund a batch of air conditioners for us

354
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,480
The air conditioner in the welfare home

355
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,760
It's been some years

356
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,320
This is not Mr. Bai.

357
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,040
I came to send us a batch of air conditioners

358
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,560
Officer Lo

359
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,680
Do you want to find a place to sit later

360
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,160
Some other time

361
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
By the way, Dean

362
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,960
I want to go to the archives room again

363
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
Yes, I have the key

364
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,360
This is the key

365
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Officer Lo

366
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,840
This is my personal number

367
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,600
What can I do for you in the future

368
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Just make this call

369
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,960
I will cooperate with you as soon as possible

370
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
Mr. Bai, thank you very much

371
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,640
You see, the children have new air conditioners

372
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,960
This summer will be better

373
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,200
You can come here often in the future

374
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,440
Let me look for it for you

375
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Found Luo Fei

376
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,800
What's the matter

377
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,120
The file is wrong

378
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Be touched by someone

379
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,480
What do you mean by being moved

380
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,440
The last time I came to see it

381
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,320
It's not this boy behind her

382
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,600
Do you remember wrong

383
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,960
How could I remember wrong

384
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
No

385
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,520
Are you sure

386
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,680
Determine

387
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,040
The key to the archives

388
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,480
It is Dean Tian who keeps it alone

389
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,000
No one has ever been in the middle

390
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,080
And the archives

391
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,480
There's nothing of value

392
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,680
If you want to see the file,

393
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Just come to us directly

394
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,040
There's nothing to keep secret

395
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,120
Will the key be taken by someone

396
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,080
It won't

397
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Chairman Bai today

398
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
Come to the welfare home

399
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
Dean Tian has been very busy all morning

400
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,240
The key was only given to you

401
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
OK, thank you

402
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,240
To give you one

403
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,840
Have you said thank you yet

404
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,240
We just found Liu Ningning

405
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
No memory of the park

406
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,000
Someone sneaked into the archives

407
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
Moved the file

408
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,520
So you think

409
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,920
This matter

410
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,000
It has something to do with Liu Ningning's case

411
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
Before, we were on the file

412
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Seeing that Liu Ningning's life experience is false

413
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,080
Stolen

414
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
It's true

415
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,920
It's been half an hour

416
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,080
Haven't thought about what to eat yet

417
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,240
Except for the girl in the photo

418
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,560
I can't remember anything else

419
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,600
What

420
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,680
Forget it

421
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,480
How can you forget it

422
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,720
Say it if you want

423
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,800
I was thinking

424
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,640
Even if Dean Tian

425
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,160
Remember the origin of each child

426
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,320
Then first she needs to know who this child is

427
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,080
How about this

428
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,640
You hypnotize me again

429
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,400
See what I can find in my memory

430
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,400
Forget it

431
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,320
Go home and want to go slowly

432
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,080
How do you do, Mr. Lu

433
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,880
Your wine

434
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,600
No need

435
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:23,920
Brother Wang

436
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,720
Can you show me the archive book

437
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,520
It's not what I just said. You're not listening, are you

438
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
I said the page we want to check

439
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,560
Lost

440
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,400
I heard you

441
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,400
Luo team

442
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,240
Luo team

443
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,040
Chen Jiaxin

444
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,360
The file of case 803

445
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,080
Have you finished reading it all

446
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,800
Finished

447
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,800
Can draw pictures

448
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,760
Meeting

449
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,360
Now there is a girl whose picture is missing

450
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,680
Can you draw it

451
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,680
If you can remember clearly,

452
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,440
I'll be fine

453
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,400
Come with me

454
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,360
I have to go

455
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,160
Please wait for me

456
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,000
I'll go in for a while

457
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:19,920
Good

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Luo team

459
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,240
Commencement

460
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,120
I know this child

461
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,320
Her name is Li Mengnan

462
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,200
Li Mengnan

463
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,560
Right

464
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,720
I am particularly impressed with her

465
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,760
She entered the welfare home in the same batch as the little darling

466
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Why did she come here

467
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
This child's life is really bitter

468
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Her mother was arrested for taking drugs

469
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,080
Her father died early, too

470
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,080
How did her father die

471
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,360
It seems that he was killed because of robbery

472
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,080
The welfare home that Nannan and Li Mengnan entered at the same time

473
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,920
After that, the information was changed

474
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,600
So Dean Tian has been in the dark

475
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,600
This is the little darling

476
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,720
A girl abandoned in the park

477
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,040
And the Liu Ningning we want to check

478
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,320
Before adoption

479
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,880
The original name is Li Mengnan

480
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,960
That is to say

481
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,200
Li Mengnan's biological father

482
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,680
Died because of robbery

483
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,040
My biological mother was serving her sentence

484
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
So Li Mengnan was sent to the welfare home

485
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,920
Later adopted by the Liu family

486
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,440
Renamed Liu Ningning

487
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,760
And the person who stole Li Mengnan's information

488
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,680
Doesn't want us to find out

489
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,920
Then this will be easy to handle

490
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
Her biological parents' criminal records

491
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,400
Gaoling police station must have it all

492
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,240
Let's dock with our colleagues over there

493
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,320
We'll know who they are

494
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,600
Officer Liang

495
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,800
This is our archives

496
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,640
You guys watch it first

497
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,960
It's hard work

498
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,400
Found it

499
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,560
That's right

500
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,240
November 27, 2002

501
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,240
Location Li Junjia

502
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,840
Yang Xingchun went to visit Li Mengnan

503
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
As a result, Li Jun saw money

504
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,520
Robbing Yang Xingchun

505
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,560
The two men fought

506
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
Finally, Li Jun was killed

507
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,240
Yang Xingchun

508
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,040
Right

509
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,080
Liu Ningning is Li Jun's own daughter

510
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,440
What about Liu Ningning's biological mother

511
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,440
I have no idea

512
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,720
It says Li Jun once had a relationship with a woman

513
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,680
Long-term cohabitation

514
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
But because two people didn't register for marriage,

515
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,520
So there's no way to identify her

516
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,200
Right

517
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,760
It has Li Jun's former home address

518
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,240
Building 12, Xiangxinyuan

519
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,640
Unit three four zero six

520
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,600
Maybe the perimeter visit can get more information

521
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
OK, I'll inform the Luo team immediately

522
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,520
Twelve buildings

523
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,640
This should be it

524
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,560
Li Junjia's neighbor is surnamed Ma

525
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Is a teacher

526
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,440
I have lived here for twenty years

527
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Teacher Ma

528
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,680
Just got back from school

529
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,520
Sister Liu

530
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,840
I left school late today and came back now

531
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,800
Hard work

532
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,240
Then go out now

533
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Send something to the children

534
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,440
Good

535
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,800
Miss Ma, right

536
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,760
You are

537
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,960
Public Security Bureau

538
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,680
Don't be nervous

539
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,400
I know you have lived here for more than twenty years

540
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
So I have something to ask you

541
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,600
Sure

542
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,800
Then I'll put down my bike, okay

543
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,640
Good good

544
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,160
Let me help you

545
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,880
No, no, no

546
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,680
It's like this

547
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,440
I would like to ask

548
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
The four zero six that lives opposite you

549
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,280
Do you still remember Li Junjia

550
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,280
Be impressed

551
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,160
I remember the first time I met Li Mengnan

552
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,440
It was sixteen years ago

553
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,960
It rained heavily that night

554
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
I came home late because I was on duty

555
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,720
Just arrived at Building Twelve

556
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,760
I heard the little girl crying

557
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
Little friend, why are you here

558
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,200
Put your clothes on first

559
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,480
Why are you here alone

560
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,560
I

561
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,480
My brother

562
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,280
My brother is still at home

563
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,000
It's been a long time since we

564
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,720
There is no food left

565
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,760
I came out looking for food

566
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,880
I locked the door, but I don't have the key

567
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,480
It's okay. It's okay

568
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,640
Let's go home first

569
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,280
Let's go find my brother later, shall we

570
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,120
Come

571
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,960
What a heavy rain

572
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,440
Come on, hurry in

573
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,080
What about later

574
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,160
Later

575
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,680
I contacted the people in the neighborhood Committee

576
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,440
I don't quite remember his name

577
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,640
It was he who went to Li Jun's house and opened his door

578
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,280
Saved Li Mengnan's younger brother

579
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
But her brother

580
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm so hungry that I'm all skin and bones

581
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,120
Now I get goose bumps when I think about it

582
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,440
Are you familiar with this Li Jun

583
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
Not very familiar either

584
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,760
Is that when I was a child, I was from a village

585
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
So he was killed because of this robbery

586
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,320
Do you know

587
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,160
I know

588
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
After Li Jun died that year

589
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,360
Li Mengnan's mother

590
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,920
I also came back to find Li Mengnan several times

591
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,160
But she's totally crazy

592
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,840
I don't know if it was drugs

593
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,440
Or has it been hit by something

594
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,840
And then

595
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,960
I haven't seen her since

596
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,520
So this one

597
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,520
Li Mengnan, what's her mother's name

598
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,920
Seems to be called

599
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,120
Qin

600
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,440
His name is Qin Yan

601
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,000
You think this normal person can't be such a parent

602
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,920
When Li Jun was in jail, ah

603
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,880
Then Qin Yan

604
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
I can't stay home all day

605
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,560
Play outside every day

606
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,800
Leave two children at home

607
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:45,960
Finally, ah

608
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,600
One starved to death

609
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,720
Starve to death

610
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,480
Who

611
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,680
Li Mengnan, her brother

612
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah

613
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,040
I was rescued once before

614
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,400
But what

615
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,040
That Qin Yan is also infected with drugs

616
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,080
Intensify

617
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,080
And locked the two children in the bedroom

618
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,520
Crazy out there all day

619
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,040
So in the end

620
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,120
That boy

621
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,680
I starved to death

622
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,920
What's the name of this Li Mengnan's brother

623
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
Do you know

624
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,520
I really don't remember the name

625
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,360
A nickname

626
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,960
It's called Heiwa

627
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,320
Now that I think about it,

628
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
And thanks to that community worker

629
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,320
Go to Li Mengnan's house every other time to see more

630
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,760
Otherwise where

631
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,280
May starve to death in the end

632
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,520
It's not just a black baby

633
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,240
Even Li Mengnan

634
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,840
That's it

635
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,680
Save them twice. This is the same person, isn't it

636
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
It's the same person

637
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,440
Do you know the name of this man

638
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,440
For so many years

639
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,480
I really can't remember his name

640
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,080
You wait

641
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,040
Can you see if this person

642
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,600
Yeah, it's him

643
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
He was still young at that time

644
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Good

645
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,239
Lao Yang

646
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,800
Luo team

647
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,440
What kind of wind is blowing today

648
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,600
Blown you here

649
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,600
Come and see you

650
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,639
You said you could just call if you had something to do

651
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,400
And make a trip

652
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,040
Ask you something

653
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,760
You said

654
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,560
Sixteen years ago

655
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
You defended yourself against killing people and going to jail

656
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,360
The dead man's name is Li Jun, right

657
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,239
Yeah

658
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,120
What's the matter

659
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,920
His daughter Liu Ningning

660
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,199
Original name is Li Mengnan

661
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,320
Liu Ningning's name is Li Mengnan

662
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,480
It's Li Jun's daughter

663
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,639
That can't be

664
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,320
You must be mistaken

665
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,480
Come

666
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,480
Have some water. Have some water

667
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
There was a mistake

668
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
Someone made a mistake on purpose

669
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
Someone made a mistake on purpose

670
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
Switch the files

671
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,320
According to Teacher Ma's clue,

672
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,120
I found out

673
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
Li Jun is in prison

674
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,120
Qin Yan visited the prison twice

675
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
The most coincidental thing is that

676
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,200
When Li Jun died sixteen years ago

677
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Qin Yan

678
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,720
I happen to be in prison for taking drugs

679
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,560
He was not released from prison until 2012

680
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,240
Then Qin Yan is Liu Ningning's biological mother

681
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,840
This is similar to Dean Tian's description

682
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,640
It's just right

683
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Re-comb

684
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,040
You see

685
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,160
Year 2000

686
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,640
Li Jun's lover Qin Yan

687
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,120
To the eldest daughter Li Mengnan

688
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,720
The youngest son, Heiwa, is in a semi-abandoned state

689
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,280
During the period, Qin Yan will have two children

690
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Locked in the bedroom

691
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,520
Causing Heiwa to starve to death

692
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,080
Although Li Mengnan was finally saved by Yang Xingchun,

693
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,800
But he suffers from claustrophobia

694
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,160
Continue

695
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,720
Later, Qin Yan was imprisoned for taking drugs

696
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,760
Li Mengnan was taken by Yang Xingchun's mother

697
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,400
Raised for a year

698
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,360
Two years later

699
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,640
Li Jun is out of prison

700
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,880
I took Li Mengnan back from my adoptive mother

701
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,400
However, in Yang Xingchun,

702
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
When I went to visit Li Mengnan,

703
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,800
Li Jun

704
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,760
Robbing Yang Xingchun when he saw money

705
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,400
Finally, he was killed

706
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,160
This Qin Yan is in prison

707
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Save Li Mengnan, including the death of Li Jun

708
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,080
It's all this Yang Xingchun

709
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,440
That's right

710
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,200
Then Li Mengnan was sent

711
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,240
Chunguang Gaoling Welfare Home

712
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,800
Later, he was adopted and renamed Liu Ningning

713
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,280
Qin Yan was released from prison in 2012

714
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,120
I once went back to Xiangxinyuan to find Li Mengnan

715
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,280
And then disappeared

716
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,960
Then there is the 803 case

717
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,800
Gao Yongxiang was killed at home

718
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,920
Liu Ningning was unconscious in the partition

719
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,120
That is, Li Mengnan

720
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,720
There are omissions

721
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,560
The headless female corpse case was a year or two

722
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,360
Qin Yan's case is also a year or two

723
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
What if it's a case

724
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,680
What do you mean

725
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,880
Missing Qin Yan

726
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,640
Is the dead man in the headless female corpse case

727
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,280
Make a bold assumption

728
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,920
The identity of headless female corpse is Qin Yan

729
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,720
The killer chose to kill her after she was released from prison

730
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,800
After Qin Yan was released from prison six years ago,

731
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,960
I once looked for Li Mengnan

732
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,360
The murderer committed the crime

733
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,840
Is it related to Qin Yan's search for her daughter

734
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,720
Li Mengnan was adopted by the Liu family at that time

735
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Renamed Liu Ningning

736
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,120
If the murderer killed Qin Yan at this time,

737
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,040
Is it possible to be afraid of Qin Yan

738
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,720
Interfering with Li Mengnan's new life

739
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,960
The killer did all this

740
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,400
It's all to protect Li Mengnan

741
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,640
Kill Qin Yan and Li Jun

742
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Including Gao Yongxiang

743
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,280
It's not right

744
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,000
Didn't Yang Xingchun kill Li Jun

745
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,880
Social worker in welfare home

746
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,120
Saved Li Mengnan twice

747
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
This makes sense

748
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,840
These are just reasoning

749
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,680
The most important thing now

750
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,480
It's a comparison of headless female corpses

751
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
And Qin Yan's deoxyribonucleic acid

752
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,600
Lu bureau

753
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,680
Lu Fengping was detained

754
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,280
What happened

755
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,240
It has something to do with a disappearance

756
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,040
You recall it carefully

757
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
In the recent period,

758
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,280
What's wrong with Lu Fengping

759
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,600
If there's something wrong with him

760
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,800
We must not tolerate it
