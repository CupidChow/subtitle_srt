1
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,720
Lu Fengping was detained

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,840
What happened

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,720
It has something to do with a disappearance

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,480
You recall it carefully

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,880
Recently,

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,520
What's wrong with Lu Fengping

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,160
The night before last

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,760
He brought back a little girl

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,640
How many wild cats do you have

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm almost turning into a domestic cat

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,280
Where have you been

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,440
Why didn't you answer the phone

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,840
I went for a run

14
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,840
If there's something wrong with him

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,720
We must not tolerate it

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,280
Received

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,000
What's wrong

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,840
You guys go on

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
Can you give me a discount if I take two more

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,560
It's already the best offer

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,680
This price is already very favorable, do you know

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,360
Take all these

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,720
Panpan

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,400
Daughter

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:43,840
What daughter

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,400
I found you at last

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,040
You have me confused with someone else

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Come home with me, daughter

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,720
Let go

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,040
Daughter

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,400
What are you doing

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,120
Come home with me

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,640
Let go

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,360
What about you playing hooligans in broad daylight

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,480
What are you doing

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,280
In broad daylight

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Play hooligans, you

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
What about playing hooligans

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Put the knife down

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,320
What about you

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Panpan, where are you Panpan

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
Come out, Panpan

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
Come home with me and look forward to it

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,440
Hello

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm going to call the police

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,400
Come out, Panpan

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,039
Your husband threatens people with a knife in the street

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,440
Now we make a decision about it

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,080
Punishment of administrative detention for five days according to law

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,160
Why don't you sign here

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
I, our daughter

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,000
I haven't been able to contact you for two days

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,240
I didn't go home either

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
My husband has a bad brain

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
That's why I took to the streets to make trouble

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,800
Can I take him back

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,080
I promise

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Be sure to watch him in the future

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,680
No

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,840
This is the law

61
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,960
You just said

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,640
You have been unable to reach your daughter

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Did you call the police

64
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,280
Do you have any photos

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Have

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,200
Go

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,040
Let go

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
How dare you

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,160
How dare you sell medicine to me

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,880
Who are you

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,720
Why do you hit people? This is

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,440
Chase me

73
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Stop and don't run

74
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,520
Stop this way

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,960
Quickly

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,560
Chase

77
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,120
Get out of the way

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Don't run

79
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,640
Your side

80
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:34,839
Go

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,000
Over there

82
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Coming

83
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,720
Desperate

84
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,920
Are you Lu Fengping

85
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,840
Right

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
It's me. What's wrong

87
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,560
We suspect you now

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,880
It has something to do with a disappearance

89
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,800
I

90
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,080
Are you kidding me

91
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,680
Are you kidding me

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Come back to the station with us

93
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,360
You'll know

94
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,080
Row

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,000
What's going on

96
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,640
Wind level

97
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,240
Nothing

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,160
Police handling cases

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,880
Assistance and cooperation

100
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,120
Close the door

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,600
Old box

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,360
You make dinner and I'll come back to eat

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,200
Waiting for you to come back

104
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,040
Deputy Ma brought it back

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,400
That's him

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,320
He took this girl away

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,960
He also hit the bridge of my nose

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,840
Take it in for questioning

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,520
Yes

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,600
Sit down

111
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Hu Panpan's parents came to our police station to report the case

112
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,440
Said Hu Panpan was missing

113
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,520
According to our investigation

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,320
Hu Panpan appeared for the last time

115
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
It was the evening of August 1st at Phil's Bar

116
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
You wounded Wang Qiang in the Philo bar

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,720
Then take Hu Panpan out of the bar

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,160
Isn't it

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Yes

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,040
There is such a thing

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
This girl is called Hu Panpan, isn't she

122
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,560
Then that bald head is Wang Qiang

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,960
Police officer

124
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440
I beat people purely for chivalry

125
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,320
No

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
That is brave and brave

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
I was in the bar. I saw this bald head

128
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,200
But according to Wang Qiang's account,

129
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
He clashed with Hu Panpan

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It's because of Hu Panpan

131
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,280
Suspected of selling illegal drugs in bars

132
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Do you know about this

133
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,160
I don't know how to go.

134
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Police officer

135
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,720
I

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,320
I look at it and I think that bald head

137
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Than this girl

138
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,240
But it looks like a lot of bad people

139
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,440
After you take Hu Panpan out of the bar,

140
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
Where did you go again

141
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
I don't know her well

142
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,960
Where can I take her

143
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,920
After I separated from her,

144
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,840
I went home to sleep

145
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
Go home to sleep

146
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,280
What about the surveillance

147
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,880
What surveillance

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
All the surveillance near your home has been destroyed

149
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,200
What the hell is going on

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,760
There is no surveillance in my house

151
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,760
I don't care about the surveillance near my house

152
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
It doesn't matter. Me, too

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280
Lu Fengping, I tell you

154
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
We now seriously suspect that

155
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,520
You have something to do with Hu Panpan's disappearance

156
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,920
You'd better be honest with me

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,960
What do I want

158
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,200
Figure what

159
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,640
Land breeze level

160
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
According to our understanding,

161
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,480
You are the external consultant of the 615 task force, right

162
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
How to waste time with us, right

163
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,320
Lu Fengping, if you are really innocent,

164
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,600
Where have you been lately

165
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,560
What did you do

166
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,360
Why don't you dare tell us

167
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,200
Police officer

168
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I've already said it

169
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Work for the task force

170
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
Is signed a confidentiality agreement

171
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,920
They told me to keep it a secret

172
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,680
You asked me to confess

173
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,200
What do you want me to do

174
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,280
So

175
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Lu Fengping is nearest

176
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,880
I'm not with you all day

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,440
Luo team has worked hard

178
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,240
Can I meet Lu Fengping

179
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,120
Luo team

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,120
Here comes the Luo team

181
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
It's coming.

182
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,400
Hurry up and explain to these two police officers for me

183
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
Is it convenient to say a few words

184
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,720
Yes

185
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,320
Land breeze level

186
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,880
Make it clear quickly

187
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,920
What happened to Hu Panpan

188
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,840
Say what clearly

189
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,520
On the evening of August 1st,

190
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,720
You brought a girl home

191
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,840
Who is it

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,280
Hu Panpan was last monitored and photographed

193
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,280
It was also that night

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680
How do you explain it

195
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,840
And

196
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,080
August 5th

197
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,440
I'll come with Professor Ling to find you

198
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,640
Your trouser legs were covered with mud

199
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
You said you went running

200
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
I've been to your house so many times

201
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,000
Never seen it before

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
What dirt is there near your home

203
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,560
How do you explain it

204
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,360
Finished asking

205
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
On the evening of the first

206
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,960
After Hu Panpan and I separated,

207
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
I'm ready to go back to sleep

208
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
I happened to meet a female client

209
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,920
I am really tired

210
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,760
I am also worried that the treatment effect is not good

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,680
And let her go home

212
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,240
On the morning of the fifth

213
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,280
I did go running

214
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
A little back stepped in the mud pit

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,080
But what's wrong with that

216
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Land breeze level

217
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
You think about it

218
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
Do you know what you're doing

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,440
Luo Fei

220
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
You're not here to help me

221
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,840
Two police officers

222
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,200
Arresting people pays attention to evidence

223
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,520
Not by suspicion

224
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Besides, this case

225
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,280
It's not your business, is it

226
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,440
Officer Lo

227
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,480
Go away

228
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,080
Trouble

229
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,960
Walk slowly

230
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Let's get on with it

231
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,280
Boss

232
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,640
Luo Fei, they found Li Jun and Qin Yan

233
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,400
I will keep my promise

234
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,880
It will never implicate everyone

235
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,880
I believe you know what to do

236
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Corresponding

237
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,240
I will also comply with your request

238
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,760
Take care of her for you

239
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
Deoxyribonucleic acid of headless female corpse

240
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
The report has come out

241
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
The deceased was indeed Liu Ningning's biological mother

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,480
Qin Yan

243
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
It can now be confirmed

244
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,080
The murderer of Qin Yan Gao Yongxiang

245
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,200
Yang Xingchun is a major suspect

246
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,280
Xiao Sun Xiao Qiao Xue Bing stayed

247
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
Others apply for equipment and come with me

248
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,360
Yes

249
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,680
Wang Jing Chen Jiaxin

250
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,600
You two keep an eye on the front and back doors

251
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
Liang Yin and I

252
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Officer Luo is here

253
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,760
It came earlier than I thought

254
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
Come and sit down

255
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,560
Wait for me at the door

256
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,240
Don't worry

257
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,760
You be careful

258
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,040
Come

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,360
Sit down

260
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,280
Please

261
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:30,840
Come

262
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,080
Have a drink

263
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,560
Tell me about it

264
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,480
What happened to Liu Ningning

265
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
Liu Ningning is in my heart

266
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,160
Always my daughter

267
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,720
I remember

268
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
When I first met her,

269
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Her name is also Nannan

270
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,880
At that time

271
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,400
Li Jun is serving his sentence in prison

272
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,120
The child is brought up by her mother

273
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,000
I helped the neighborhood Committee that day

274
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,000
Teacher Ma is carrying a

275
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
Dirty little girl comes in

276
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,440
Said there was a child locked in the room

277
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,600
At that time

278
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,040
I thought it was just that the family forgot their keys

279
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,360
And breathing

280
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,000
That's great

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,520
Call an ambulance

282
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,720
However, this is only the beginning

283
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,720
Two children are severely malnourished

284
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,000
Whose parents

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,480
Can bring children like this

286
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,280
Isn't her mother out there

287
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,400
Why don't you take care of her

288
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,200
So her mother didn't show up

289
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,720
I heard from the neighbors

290
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,000
The man named Li Jun is serving his sentence in prison

291
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,480
The woman's name is Qin Yan

292
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,520
My daughter's name is Li Mengnan

293
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,000
The son's name is Li Mengshan

294
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,960
Because it looks black

295
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,280
So the neighbors call him Heiwa

296
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,280
Later

297
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,240
I found Qin Yan in the Internet cafe

298
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,400
The government considered her as a single mother

299
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,560
With two children

300
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,360
Just give her 800 yuan a month in relief

301
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,320
What about after this

302
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
Entrust the neighborhood Committee to send it

303
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,840
Do you have a fixed time

304
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,280
Right

305
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,800
What about every month

306
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,880
Me and a female colleague

307
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Send it to her

308
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,560
She only has that time

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,840
Will go back to clean the room and take care of the children

310
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
It's just for you to see

311
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,920
To get the money

312
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,600
You're right

313
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
What about when we first started going

314
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,200
We also feel that at home

315
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,560
It's clean, too

316
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,440
The child

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,800
It seems to be well taken care of

318
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
After a long time, I let my guard down

319
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,480
Plus the welfare home was busy at that time

320
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,160
So let her take the money herself

321
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,520
That's good

322
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,680
She's out of pressure

323
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,800
She took the money and went straight to relax

324
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,320
She bought drugs

325
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,960
She forgot to go home, you know

326
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,760
When I think of this time,

327
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,240
It should be a week later

328
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
I want to see the children

329
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,560
I'll call her

330
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,120
I can't get through this phone anyway

331
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,080
I felt bad at that time

332
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,160
As soon as I open the door

333
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,400
You know, there's a stench coming

334
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,839
This Qin Yan

335
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,920
She was afraid that the neighbors would hear the children

336
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Lock two children in the bedroom

337
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,839
That door is full of cloth strips

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
All these years I've been thinking

339
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,000
If I hadn't been too busy to neglect

340
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,560
If I could go to their house earlier,

341
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,600
Can you save the black baby

342
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,440
Nannan won't watch helplessly

343
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,680
Watching her brother die

344
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,200
And left a shadow of a lifetime

345
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
She shouldn't be called Qin Yan

346
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,440
She should be called an animal

347
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,000
Children because of this matter

348
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,280
With claustrophobia

349
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,520
What happened?

350
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,520
Qin Yan went to prison again for manslaughter

351
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,240
Nannan is left unattended

352
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,920
So

353
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,600
My mom and I adopted her temporarily

354
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,240
I found out at that time

355
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,880
I said, why doesn't the child have a memory

356
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,600
She can't remember having a younger brother of her own

357
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,880
And she can't be alone

358
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,800
Stay at home

359
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,680
Psychogenic amnesia

360
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
Encounter something unbearable

361
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,400
Choose to forget

362
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,360
Do you know how it feels

363
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,400
When I hold Nannan,

364
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,120
Go out

365
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
When we get to the yard,

366
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,640
She opened her eyes and looked at me

367
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,200
I'll never forget that look in her eyes

368
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,840
Full of fear

369
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
Desperate

370
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,840
When she woke up from the hospital again,

371
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
As long as you see me without me

372
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
She cried and made a fuss

373
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,920
Actually, during that time

374
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
My mother and I adopted her

375
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,040
My mother is very fond of her

376
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,760
Think of her as your own granddaughter

377
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,360
Our family has a happy life

378
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,200
See where you run

379
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Are you happy

380
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,720
Happy

381
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,400
Do you want to play again

382
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,000
Good

383
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,600
Play one more level

384
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,280
But at this time

385
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,320
Li Jun is out of prison

386
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,120
He took the child away

387
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,760
Li Jun, he is not a good bird

388
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,920
He took Nannan home

389
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,520
He still locked Nannan at home

390
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,360
No matter how the child cries or makes trouble,

391
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,480
He doesn't care at all

392
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
But what is even more terrible is that

393
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,160
I found out that Li Jun was also taking drugs

394
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,520
So you killed him

395
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
At first

396
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
I'll talk to Li Jun

397
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,080
I earnestly advised him

398
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,960
I want him to give up raising

399
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
We do everything for the sake of the children

400
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,080
Li Jun not only didn't listen

401
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,160
And the bad words are opposite

402
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,280
Li Jun

403
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,960
I just want to discuss it with you

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Give up raising things

405
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,720
Yang Ge

406
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,120
What do you mean

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,240
800 monthly benefits

408
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,040
Give up when you say give up

409
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,680
But it's not impossible

410
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,120
Or

411
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,320
You give me two hundred thousand

412
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,120
She's yours

413
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,040
How is it

414
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,240
You see

415
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,720
You know it in your heart

416
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,480
You can't raise children

417
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,640
It's all about children

418
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,320
Consider her

419
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,120
Yeah

420
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,960
How cute

421
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,480
She was born to me

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,720
She has to support her father

423
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
Every month

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,440
What about 800 benefits

425
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,040
To the age of eighteen

426
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,600
What about after the age of eighteen

427
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,480
She has to continue to provide for the elderly

428
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,440
I let her prostitution to support her children

429
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm her father

430
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,680
Are you still human? You

431
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,200
Don't think I don't know

432
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
You just have a crush on Nannan

433
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,000
How can a father treat his daughter

434
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
Say such a thing

435
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
I was rushing up my head with anger

436
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
When I reacted,

437
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
It's too late

438
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,880
After killing Li Jun,

439
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,040
I faked the scene

440
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,360
Let people feel

441
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,720
I acted in self-defense

442
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,800
Overdefense killed him

443
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,960
So you put Liu Ningning

444
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,360
Send to an orphanage

445
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
And turned himself in

446
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,880
That morning

447
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,880
A girl happened to come

448
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,040
Called Little Darling

449
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,400
Age

450
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
Similar to Nannan

451
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,560
At that time, I thought it was just an opportunity

452
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,360
In order to protect Nannan's identity,

453
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,200
I had to switch the files of two people

454
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,240
But the killing won't stop

455
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,800
Qin Yan will be released from prison sooner or later

456
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,880
I've been asking

457
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,600
News of Qin Yan in Prison

458
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
I'll kill her as soon as she gets out of jail

459
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
In order to protect Nannan,

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,840
I have no turning back

461
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,720
I know

462
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,040
Qin Yan for this money

463
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
She will definitely find Nannan again

464
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,680
What about Gao Yongxiang

465
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,760
Talking about Gao Yongxiang

466
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
That is to start from

467
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,240
Nannan and I met again and talked about it

468
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,440
I killed Qin Yan six years ago

469
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,360
I think

470
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Can't reveal her identity

471
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
This will affect Nannan

472
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,920
So

473
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
I also hid my identity

474
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
Go to see Nan Nan

475
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,360
I haven't seen you for ten years

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,960
I didn't expect

477
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,120
Nannan's first sight

478
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
He recognized me

479
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
From then on

480
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,720
I keep in touch with Ningning all the time

481
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,520
Until she went to college

482
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,680
Even when she was in love, she told me the first time

483
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,760
Why do you still have it

484
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,680
This is something you like

485
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,800
Of course I have to keep it

486
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,480
Thank you, Dad Yang

487
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
It's getting late

488
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,080
It's time to go back to school

489
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
I don't want to go back to school

490
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,360
Why don't you stay with me a little longer

491
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
All right then

492
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,280
Stay with you a little longer

493
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,040
Actually

494
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
I have a question for you

495
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,000
How

496
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,560
Fall in love

497
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,160
I didn't

498
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,120
Just

499
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,400
It doesn't count, does it

500
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
He confessed to me

501
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,400
I didn't promise him

502
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,200
I just don't know how to reply to him

503
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,120
So

504
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,320
I just want to ask you

505
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
Is that the boy from last time

506
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,840
I don't think you like him very much

507
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,240
What are you laughing at

508
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,920
I knew I wouldn't tell you

509
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,360
I might as well tell the bear

510
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,400
You said

511
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,600
Since you like him,

512
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,400
He likes you

513
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,640
Then be together

514
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,000
Love is a wonderful thing

515
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,080
Dad Yang

516
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,360
Let me ask you a question

517
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,000
You said

518
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,880
Did you ever fall in love in college

519
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,680
Excuse me

520
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,640
I forgot

521
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,920
You didn't go to college

522
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,400
You're bad

523
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,480
You did it on purpose

524
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Of course

525
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,320
Noisy

526
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,160
It's so noisy. It's so noisy

527
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,000
Go back to school

528
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,760
It's noisy

529
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,760
So Gao Yongxiang's time

530
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,480
Why did you kill him

531
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
At that time

532
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,480
I locked Nannan in my room

533
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,440
So that when she wakes up,

534
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,720
You will forget what Gao Yongxiang did to her

535
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,760
He has a plot against Nannan

536
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,640
So I decided to kill him

537
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,360
Take it back for investigation first

538
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,240
It's a pity that these flowers are spent

539
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
No one takes care of them anymore

540
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,840
Leave it to me

541
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,760
Lao Yang

542
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,920
The key to the archives

543
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,200
Has been at Dean Tian's

544
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,960
How did you put Liu Ningning's file

545
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,720
Stolen

546
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
No comment

547
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,280
Let's go

548
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,360
Land breeze level

549
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,480
Twenty-four hours have arrived

550
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,680
You can go now

551
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,680
Hard work

552
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,680
Old box

553
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
You just got back

554
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,400
I talked with Sister Zhang for a long time today

555
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,280
What are you looking at

556
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,040
Blind looking

557
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,360
Tell about a murder and body dumping case

558
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,160
It's quite scary

559
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,560
Scared to death

560
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,480
Curious

561
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,920
The cold cake I brought you

562
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,120
Have you eaten

563
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,960
I ate

564
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,760
There is a gift for you under the bench

565
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,800
Find her

566
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,440
Have the clue you want

567
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,440
There are guests at home

568
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,600
How many wild cats do you have

569
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,920
Why did you bring me here

570
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,960
Afraid of what

571
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,400
I won't hurt you

572
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm sorry

573
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,280
I'm looking for you

574
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,120
Because I need your help

575
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,200
If there's anything you need

576
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,360
You can also just mention it

577
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,920
Under Liu Ningning's file

578
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,520
There is a file of a little girl

579
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
Take it away

580
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,400
Don't let Luo Fei find out

581
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,440
Found Luo Fei

582
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,320
Why must I do it

583
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,520
If this goes wrong

584
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,440
Revenge

585
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,600
Don't try to report it

586
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,520
Gao Yongxiang's case

587
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,400
It's your chance to show your sincerity

588
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,400
I think you know what to do

589
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,040
Out

590
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,000
All right, all right

591
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,360
It's okay it's okay

592
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,760
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

593
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,160
Excuse me

594
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,880
What you gave me

595
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,160
I didn't do it well

596
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,560
At least there is a direction
