1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,120
Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,240
After deliberation and decision by Yaxuan Group,

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,800
Professor Ling's Psychological Counseling Room

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,160
In the future, it will be handed over to Miss Xia with full authority

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,320
Do you have any objections

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,200
No

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,160
The hypnotic performance is progressing normally

8
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,440
I didn't expect it

9
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
Bai Yaxing

10
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,840
Will cooperate like this

11
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,400
That's right

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,720
The cleaning plan he just mentioned

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
What do you think

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Before that,

15
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
I always thought his real purpose

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,280
Is through hypnosis

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
To judge some people who can't be judged

18
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,120
But Zhang Ming's death

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Completely contrary to this logic

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,440
So I can't tell now

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
The cleaning plan he said

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
What exactly is it

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,920
Luo team

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,920
Xia Mengyao is about to start a hypnotic performance

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,720
Stop at once

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I've tried

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:44,880
May

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,360
This was signed and agreed by Professor Ling before

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,080
And

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
All the formalities and contracts have been read

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,960
Fit tightly

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,720
No problem

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
It's about to start

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,280
Is there any target

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,200
Specific group performances

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,360
As if

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,680
It is a psychotherapy for patients with depression

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,160
That's right

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
There is also a live broadcast on the Internet

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
Send me the live link

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Keep an eye on the scene

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Received

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,360
Luo team

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,560
I'd better go there

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm with you

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Farewell

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
I can do it by myself

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,080
There is also a white Asian star here

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
I'll send you a message if there's anything

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
Master Lu

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
Come to see the show

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,920
Xia Shimei

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,920
What do you mean

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
The performance will begin later

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
You'll know what it means

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,120
Excuse me, please

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,720
Hello, everyone

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
Welcome everyone to attend

60
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,640
Mind rainbow hypnosis performance

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm today's hypnotist

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,000
Xia Mengyao

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,080
Before today's hypnotic performance begins,

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,720
I hope

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
You can look at the people around you

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,960
Although we never met each other,

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
But

68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Each of us

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
It seems that they are all facing

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
The same kind of pain

71
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Be in a low mood

72
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
Distress and sadness

73
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
As if happy

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,880
Never belonged to us

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
And every time

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
We look at the people around us

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
When they are full of energy,

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
We will also ask ourselves questions

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
Why can't we

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,240
But

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
Is it true that we can't

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
You can think about it

83
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,680
When we were children,

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
How happy we were at that time

85
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,920
That simple time

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,120
We

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
Have all the happiness

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,920
What's the use

89
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
I can't go back.

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,120
But

91
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,680
We're in a dream

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
You can go back to your childhood

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,800
It just

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,200
Hidden in our subconscious

95
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Today

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
Just let me take everyone

97
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,640
To find

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,400
These happy moments

99
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,040
On this day

100
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,840
Before the hypnotic performance begins,

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
For a better experience

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
Please relax everyone

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Put on the headphones next to the seat

104
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,280
After wearing it,

105
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Come with me

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,280
Look at the big screen

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
Begin now

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
Please close your eyes

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,520
Take a deep breath with me

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
When inhaling

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,560
Put all the oxygen in the air

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,480
Inhaled into their own bodies

113
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,040
When exhaling

114
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
Put all your troubles

115
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,680
Pain

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,800
Unhappy things

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
All excreted from oneself

118
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,680
Relax

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,520
You are now in your heart

120
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
Without a hint of pressure

121
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
You're in a place where

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,280
A park with cool shade

123
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Sit on a park bench

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
You can smell it

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
The fragrance of grass

126
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
And the sound of gurgling water

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,200
You can still hear it

128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,880
A little birdsong

129
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,440
All the feelings

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,240
They are all happy

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
You're in a place where

132
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,120
Makes you happy

133
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,800
A very relaxing moment

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
Those bad things

135
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,840
It hasn't happened yet

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,240
I love you, will you marry me

137
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,760
We won the bid for this project

138
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,080
Finally won

139
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,280
Dad, I want to hug

140
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,880
Hold me, will you

141
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,920
Actually

142
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,000
These beautiful happy moments are always there

143
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,800
It's just

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Need us to find it

145
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,520
How is it

146
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Is there any progress

147
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,720
Since you left,

148
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I didn't say anything useful

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,080
Yeah

150
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,880
Watching this live broadcast is just an ordinary hypnotic performance

151
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,920
What does this Bai Yaxing want to do

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,760
Next

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I'll count to three

154
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,040
Everybody

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,920
They all wake up from memories

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,440
1

157
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,960
II

158
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,600
III

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
In fact, in our life,

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
There are many such happy moments

161
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
And what

162
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
It has always been with us

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
I hope all of you here today

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,400
No matter what happens

165
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,120
Any time of hardship

166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,960
We all have to imagine

167
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
These beauties

168
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Today's spiritual journey is not over yet

169
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,360
The day after tomorrow at two o'clock in the afternoon

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Rainbow of our hearts

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
Continue to accompany you through

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
The next journey

173
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,680
Thank you all

174
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Interrogation of Bai Yaxing's confession and related materials

175
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
They were all sent to the procuratorate

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,920
Has applied for his arrest

177
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,680
With these written materials alone,

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,520
Can it really work

179
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,640
In the concrete judicial practice,

180
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,880
There are two kinds of evidence

181
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
Direct evidence and indirect evidence

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Indirect evidence

183
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,000
If a complete chain of evidence can be formed,

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,720
You can convict a suspect

185
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
This white Asian star

186
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
What other flowers can you dig out

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
He must have some purpose

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Voluntary surrender

189
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,120
He doesn't look like a repentant

190
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,000
By the way, Lu Fengping

191
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,360
Hypnotic performance

192
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,600
Have you found any problems

193
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
The whole performance was normal

194
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,560
There is nothing strange about it

195
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
So their purpose

196
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,440
This white Asian star

197
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Was diagnosed with cancer three years ago

198
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Then he doesn't have much time

199
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,080
Paint a kitten

200
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,400
And then to you

201
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,280
Could he be looking for an heir

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,600
Someone who can inherit his ideas

203
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,760
Already found it

204
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,000
Xia Mengyao

205
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,040
That's right

206
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,080
Depression

207
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,800
Happiness

208
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
Make everyone alive happy

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,200
Xia Mengyao once suffered from depression

210
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,160
So she thinks

211
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,520
People will suffer when they live

212
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,480
Could they be trying to use hypnotic assemblies

213
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,560
To implement their

214
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,880
Cleaning plan

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,680
If that's the case

216
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,080
Why didn't she act last time

217
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,200
If you want to perform hypnosis smoothly,

218
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,160
Hypnotized person

219
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,080
Must achieve absolute trust with the hypnotist

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,480
So Xia Mengyao didn't take any action in the last game

221
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,840
In order to gain trust

222
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,480
Go find Bai Yaxing

223
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,200
Take a good look

224
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,440
It's cross-disciplinary

225
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,440
Bai Yaxing

226
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,240
I know you're choosing an heir

227
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
It's Xia Mengyao, right

228
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,560
Land breeze level

229
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,680
I really didn't read you wrong

230
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,040
But today

231
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,480
The three of us are sitting here

232
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,600
Shouldn't we talk about something more interesting

233
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,600
What do you want to talk about

234
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,680
It was fate that brought us together

235
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Then didn't you find out

236
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,480
What happened today

237
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,680
It's all related to the Yangxian murder ten years ago

238
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
If it weren't for Liang Yin's distress,

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,000
You wouldn't have found hallucinogens

240
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,680
I won't be noticed by Officer Liu either

241
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,080
Became an informant

242
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
In order to gain the trust of Chen Qinan,

243
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,040
I work with the police inside and outside

244
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,200
Tamped the crocodile den

245
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
I thought this was the end of it

246
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,680
But when I escaped,

247
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,680
I met the crocodile's men

248
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,080
Floret

249
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,000
Later

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,160
I helped the police get Chen Qinan's criminal evidence

251
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
Paid up his den

252
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,160
Can be in the last action

253
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,560
I was almost killed by Xiaohua

254
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,640
It was Hu Dayong who saved me

255
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
You think you saved my life

256
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
It's because of you

257
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,400
Brother Crocodile took me for a mole

258
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,600
My whole family died at his hands

259
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
Wake up

260
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,680
If it weren't for me

261
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,040
You're dead

262
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,360
I know who you are

263
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,800
Give me a break

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
Don't touch that medicine in the future

265
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,880
You dropped it

266
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,520
Gomei gave it to you

267
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,640
Said it can keep safe

268
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,960
After they confessed,

269
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,959
There are no people who slip through the net in pharmaceutical dens

270
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,439
You can identify it carefully again

271
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
Except for those we killed

272
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,400
Are there any other pharmacists

273
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,239
If it weren't for me

274
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,600
You're dead

275
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,240
Give me a break

276
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,280
It's gone

277
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
See if there is any in it

278
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,520
No

279
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,480
I didn't give him up

280
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
But he will not change his nature

281
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,280
So I gave him to you

282
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,160
What about Yang Xingchun

283
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,600
How did it get involved with you

284
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,240
How did Officer Luo know

285
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,120
We have a relationship

286
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,760
Or else

287
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,960
How else would you know

288
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,080
About the welfare home

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
How could you use me

290
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,000
To steal files

291
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,440
Yeah

292
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Except for the hypnotist

293
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,840
I need other people, too

294
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,000
The people who are locked up here

295
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,200
I think there are still good people

296
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
I accidentally saw it a few years ago

297
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,400
Yang Xingchun's Archives

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,840
He did it for a girl who had nothing to do with it

299
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,680
Willing to go to jail by yourself

300
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,520
How ruthless

301
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
Is the person I need

302
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,440
So

303
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,360
In

304
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
So I found him

305
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,560
He has really helped me a lot over the years

306
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
How is it

307
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,120
He didn't

308
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,520
Give me up

309
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
He didn't give you up

310
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,000
Is afraid that you will hurt Liu Ningning

311
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,200
And

312
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,920
It is the law that maintains public order

313
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,480
Not you

314
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
If you go back to ten years ago,

315
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,360
Are you willing to let Liang Yin

316
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,120
Jean Deng Yan

317
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Are you in danger of being killed again

318
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,760
Land breeze level

319
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,400
You didn't choose to kill Hu Dayong

320
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,560
Hu Dayong has mental problems

321
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,680
He won't realize what he has done wrong

322
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,280
If the sentence is commuted,

323
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,720
There may be a chance to go out again

324
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
You may commit another crime

325
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,080
Do you think that's fair

326
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
Think about it

327
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,080
I'm looking forward to your answers

328
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,560
Wait a minute

329
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,960
Your philosophy

330
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,320
Is to get rid of those people

331
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,840
So

332
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,840
Is this what you call a cleaning plan

333
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,240
Let people in pain

334
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,880
Leave in happiness

335
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Let the world

336
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,840
One more joy

337
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
This is also a cleaning plan

338
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,120
That's right

339
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,920
I forgot to tell you something

340
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,280
My heir

341
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,640
Why can't it be you

342
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
Have all the materials been prepared?

343
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,160
You can start at any time

344
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,320
The procuratorate

345
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,360
All the materials have been submitted

346
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
Then it's hard for you

347
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,480
Run again

348
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,360
OK

349
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,160
What did he mean by saying that

350
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
What do you mean

351
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,760
Why can't the heirs be the two of us

352
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,400
Let's go to Professor Ling to find Xia Mengyao first

353
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,400
How's it going over there

354
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,640
Don't worry

355
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,280
My side is ready

356
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,800
No problem

357
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,640
Let's do this first

358
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,880
Master Lu

359
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,640
Officer Lo

360
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,840
Why are you here

361
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,680
Feilu bureau

362
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,320
Luo Fei

363
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,040
You come back to the station immediately

364
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,880
Not me now

365
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
Stop all your actions

366
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,000
Come back immediately

367
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,400
What's the matter

368
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,640
Is there something wrong?

369
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,000
Go

370
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
This thing is really amazing

371
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,600
You said

372
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
Why did Lu Bureau go to Luo Team

373
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
It's a good thing you're not an old iron

374
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,120
You are so

375
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
You call Lu Bureau and ask

376
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,800
Bai Yaxing went to the procuratorate with a lawyer

377
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,040
It's not what this boy is doing

378
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,280
He turned himself in

379
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,520
And then find a lawyer

380
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
Why do you want to commute your sentence

381
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
It's no use looking for anyone

382
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,280
Yeah, I'm telling you

383
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,280
It's hard to find anyone

384
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Small sample

385
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,880
Work

386
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,880
Come in

387
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,320
Lu bureau

388
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,440
What's going on

389
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,800
Why stop our operation

390
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
When you are in action,

391
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,080
Bai Yaxing

392
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,160
Has been approved for release

393
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,640
What do you mean

394
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,480
This is the material sent to the procuratorate

395
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
It has also been returned

396
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Refuse to arrest

397
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
Not only will you not be arrested

398
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,960
Bai Yaxing's lawyer

399
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
Today, I went to the high bureau respectively

400
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,080
To file a complaint with the head of the procuratorate

401
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
Said our criminal police team

402
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
In the course of interrogation

403
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
Adopted the means of extorting confessions

404
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,720
Forcing Bai Yaxing

405
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,400
Made a false confession

406
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,440
Extort a confession

407
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,640
Isn't there a video

408
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
He said we forced confessions

409
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,600
It doesn't say that we use force

410
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,440
Evidence

411
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,680
That's the confession transcript

412
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
The transcript says

413
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,640
Bai Yaxing tracks Zhang Ming

414
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,040
It's on September 5th

415
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,080
But they have evidence

416
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,080
That day

417
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,160
Bai Yaxing

418
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,600
Not in Longzhou

419
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,760
But the details in the confession he provided

420
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,600
It is completely consistent with our police investigation

421
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
But Bai Yaxing's lawyer

422
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,880
Just stick to this statement

423
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,320
Said this confession

424
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,760
It was simply concocted by the police

425
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,960
Bai Yaxing's lawyer

426
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
To this transcript

427
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
The application was made

428
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,320
Language feature identification

429
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,520
The appraisal results have come out

430
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,280
Suspect in the transcript

431
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
The linguistic features embodied

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
There are obvious differences

433
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,400
To be more specific

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,120
In his statement

435
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,240
For a while, it was his own language habit

436
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,120
For a while

437
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,760
It also imitates Xiao Chen's oral features

438
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
That's true

439
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,480
When everyone speaks and writes,

440
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,160
Have their own

441
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,760
Specific

442
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,520
Linguistic features

443
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
And this feature

444
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,640
According to

445
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,240
Region

446
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,160
Personal character

447
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,160
There is also a direct connection between education level

448
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,680
So even if you express the same meaning,

449
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,320
Everyone

450
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,200
Used

451
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,120
Vocabulary

452
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,240
Language

453
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,360
It's all different

454
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,800
Language feature identification

455
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,000
It is a kind of judicial writing identification

456
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,560
No wonder he was

457
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,800
There have been attacks on Chen Jiaxin

458
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,040
And asked him

459
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,720
Write it down verbatim

460
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
Premeditated

461
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,560
I was careless

462
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,400
It's quite good

463
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,360
Just this edition

464
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:56,960
OK

465
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,600
Hurry up and type it out

466
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,520
OK

467
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,920
It's been three years

468
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,640
What you told me before

469
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,360
I did it

470
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Bai Yaxing, president of Yazhen Group, suffered injustice

471
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,840
The lawyer has submitted the relevant materials to the procuratorate

472
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,640
Longzhou police said

473
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,360
We will seriously investigate and deal with this incident

474
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,640
If it is proved that it will never favor or tolerate

475
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,480
Accountability is also difficult to eliminate this trauma

476
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,920
Truth is the first

477
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,760
High game

478
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,440
If we do this

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,800
Isn't it

480
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,920
Is it exactly what criminals want

481
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
He Bai Yaxing

482
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,840
Take such a big risk

483
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Play such a trick

484
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,600
Isn't it just to disband our task force

485
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
Luo Fei can't handle the case

486
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,640
I understand

487
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,960
But Bai Yaxing

488
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,680
He is a well-known entrepreneur in Longzhou City

489
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440
Now this matter of him

490
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,360
It caused quite a stir in the society

491
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,600
Our police

492
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,040
An account must be given

493
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,840
Understand

494
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,120
Luo Fei

495
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,560
The suspension order came down

496
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,360
I accept

497
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,360
Organizational arrangements

498
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,840
Lu bureau

499
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,720
It's nothing. I'll go out first

500
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,040
Good

501
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,040
Are you guys weird

502
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Why am I telling you all this

503
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Now I know

504
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,840
Don't look at me like that

505
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm still saying the same thing

506
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,760
My heir

507
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,920
Why can't it be you

508
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,560
Officer Lo

509
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,880
You've already lost

510
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,680
Let's go

511
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,160
Why are you here

512
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,840
You should rest more now

513
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
Tomorrow the police

514
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,800
There will be some action

515
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,520
But they can't stop our plan

516
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,240
Now Luo Fei

517
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,560
Has been suspended under our plan

518
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,480
As long as this stumbling block is gone,

519
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,240
No one can stop us

520
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,680
Let's go

521
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,920
Let's go get something to eat

522
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,520
