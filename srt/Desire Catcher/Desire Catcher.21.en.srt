1
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,161
I'm going to buy two pounds of black sesame candy and send it over

2
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:31,961
Good for the heart

3
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:35,001
I inquired about it

4
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:36,681
This booth in Longzhou Park

5
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:37,201
Most authentic

6
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,641
Then be careful yourself

7
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:39,641
I won't accompany you

8
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,001
Don't worry, I'll be there later

9
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:41,961
I see

10
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:42,601
That's right

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:43,521
That's right

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,201
When will your car be repaired

13
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,401
My legs are sore when I walk these two days

14
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,401
Hello

15
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,321
Two catties

16
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:57,921
All right

17
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:03,361
You take it

18
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:04,841
All right

19
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,841
I would like to meet you

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,601
Bad guy, bad guy

21
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,641
You big bad guy

22
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:21,241
You big bad guy

23
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,201
Run fast

24
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,161
Bai Yaxing asked me to meet

25
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,201
Brother brother

26
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:30,881
Can you help me raise the string of my kite

27
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:33,001
I don't have the strength to put it high

28
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:32,681
A little closer

29
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,081
Don't blink

30
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:39,681
These days

31
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,401
Help the police investigate the case

32
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,081
Are you tired

33
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:45,641
Tired

34
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,281
Just have a rest

35
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:02,841
Mom

36
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,681
Mom

37
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:14,961
Mom

38
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,241
In this world

39
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,481
The person who loves you the most is dead

40
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,641
You must be in pain

41
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:37,681
Mom

42
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,161
Since it's so painful,

43
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:05,081
Why don't you get rid of it earlier

44
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,481
Land breeze level

45
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,161
Land breeze level

46
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,041
Do it

47
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,161
Land breeze level

48
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,401
Wake up

49
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:10,561
Wake up

50
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:13,081
Wake up

51
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,961
It has been arranged by lawyer Wang

52
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,521
Good

53
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,281
In a different way

54
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,601
Solve them the same way

55
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:40,401
What a big deal

56
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:42,201
Give me an infusion

57
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:53,361
How are you doing

58
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:54,481
Nothing

59
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:55,641
It looks more serious than me

60
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,601
Why don't you lie down for a while

61
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,281
Lie down for a while and I'll sit down

62
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,481
How did you get hypnotized

63
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,161
Bai Yaxing has calculated this

64
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:04,481
And

65
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,881
There must be something wrong with that water gun

66
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,561
Do you want to

67
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:09,721
That's a park

68
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,681
Where is the park

69
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,601
Old people, children and couples

70
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:14,441
It can make people relax their vigilance

71
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:16,721
Yeah they designed it all

72
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:20,281
Are you all right

73
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,161
The Luo team has caught all your attackers

74
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,041
It's all reviewed

75
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,081
The mouth is stiff

76
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:26,401
Just say it's a robbery

77
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:29,401
This Bai Yaxing must be ready

78
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,161
Let Chen Jiaxin get all the information ready

79
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:34,361
This time Bai Yaxing used so many people

80
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,241
I'm sure I can catch his loophole

81
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:37,241
Go back to the station

82
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,521
That's right

83
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,961
Ask Xiao Chen to buy me a cup of coffee

84
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:41,401
Do you want it

85
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,361
I don't need it

86
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,121
You're all right

87
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:45,721
Nothing

88
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,201
Don't you take a break

89
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:08,201
Jia Xin

90
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:09,201
Luo team

91
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:10,481
How did the trial go

92
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:12,881
I'm so hard-mouthed that I can't ask anything

93
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:18,961
Hello

94
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:22,601
Your Longzhou Public Security Bureau is quite magnificent

95
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,681
Mr. Bai

96
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,161
What are you doing

97
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,561
I came from the first place

98
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:32,361
What's going on

99
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:33,401
Go downstairs

100
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,321
You are Liang Yin

101
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,681
Officer Luo's sister

102
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:14,481
Officer Lo

103
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,801
You and Lu Fengping in order to catch Hu Dayong

104
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:19,881
But it's really not less tossing

105
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,081
What do you have to say

106
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,641
Go up and talk slowly

107
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,721
I thought you were gonna turn yourself in

108
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:27,161
Chen Jiaxin

109
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:03,001
He would choose to voluntarily turn himself in

110
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:04,961
What tricks do you want to play

111
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:06,241
See

112
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:11,201
It's almost time

113
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,441
This trial is mainly based on his words

114
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,521
Find direct evidence

115
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:17,921
Luo Fei

116
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:20,921
Bai Yaxing is a master of psychology

117
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,001
Very good at exploiting the weaknesses of human nature

118
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:24,721
You be careful

119
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,321
Don't you have you here

120
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:42,001
This chair is still so hard

121
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:43,481
Too hard

122
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,721
You've committed so many things

123
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:46,761
Didn't you ask for it

124
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:50,681
You're afraid of me

125
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,201
What am I afraid of you

126
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,761
The police arraigned the suspect

127
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,601
There is a principle in attitude

128
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,001
It is called strong when you meet strong

129
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:01,641
Weak is weak

130
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,281
That is to say

131
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,201
If you meet a person

132
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:06,241
A more cowardly person

133
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,001
Then you have to be gentle

134
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,121
This is conducive to mitigation

135
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,121
The other party let go of their wariness and worries

136
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,601
What if you meet a stronger person

137
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:17,041
You have to be tougher than him

138
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:20,641
Only in this way can we suppress each other's arrogance

139
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:26,841
I've always been honest

140
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,521
But you treat me with this attitude

141
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,881
It shows that you have already decided in your heart

142
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,081
You are the weak one

143
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:35,601
Right

144
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,721
I've been an informant since I was nineteen

145
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:45,201
Helped the police solve the biggest case of the year

146
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,761
Don't look at me sitting in this interrogation chair now

147
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,201
I still have a lot of things

148
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,081
What I can teach you

149
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:51,801
What do you want

150
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:52,321
Xiao Chen

151
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:53,641
Control one's emotions

152
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:54,921
He's trying to provoke you

153
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,241
Calm down

154
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,721
The nonsense is over

155
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,521
Then have a chat

156
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:03,681
Why come and turn yourself in

157
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,921
Conscience is uneasy

158
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,601
I can't sleep

159
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:08,201
It's coming

160
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:09,601
Think about

161
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:12,361
I can sleep better when I come to you.

162
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:14,841
Row

163
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:16,801
Give him a warrant to sign

164
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:21,561
Bai Yaxing

165
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,441
You are suspected of intentional injury

166
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,601
Crime of intentional homicide

167
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:26,721
You are now under criminal detention

168
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,281
You have the right to inform your family and your lawyer

169
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:33,801
No need

170
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:36,921
I don't have any family

171
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,481
We know you have lymphoma

172
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,201
If you feel unwell during trial and detention,

173
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,321
You can take medical treatment on parole

174
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,321
I don't think you are very old.

175
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:47,961
Haven't solved a few cases, have you

176
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,361
Let an inexperienced policeman

177
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:54,441
Give me a transcript

178
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,201
Can you do it

179
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,161
I will write down every word you say

180
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,361
You can't go wrong with a word

181
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:02,601
That's good

182
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:04,201
Let's talk about it

183
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:06,481
How did you meet Xia Mengyao

184
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,521
I met him in the hospital before

185
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:14,521
I have lymphoma

186
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,161
Don't you know

187
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:19,960
So how did you meet Officer Liu Hao

188
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,881
About me and Liu Hao

189
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,440
Then we have to start ten years ago

190
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,200
I was at that time

191
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,881
Is just a thug in the gang

192
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,161
Until we were destroyed by the police in Lanxian County

193
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:35,200
Go

194
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:45,921
Let go of me

195
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:52,921
Boss

196
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:54,801
Brother, go quickly

197
00:17:58,921 --> 00:17:59,401
Go quickly

198
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:00,361
Move again. I'll shoot

199
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,041
Go quickly

200
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:09,801
Go quickly

201
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:19,801
Cuff this side

202
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:22,601
Quickly

203
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,201
That day

204
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,201
Not only was it the first time I met Liu Hao

205
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,881
It is also a turning point in my life

206
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:34,561
Chen Qinan's main business

207
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,961
Is to make hallucinogens

208
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,161
And his men

209
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,601
A brand-new product has been developed

210
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,441
What you need to do

211
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:44,881
Is to find a den to make hallucinogens

212
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,201
Lock in evidence

213
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:51,881
After Liu Hao caught me,

214
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,841
Let me turn to be his informant

215
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,001
I promised him

216
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:06,881
You remember

217
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:09,441
Protecting yourself is the first priority

218
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:12,761
You should write down these materials

219
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:14,921
Good

220
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,641
The target I want to approach

221
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:20,041
It was Chen Qinan, my former eldest brother

222
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,521
Liu Hao trained me for a while

223
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:25,681
Just waiting for Chen Qinan

224
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,321
Come back to Lanxian County

225
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:31,001
We should be careful every time we meet in the future

226
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:32,561
Every Wednesday afternoon

227
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:34,001
I'll be here waiting for you

228
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,201
Pay attention to safety

229
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,321
It is reported that Chen Qinan is back

230
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:41,521
My action has also begun

231
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,281
Liu Hao helped me make a series

232
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,481
Records of detention

233
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,961
Let Chen Qinan put down his guard against me

234
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:51,041
It didn't take long

235
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:54,601
I was asked by him to meet them at their base camp

236
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:03,601
50,000

237
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:04,721
Five cakes

238
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:17,321
Big Brother

239
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,001
Good brother has made you suffer

240
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:30,281
The house said

241
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:32,961
Big Brother Big Brother

242
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:41,361
Substar

243
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,081
If it weren't for you last time

244
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,321
I must be the one going in

245
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:45,321
How is it

246
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:46,921
The police didn't embarrass you, did they

247
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,241
I didn't force you to say anything, did I

248
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,121
Force

249
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:49,841
It must be forced

250
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,841
Forty-eight hours without me sleeping

251
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:53,241
But I didn't say a word

252
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:00,681
Substar

253
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,361
From now on

254
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,641
You are my own brother

255
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:06,361
Please feel free to come to me if you have any difficulties

256
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:07,721
Brother Xie

257
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:13,561
Big Brother

258
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,161
Have you had anything lately

259
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:17,321
Work with faster money

260
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:21,521
It's like this

261
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,561
I've had something at home recently

262
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:25,081
Private affairs

263
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:32,161
Don't mention it

264
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:33,881
If there is any inconvenience

265
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,121
I'll find my own way

266
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,161
There is nothing inconvenient about it

267
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,041
It's just that there was a man in business recently

268
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,241
Always aiming at me everywhere

269
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,281
Who is it

270
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:45,241
Do you want me to take care of him for you

271
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:48,921
This man is mixed up as a crocodile

272
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:49,961
Very arrogant

273
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:51,521
Always against me

274
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,401
Substar

275
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,361
I want you to take some brothers to clean him up

276
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:58,001
After it's done,

277
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:00,201
There is no problem that cannot be solved

278
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,561
No problem, big brother

279
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,201
That was the first time I met Hu Dayong

280
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:14,881
But I didn't know his identity at that time

281
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:15,481
Nan Ge

282
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:18,721
There is not enough material in the kitchen

283
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:19,841
Get out of here

284
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:23,201
Psycho handyman

285
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:26,921
Ignore him

286
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:27,481
Drink tea

287
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,281
I can see that

288
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,201
He is very important to Chen Qinan

289
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:37,641
But my first priority at that time

290
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:40,441
Is to gain enough trust from Chen Qinan

291
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,401
Chen Qinan gave me a task

292
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,401
He told me to take out another gang

293
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:50,321
Their boss is called Crocodile Brother

294
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:51,801
Brother Crocodile's gang

295
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,121
I'll find a way to knock it out for you

296
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,481
Let you gain trust

297
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:56,401
Touch the pharmaceutical evidence as soon as possible

298
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,201
In the event of an accident

299
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:00,641
It is necessary to report in time

300
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,001
Don't act without authorization

301
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,001
Gomei gave it to you

302
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,041
Said it can keep safe

303
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,681
Attention of each group

304
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:21,681
Prepare for action

305
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:40,521
The police are here

306
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,161
Go

307
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:52,681
Stand still

308
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:53,601
Don't move, don't move

309
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,241
The crocodile gang was smashed by the police

310
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:15,281
Only Chen Qinan is the only one left

311
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,561
And I also entered

312
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,081
Inside Chen Qinan's gang

313
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,441
This crocodile is really funny

314
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,561
Finally, I let my little brother sell it

315
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:25,881
Be careful and move slowly

316
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:28,641
Asia Star

317
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:29,721
Take a look

318
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:32,201
After that, I went into the kitchen

319
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:34,241
All those knives and guns

320
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,241
You don't do it

321
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,321
That's our cook

322
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:43,761
That time

323
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:46,201
Chen Qinan finally took me to see them

324
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:47,881
Pharmacist Hu Dayong

325
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:56,561
Get up

326
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:01,561
Self-produced and sold every day

327
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,801
What kind of money do I make

328
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:04,161
Get up for me

329
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:05,961
Get up, get up

330
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:07,481
Get up, get up

331
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,681
Drug-making dens and evidence have been found

332
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,241
I asked Liu Hao to report to him

333
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:18,281
The location is all here

334
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,401
I also got the evidence you asked for

335
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:28,961
According to the clues I provided,

336
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,721
Liu Hao began to close the net for Chen Qinan

337
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:34,481
Three teams and one team act together

338
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,361
Flank-flank

339
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:37,321
Strictly guard against all exit alleys in the village

340
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,281
After entering the den,

341
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:39,841
Protect the evidence at the first time

342
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:40,841
Move fast

343
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,761
Never let Chen Qinan run away again this time

344
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:22,561
Everybody come with me

345
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,001
If you don't believe it

346
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:25,241
Just come and inspect the goods

347
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:26,641
Have a slice

348
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:28,481
I'll keep you happy

349
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:30,481
Asia Star

350
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:32,001
If you want business to be good,

351
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,201
Nan Ge

352
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:33,801
There are police

353
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:34,561
The police are here. The police are here

354
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:36,361
What

355
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:38,721
What are you still doing

356
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:39,721
Pour the goods quickly

357
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,121
Pour me the medicine. Come on

358
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:42,361
This, this, this

359
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,281
It's all down.

360
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:44,041
Quickly

361
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:44,841
This way

362
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,001
Can't stay, can't stay

363
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:47,401
Sewers, sewers, hurry up

364
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,881
Pour the garbage bag into the toilet at once

365
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:53,521
Stir it for me if it's blocked

366
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:53,961
Don't move

367
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,121
Don't move. Be honest

368
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,121
Chen Qinan people were caught with stolen goods

369
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:10,641
My mission is over

370
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,801
And after the end of the sentence,

371
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:14,561
I just want to live a quiet life

372
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:16,361
If you don't believe me

373
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:18,241
You can check it yourself

374
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:23,481
Then let's go back to this case

375
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,241
You can talk about it first

376
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,121
Why hypnosis

377
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,561
Murder Zhang Ming

378
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:33,201
Because he fits my target right now

379
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,281
He lived a miserable life

380
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,561
Alone, alone

381
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,041
Such a retired old man

382
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:43,801
There is no value

383
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,761
What about me? It's in

384
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,121
On the morning of September 5th

385
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,401
I met him in the morning market

386
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,881
He has a hobby of raising pigeons

387
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,481
So I hypnotized him

388
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:58,521
Let him put himself

389
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:00,241
Just fantasize about being a dove

390
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,801
Can fly freely

391
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:07,041
Die comfortably in happiness

392
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:10,121
What about painting kittens

393
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:11,841
Why did you bring him in

394
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,321
There are also 615 cases

395
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:15,361
Paint a kitten

396
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,841
He is just like Lu Fengping

397
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,401
Passed my talent test

398
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:21,961
But it's a pity

399
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:26,401
This Lu Fengping's determination and belief

400
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:28,881
It's far less than painting kittens

401
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:34,201
I brought the kitten in

402
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:35,961
Nature is to help him

403
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:37,721
What about Xiao Xifeng

404
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:40,321
Gave him a good psychological foundation

405
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,881
So it's easy to teach him hypnosis

406
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,201
Those who forced Tu Liansheng to death

407
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,241
They all deserve it

408
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,321
Guilty will naturally be punished by law

409
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:52,921
Who do you think you are

410
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,001
You are wrong

411
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:56,761
That's your understanding

412
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:01,281
Whether it's puncturing tires or slapping

413
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:03,121
To a kind person

414
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:04,121
Do these things

415
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:05,321
In my eyes

416
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:08,121
Then you should get a trial

417
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:10,601
Two police officers

418
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:12,641
Don't you think

419
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,201
What I do

420
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,761
Is justice above the law

421
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,161
So it seems

422
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:22,961
You are an extreme individualist

423
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,001
That's right

424
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,241
Actually, I've always had a question

425
00:30:27,321 --> 00:30:28,241
I want to ask you

426
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,121
What do you think of environmental protection

427
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,121
Why did he suddenly mention environmental protection

428
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:38,761
How

429
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:39,841
Are you interested in environmental protection

430
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:40,721
And my own opinion

431
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:43,921
What does investment hypnosis have to do with environmental protection

432
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:45,601
Then I can't tell you

433
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,121
This is a huge secret

434
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,041
But I can tell you

435
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,521
The code name of this project plan

436
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:00,961
Cleaning plan

437
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:07,241
What I just said

438
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,241
You have to be verbatim

439
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:10,401
Record it all

440
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,801
My side is ready

441
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:27,761
How's his side

442
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:31,961
He's already in. Everything goes according to plan

443
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:35,441
What we expect will come true soon

444
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:44,961
The cleaning plan must be completed

445
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,361
I want Ling Mingding to

446
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:50,081
See your whole life with your own eyes

447
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,161
Destroy

448
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,321
I'll take care of the police

449
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:00,081
Hello

450
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:01,361
I'm rushing over now

451
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:03,201
Don't come over

452
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:06,841
You come over now

453
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,721
Will affect the next plan

454
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:10,801
Don't come over

455
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:13,801
Jumping to death will be ugly

456
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,641
People who come to this place

457
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:25,681
It's all about living

458
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:29,881
To live one more day

459
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,001
But you have to bear more pain

460
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,401
Is it worth it

461
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,321
I was diagnosed with lymphoma

462
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:43,001
It's only been a few years

463
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:46,001
If you don't mind

464
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,081
Tell me about it

465
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,321
Think of it as

466
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:52,401
Hospice care

467
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:03,881
I always thought

468
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:06,721
Become a nurse

469
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,321
You can heal the wounded and rescue the dying

470
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:11,841
Care for the sick

471
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,241
Get them out of their pain

472
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:19,241
But then I found out

473
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,121
I can't do anything

474
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:27,601
These years

475
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,441
I've seen too many patients

476
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,881
Die in pain

477
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:38,721
Their families

478
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:40,601
Lover

479
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:45,481
Also grieving in where will you go

480
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,161
I'm tired

481
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm really tired

482
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,921
But nothing can be changed when you die.

483
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:00,921
Since

484
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,521
You can't see them suffering so much

485
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,121
Why don't you do something

486
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,681
Help them

487
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,841
But I just can't do anything

488
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:15,521
I just

489
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:16,721
I don't think so

490
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,001
I think you have done a good job

491
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,561
Or we can do it another way

492
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:28,201
Let them

493
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:29,961
Can die in happiness

494
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,041
Let the living people

495
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,041
Be happy

496
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:29,761
Is it smooth to approach Ling Mingding

497
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,641
I did what you said

498
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,881
Disguised as a depression patient

499
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,761
Approach him as a patient

500
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:39,081
He always thought he was the one who cured me

501
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:41,841
That's why I became interested in hypnosis

502
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:42,921
Teacher Ling

503
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,761
Is there anything I can do for you

504
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,881
He invited me to be his assistant

505
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:49,401
Help him deal with the next industry conference

506
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,961
Thanks to you

507
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:57,881
Lurking beside him

508
00:36:58,561 --> 00:36:59,721
So our plan

509
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,121
It will certainly go smoothly

510
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,281
Tu Xiao Mao was caught

511
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:10,121
Wouldn't we lose a lot this time

512
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,961
You know why

513
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:14,401
I won't let you get involved in this matter

514
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:17,041
Because my purpose

515
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,761
They don't have to die

516
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,681
But I want to take this opportunity

517
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,801
Imperceptibly

518
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,001
Communicate our ideas

519
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,961
He and Luo Fei are very close

520
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:32,401
You won't be afraid of an accident if you win over him

521
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:38,641
Once the seeds of doubt are planted,

522
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,161
It is bound to take root and sprout

523
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:43,401
What I have to do now

524
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,601
Is to give them another push

525
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,281
Compare fear

526
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:51,401
Trust and recognition

527
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,761
It can tie a person down better

528
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,801
I will design his revenge route

529
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:58,361
Let him in the process

530
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,481
It's right to see me

531
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:04,641
I've seen too many people

532
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,681
Struggling to die in front of me

533
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,081
It was your presence that saved me

534
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,081
Thank you for teaching me hypnosis

535
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:15,681
It gave me hope and faith to continue to persist

536
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:17,841
What you do

537
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:19,921
Is what I'm after

538
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,481
What's your friend's name

539
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:23,681
That's it, then

540
00:38:24,641 --> 00:38:26,281
After that, if there is any problem

541
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,521
Let's discuss it some time

542
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:29,921
Sure

543
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:33,281
This therapy of mine

544
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:35,561
It is a therapy that can bring hope to patients

545
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:36,681
This accident

546
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:38,361
Someone must be secretly

547
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,281
What kind of heart bridge treatment

548
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:40,081
It turned out to be all lies
