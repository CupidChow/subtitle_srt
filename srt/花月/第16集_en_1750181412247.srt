1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish to see you again.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wish to see you again.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wish to see you again.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I wish to see you again.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I wish to see you again.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I wish to see you again.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wish to see you again.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I wish to see you again.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I wish to see you again.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wish to see you again.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wish to see you again.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wish to see you again.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wish to see you again.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I wish to see you again.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The End

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My mother is fake?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Lu Bu Ping

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you really believe what I said?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I believe

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Of course I believe

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is the result of my practice

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
based on the book you gave me

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to practice Qing Gong

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Go

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It shouldn't be

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am the student of the school

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
According to the book

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I should jump from the high place

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to the low place

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Lu Bu Ping

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Look carefully

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Is your book

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
wrong?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My god

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's okay

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's okay

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's continue to talk about business

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lu Bu Ping

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At this moment

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There is an important secret

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's time for me to tell you

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What secret?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yue Qian Xue

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is your real sister

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And Lu Qian Qian

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is fake

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are my sister

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yue Yong

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I am Hong Yue

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I remember

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The traitor Hong Yue

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Did you deliberately make a fool of me?

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She is not a traitor

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
She was framed

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why should I believe you?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is too serious

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You tell me now

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My mother is not my mother

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My sister is not my sister

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hong Yue is here

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How can I believe you?

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you really want to know

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The blood is close

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The two are compatible

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Blood close

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My bitter

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sister

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sister

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let brother hug

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brother

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Brother

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Brother

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Brother

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Brother

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Brother

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Brother

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Brother

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Brother

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Brother

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yue Qian Xue

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How dare you

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You come up and give your brother a fight

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know the whole fight

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your brother hurt me in the worst way

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yue

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Stop it

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's talk about serious things

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Brother

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You better get up quickly

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have to go and help you in person

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't don't

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hold up

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hold up

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Next

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What we are going to do

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is like this

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Say it

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
About Lu Li

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How are you investigating

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The rest of the time

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is not enough for twelve hours

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Master

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Lu Li is not a traitor

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What do you mean

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because Lu Li is not from Changping

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
People

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
In the four centuries

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He is a spy sent by the West Mu State

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Spy

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Eighteen years ago

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's the forty-five years of the Mingdu

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He came to Changping for a big task

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The purpose of the campaign

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Qin Mu Tie

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Qin Mu Tie

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Is to return to our country

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
To support the country

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then who are you talking about

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Mistress

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You mean

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Mistress

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Father

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The recent investigation

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Things

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Are indeed a bit strange

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What you are talking about

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Say

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't be so hasty

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have checked with Yue Qianxu

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And he

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He is indeed

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My sister

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nonsense

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You are getting bolder and bolder

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ping'er, you are the blood of the young master

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How can you check it

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How can you check it

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For the truth, I will endure

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am sorry, Mistress

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am sorry, Mistress

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I regret it

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why didn't you throw it together

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Bold, let go of the Mistress

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let go of me

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hongyue

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Lao Wei

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You go out first

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Go out

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hongyue

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Left guard Hongyue

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Greetings, Mistress

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hongyue

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I have been looking for you for many years

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You guys

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Come with me

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Bell

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Two points come out

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wei Chen

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
no

179
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,380
don't

180
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
forever

181
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,100
no

182
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Come again

183
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,160
Li Chong

184
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,100
Ye useless

185
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
can't rest

186
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:51,920
but

187
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
let's have a party

188
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
let's throw it

189
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,000
King

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ping'er...

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ping'er...

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why am I so big?

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Ping'er...

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ping'er...

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Father...

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You...

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When did you become fake?

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know.

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You...

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why do you keep...

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You keep putting me in your heart?

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All these years, I've been looking for your traces.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why?

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why can't I find you?

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was looking for you too.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I got news from Changping.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I heard that you attacked Madam.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This time, I don't believe it.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I...

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then...

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then...

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then I left Tianqi Pavilion and looked for you everywhere.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I couldn't find you.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
When the full moon was full moon, I wandered to the sunset.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I disguised myself as Mr. Sun Ming.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I just wanted to get your news.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Thank you so much, sir.

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're so accurate.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're welcome.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Have you ever heard of a girl named Hongyue?

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've never heard of her.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry, sir.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Did you hear that?

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Tianyan is so accurate.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Ming Tian is 50 years old.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
She's 3 inches inside and 4 inches outside the city.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
She's not bad.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why don't you try it?

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If she's accurate,

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
she doesn't need to ask if she knows about the full moon.

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She'll know when she's done.

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
She doesn't need to ask.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I was looking for the full moon.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I saw the full moon.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I...

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I asked someone to bring her back to the mansion.

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I wanted to ask her

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
about the incident that happened last time.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Because...

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Because...

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
since the woman went missing,

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
she's been acting weird.

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Sir!

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Master,

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Shu Chengjun found the lady in the city.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He sent her back to Changping.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Did you find her?

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is she okay?

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
She's okay.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She's just a scratch.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hurry up.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll go check on her.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Madam,

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I cooked this porridge for you.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Madam.

257
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Try it.

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Master,

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm so grateful.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Look at you.

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why are you so familiar with us?

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Here.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Master.

264
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This is...

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is the sacred thing I got from praying.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
As long as it's in the dragon vein,

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
it'll be a blessing for Changping.

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
May you be blessed with good health.

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Madam.

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Usually,

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
when I'm alone,

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
you call me

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
husband and

274
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
beloved.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Why are you so mature today?

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You're so mature.

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Are you blaming me

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
for not going to the mountain to pray with you?

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, no.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I...

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I just didn't react

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
when Hongyue attacked me.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now I'm just

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
feeling more secure

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
after saying it.

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know which country

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
bought this Hongyue.

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How dare you do

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
such a big crime?

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm lucky to have been helped by the jade knight.

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I've only seen a life.

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You mean...

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Lu Li.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm Lu Li.

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Greetings, Madam.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In the Western让s,

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
there were also guests coming from the Western blasphemy peer.

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,500
Now the streets are curious.

300
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,560
You think about it,

301
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Altered Moon!

302
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,440
Have you seen
