1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Amazing!

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I knew you could do it.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You really cured me.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yue Tianshui, you can do it.

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or you can follow me.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yue, let's go home.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think what uncle Shang said is right.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Lord Zhenbei, look.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I didn't tell him to go.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He didn't want to go.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yue, you made a lot of trouble.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Fly, fly, fly.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can fly.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Amazing.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll go in.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The new queen.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tell me.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why did you come to Changping City

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to marry Yue Tianshui?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you think I'll tell you?

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Mrs. Zhu.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
General Ye, you've worked hard.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll do the interrogation.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Help! Help!

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mrs. Zhu, are you okay?

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm fine.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Dad was out.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My father was at the beach.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He came to me.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Miss.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Miss.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wake up, miss.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Miss.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Today is your birthday.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's get up and wash up.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Chang'er, where's my moon shadow?

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Moon shadow?

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I saw the prince secretly

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
changed the moon shadow into a flower circle this morning.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Again, again.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Crane.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Crane, the climax.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh my god.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Harry and leave me alone,

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mr. Harry.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mr. Harry.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your Highness, Miss Yue'er...

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Xiaoqi, you may leave.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where is my moon shadow?

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yue'er,

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know it's your birthday today.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I personally made a painting of the moon.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't do a good job.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yue'er, don't be disliked.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't want any killing.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I only want my moon shadow sword.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yue'er,

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yue'er,

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Your Highness,

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
this girl Yue'er came back from Tianji Pavilion

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
seems to have changed.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did something happen?

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Xiaoqi,

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
get ready.

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's go to Tianji Pavilion together.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your Highness,

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the east emperor has surrendered.

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Your Highness,

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
your head...

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The east emperor's blood is actually...

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yue Jinxi,

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
you really came back.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Your Highness,

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yue Jinxi,

82
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you really came back.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You came back.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Your Highness,

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it's been twelve hours since Miss Yue left Tianji Pavilion.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You said she came back.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What do you mean?

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How did I come back to Tianyuan for six years?

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hua Qingming,

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
do you really want to kill me?

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Miss,

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Miss, you're back.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, right.

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just found out that the string of this bell broke.

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I put it on again for you.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This thing is called the east emperor's bell.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a piece of the east emperor's jade.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You gave it to me?

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why?

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's too precious.

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Miss Yue,

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you'll know when you come back

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
with this east emperor's bell.

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sir,

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can come back anytime.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why do I need to use the east emperor's bell?

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Everything is in the hands of the gods.

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Chan'er, come with me to Tianji Pavilion.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hongyi,

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm here.

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Go to meet General Yue.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
General Yue?

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Who is General Yue?

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm the son of the King.

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When did Miss Yue become a general?

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No need to say more.

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
General Yue,

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I've been worried about you these years.

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How do you know I'm General Yue?

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If I didn't know,

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
General Yue wouldn't come to see me today.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The east emperor's bell is very precious.

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you remember

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
when you came to Tianji Pavilion to study,

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
the east emperor's bell was in your hands?

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm Yue Qianxue.

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Nice to meet you.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The east emperor's bell

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
was born in the heaven.

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:31,900
The

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I?

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yue Qianxue,

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
when you live,

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
don't be filled with hatred.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You are responsible for saving the people.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now I know

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
what you mean by coming back.

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But my death

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
has nothing to do with the people.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll take this matter as my wife.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
General Yue needs to find out for himself.

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But I think

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
General Yue will understand it himself.

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll go after the candy and the third meat-upbeat food.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Xiao Yuhong,

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
loli gun come.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay, let's go.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Young Masterね

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Liu Ma

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I find a company

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to welcome them.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
asterdo

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Little dear is

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
��

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What is it?

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Only today

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
kids could understand

159
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The world will be in a big crisis.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And Miss Yue is the key to this big crisis.

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sir, is there any way to stop this from happening?

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Bring the winter spirit with you.

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You will know everything in the future.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Isn't this Qingming's carriage?

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Qingming!

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Move aside.

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Qingming, what are you going to do?

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Qingming, hurry up.

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I heard that there is a snake in front.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's interesting.

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Come with me.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This way.

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Qingming.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come on.

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Come on.

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This way.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Look.

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's fun.

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Look.

181
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The snake is coming out.

182
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What's going on?

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Where is my snake?

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I was still here just now.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Nonsense.

186
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You played a trick on me.

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You even lost your snake.

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Qingming, no.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Qingming.

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Your hand.

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Your hand.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Qingming.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You are being played by a little snake.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Miss.

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yue.

196
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now I will answer you.

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why do I always meet him?

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So annoying.

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't follow me.

200
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Annoying.

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yue.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yue.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yue.

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's Yue's letter.

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yue.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yue.

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yue.

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh no.

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a bad omen.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The story is a long dream.

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Who knows the true meaning of the grudge?

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The night is lonely.

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The thousand years of long wind.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No end.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,280
The

216
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
wind is swaying.

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's wrong with life?

218
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Love and hate are just a window.

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The flower and the snow fall.

220
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We are in love.

221
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Who will I live for?

222
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The yearning is like a dream.

223
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The dream is like a dream.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Love is just a moment.

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The lonely night is like a dream.

226
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The night is lonely.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The song is just a song.

228
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The world is like a dream.

229
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The flower and the snow fall.
