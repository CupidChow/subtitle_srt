1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is theiance

3
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,060
is from exit

4
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:28,440
001

5
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Liar!

6
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
Maybe I'm not lying to you.

7
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
She may have been looking for you.

8
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,200
Hongyue.

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
What's your name?

10
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,920
Hongyue.

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,760
The traitor who betrayed the country 18 years ago.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
Hongyue.

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,120
You...

14
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,720
Let go of me.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,520
Don't be so mean.

16
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,280
It's useless.

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
You'd better behave yourself.

18
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,000
Let go of her.

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,440
You damn traitor!

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,720
Who are you?

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,320
If you go out,

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,920
I'll break your head.

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,040
I'll break your head.

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Hit me.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,160
Behave yourself.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Let go of me.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,840
You're quite hot.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,000
You're strong.

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,280
I'll blow you up

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
when I finish this.

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll blow you up

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
cleanly.

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,000
Brother.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,320
What's wrong?

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,600
You're so rude.

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
You hurt me.

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
You're so annoying.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,160
You've figured it out?

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
Good.

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
We're even now.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,720
We're even now.

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,120
We're even now.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,720
Come on.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,680
Brother.

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
What's wrong?

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,000
Look at my feet.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
They're tied up.

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
How can we

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,920
be at ease later?

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
I see.

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,640
Wait.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll be right there.

53
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,680
I'll be right there.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,440
Now?

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,800
It's urgent.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,440
Hurry up.

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,320
Untie me.

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,080
Hurry up.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,640
My legs.

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,920
Hold on.

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,120
Why did you say that?

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,160
For more than ten years,

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,280
I've been

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,880
a rich woman in the world.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
No one knows

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,120
my name.

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,200
Who is Hongyue?

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm afraid I don't know her.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,880
Eighteen years ago,

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
the mistress

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,320
had a personal maid

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,120
named Hongyue.

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
That year,

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,920
the year when the princess was born,

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,360
when the mistress

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,040
went to Wanfu Mountain to pray,

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,160
the guard Hongyue

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,000
suddenly attacked the mistress

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,320
and the princess who was still in the castle.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Thanks to God,

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,600
the mistress escaped with the princess.

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Hongyue failed in the assassination.

83
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,080
She escaped from Changping City and hid her identity.

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
Everyone in Changping City

85
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,480
knows about this.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,960
You shameless woman.

87
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
You attacked my mother that year.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
I...

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
I...

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I...

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
Zhou Guorenfeng said

92
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,200
that after you disappeared,

93
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
I disappeared too.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
But before he disappeared,

95
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,320
he said

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
he was concerned about Hong Chen

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
and left.

98
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,080
I believe

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,560
those who are concerned about people

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,280
will never do something that will be forgotten.

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
So Hongyue,

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
what do you know?

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
Can you tell us?

104
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,120
In the fortieth year of Mingdu,

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,280
I protected the mistress to go up the mountain to pray,

106
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,640
but I was attacked by the traitor.

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,480
The mistress was injured in the middle of her leg.

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,640
I had no choice but to drag the princess down.

109
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,520
At the same time,

110
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
there was a hairpin on the girl's head.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
I escaped for a day and a night.

112
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,880
I passed out in a desolate village.

113
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,160
Hongyue.

114
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,360
Hongyue.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,880
Hongyue.

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Hongyue.

117
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,480
Hongyue, where are you?

118
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
Hongyue.

119
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,160
Hongyue.

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,200
Hongyue.

121
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,120
Madam Chu.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Madam Chu.

123
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,960
Hongyue, you're so worried about me.

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,520
Give me the hairpin.

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
Madam Chu, didn't you just...

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
I was lucky just now

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
and avoided the chase and killing of the soldiers.

128
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,400
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,320
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I'll be right back to find you.

133
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Hurry up. Give me the hairpin.

134
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320
Hongyue.

135
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,880
Thank you.

136
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,880
Hongyue.

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,000
No.

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,320
You're not Madam Chu.

139
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,280
Let go.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,760
Damn it.

141
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,160
Why is it a piece of wood?

142
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
It's broken.

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,120
His Majesty ordered you to bring the hairpin to Changping.

144
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,640
Then you can move on.

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Then I passed out.

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,240
I knew nothing.

147
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
I was lucky to be lucky.

148
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,880
I didn't get hurt.

149
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,640
After I recovered, I found out

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
Hongyue had become a wanted criminal in Changping.

151
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,720
Now리

152
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,600
I went in the enters of the Cangag beat

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
and I found Hongyu's hairpin.

154
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,920
We didn't see anything.

155
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,800
Of course it's here.

156
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,840
All the cameras were in show before.

157
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,360
Only an old man could find Hongyu's hairpin.

158
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
After that, I was surprised

159
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,160
about Hongyue'sanna,

160
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,320
inflicted a hugeobile comarum and 허리

161
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,160
and ran to Chang meusui.

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,040
I thought this was difficult.

163
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,760
But it became δ

164
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
to turn it over with Hongyue.

165
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,880
disabilities or hearing disabilities

166
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,160
operators

167
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:02,580
or

168
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,800
kid

169
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,420
the female

170
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,140
The match?

171
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,440
The place where you fell down that day

172
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,580
was called Qingchuan Forest.

173
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,140
How did you know?

174
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,920
I'm Hua Qianming,

175
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
King of Zhenbei in Changping.

176
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
It's Yue'er.

177
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,740
So this is the letter

178
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,740
that mother left me.

179
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Miss Yue'er.

180
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,620
There is a birthmark

181
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,860
on your back.

182
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,220
But this birthmark

183
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,700
in the wolf's-b harvest.

184
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,420
This is the letter

185
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,060
that mother left me.

186
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,540
Yongbo,

187
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,100
I'm here to see you.

188
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Don't come over.

189
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Don't come over.

190
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Don't come over.

191
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Run.

192
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
I wanted to play with you.

193
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
But you did this.

194
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm not to blame.

195
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Run.

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
So you're the one who caught Lu Qianqian.

197
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Yes.

198
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I've been trying to find out

199
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
who the current Mistress is.

200
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
I've been trying to find out

201
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
who the current Mistress is.

202
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Who the current Mistress is.

203
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
What is the purpose of the Royal Physician

204
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
to become the Mistress?

205
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
I went to buy it in Changping.

206
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
I happened to run into Lu Qianqian

207
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
and played with her to get the elixir.

208
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,100
So I took the opportunity to catch Lu Qianqian.

209
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
After I caught him,

210
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
I was sure that

211
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Lu Qianqian

212
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
doesn't have the Six-Demon Star birthmark.

213
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
It means that the real princess

214
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,100
didn't fall into the hands of the fake Mistress.

215
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
What a coincidence.

216
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,100
You came to the Du Luo House that day.

217
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
But since you've seen the hairpin

218
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
and suspect that I'm the princess who was lost by you,

219
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
why did you let me take the risk

220
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
to steal the elixir?

221
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
The elixir...

222
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Your fake Mistress

223
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
appeared in Changping with me.

224
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Since the mysterious person and the fake Mistress

225
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
are so fond of the elixir

226
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
and the princess who is holding the elixir and the corpse,

227
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm sure they are related.

228
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I just made a bet

229
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
to let you steal the elixir.

230
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
As for what it does,

231
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I don't know.

232
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
What should we do next?

233
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
I've already put the same elixir

234
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
on the back of Lu Qianqian

235
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
as the real princess and the Six-Demon Star.

236
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Now you save Lu Qianqian

237
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
from the hands of Zhao Laosan and return to Changping.

238
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
When the fake Mistress

239
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
sees the elixir behind Lu Qianqian,

240
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
she will be shocked

241
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
and reveal her secret.

242
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Don't tell Lu Bu Ping

243
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
about what happened.

244
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I've played it.

245
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
You should die.

246
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Don't hurt me.

247
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
No.

248
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Don't hurt me.

249
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Don't hurt me.

250
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Sister.

251
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Sister.

252
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Are you okay, sister?

253
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Be careful, Ping.

254
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Are you okay?

255
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Don't touch me.

256
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
You bully my sister.

257
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
I'll give you a kiss.

258
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I'll give you a kiss.

259
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Don't hit me.

260
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
I...

261
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
I'll kick you!

262
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
You're so cruel.

263
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I'll hit you!

264
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Stop hitting me.

265
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I'll...

266
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
I'll give you a kiss.

267
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I'll give you a kiss.

268
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Sister.

269
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I'll kick you!

270
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
You're bullying my sister!

271
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Let's go.

272
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Let's go back to themişeming mansion.

273
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,940
Qing'er.

274
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,820
Qing'er.

275
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Qing'er.

276
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Where is she hurt?

277
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,660
Where is she hurt?

278
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,300
Don't touch me.

279
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,900
Tell the Queen Mother.

280
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,540
I'm here.

281
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:58,980
Qing'er.

282
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,500
Don't touch me.

283
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,980
Qing'er.

284
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,500
Don't.

285
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:00,980
Don't.

286
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Don't touch me.

287
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,740
