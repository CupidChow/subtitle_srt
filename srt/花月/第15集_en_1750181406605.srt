00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yue'er, are you okay?

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm fine. How about you?

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm fine, too.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hong Yue!

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hong Yue!

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hong Yue!

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Madam Chusen!

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hong Yue!

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm so sorry!

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Give me the sword.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Madam Chusen, didn't you just...

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was lucky just now.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I avoided the pursuit of the soldiers.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's the man.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you want to help Hong Yue?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Mr. Zhuge said

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we can't do anything

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
if we return to the capital again.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If we get hurt or die,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
it will affect us in reality.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't act rashly.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let go!

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Damn it!

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why is it a piece of wood?

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His Majesty ordered you

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to bring the seal to Changping City.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can take your time

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to read the rest of the story.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There is a six-star birthmark

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
on the back of Lu Qianqian's body.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a sign of the transformation of the eight stars.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Six-star?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's a jade.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
His Majesty said

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
it was given by the Manzu's Great Wu.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It contains the ancient forbidden spell,

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Blood Bone Stone Curse.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This Blood Bone Stone Curse

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
can seal the state-run spirit

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
of Changping City.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Changping City would have been

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
in a state of being.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Lu Qianqian

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
would have been killed.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm still wondering

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
why His Majesty

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
allowed me to dress like this

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and go to catch a baby.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He had put the Blood Bone Stone Curse

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
into the dragon vein of Changping City.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It can complete the human body.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Who knew that the wife of the master

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
would give birth to a star?

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The country has a star.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It protects the country and the people.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If I can't get rid of Lu Qianqian today,

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
the seal

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
won't play its real role.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a waste of time.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll find Lu Qianqian as soon as possible

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and get rid of him.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Master,

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the incense has been burnt for a long time.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They haven't woken up yet.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is there anything wrong?

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Before the incense is burnt out,

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you can use the Speed-return

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to make a tribute to the current emperor

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and answer the reality.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not the end yet.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
General Ye,

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
don't worry.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yu'er,

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I didn't expect

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you to be the star of Changping City.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's urgent.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
To get rid of the star,

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you must be in the Mid-Autumn Festival.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you can't do it today,

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you can only wait for the Mid-Autumn Festival

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
after 22 years.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Isn't it Tianyuan Eight Years

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
after 22 years?

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who?

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't worry.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will take good care of you.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't worry.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you ready?

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm ready.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It seems that he is still a master.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yu'er,

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
my power has recovered a few percent.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But I can't distract the soul

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
with the Purple Phoenix.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll attract their attention later.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hurry up.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Use the Speed-return

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that Mr. Zhuge taught you

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
to return to the reality.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What will you do?

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Lu Yi wants me to stay.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are just a dream.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hurry up.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Go quickly.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not a human.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Brother Qingming.

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Brother Qingming.

117
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Brother Qingming.

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
Wake up, Brother Qingming.

119
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
Wake up.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,040
Wake up.

121
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
What happened?

122
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
The mysterious man.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
The mysterious man is Lu Li.

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
We were found out.

125
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,560
Brother Qingming protected me and came back first.

126
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,880
He is still entangled with Lu Li and Mrs. Zhu.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
Brother Qingming, wake up.

128
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,360
Sir.

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,080
Sir.

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,080
What should we do?

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,080
I thought you were powerful.

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
It's just a strong end.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,680
You did this to trick that little girl to leave, right?

134
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,000
You forced her to break through the meridians.

135
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
You don't know what will happen.

136
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,720
She's gone.

137
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
She's still awake.

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,960
She won't wake up again, will she?

139
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
Mr. Zhuge.

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,200
This...

141
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
This is not a way.

142
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,280
S графThe so-called incense maybe

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,600
is just to signify enough energy in theuffled Apply시YMoon

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
The seated

145
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,640
was fed with the

146
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,500
broken piece of bone and white

147
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,120
The missingfull broken spirit

148
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,080
is the sisters of사� facilitation

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You never asked why the red color would spread in the middle of the winter.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's because it's the time when it's in the middle of winter.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because you still remember yourself.

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Who is it?

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Me.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I am the remnant of the winter emperor.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not a chance to exchange the past.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's just a chance to be in your hands.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Today, the young man is old.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The killer is still good.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Everyone is strong and strong.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I changed my name.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Little girl, why are you shaking your head?

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Isn't this good?

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There must be another way.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I must sacrifice you.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Sir.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Sir.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Sir.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sir.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Look, Qin Tian is still sitting there.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He's just in a dream.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's not awake yet.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There must be another way, right?

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sir.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sir.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Sir.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The Suhui Sword is an independent world.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's been three thousand years.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The Suhui Sword has its own rules.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I know.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The winter emperor is just a knot that connects the three worlds.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not that simple.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Little girl.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't worry.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I really think it's good.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I thought you two were reborn with the winter emperor.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm just an outsider.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now it seems that I'm the core of this story.

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm really happy.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Besides,

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
if I'm really a talent in the winter emperor,

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
it means I'm part of the ten great gods.

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This flower is no match for me in this life.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I finally beat him once.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Little girl.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Take good care of that flower for me.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay?

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Take good care of it.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Please.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to remember the moment we stopped at this moment.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's good for me to stop thinking about it.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to remember it for a thousand years.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're in another world.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hua Qingming.

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My name is Ye Weimin.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Remember me.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why am I같?

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know.

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
In fact.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because this is the right thing to do.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry, we broke up.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Mother!

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Mother!

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll wait for you

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll turn into a little sun in the hell

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Protecting you

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Kid, you're really dead

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The light of fate

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm afraid I can't see you

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm willing to be alone

242
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You Weiming, why are you here?

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Zi Meng, it's just a dream

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't believe I can't understand

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're too selfish

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The incense has been burnt out

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm afraid I can't go back

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Did you know who said the ghost?

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What are you talking about?

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
All right, you're here

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Thank you, thank you for giving me these things

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Qianming brother, you're back

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yue'er, what's wrong with you?

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm fine

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't want to

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't want to be in my hands

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Weiming brother

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm fine

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I love

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I just have a little pain in my heart

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't say

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't say

264
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
From now on, there is no Zhenbei King

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't tell me what happened

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't want to know

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yue'er, let's go

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We will find Tianqian

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The thing to deal with

270
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I did

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Since ancient times, Tianxu has been difficult

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The ordinary people are the only hope

273
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If you are so gorgeous

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Never forget

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The blood of the seven souls

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Red dust and rain

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You hide the dream

278
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Tears are not enough

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Missing like a branch through the night wind

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The story of the old dream

281
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Who will solve the grudge

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In the middle

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The night is lonely

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
A thousand years

285
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Long wind

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No end

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,320
Adorable

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,760
Flowing like a wind

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Sweet?

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you want to ask

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,120
Nothing

292
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Carol

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,860
The flower and the snow

294
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I wish this day will end

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
For you

296
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,960
Best

297
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,960
The yearning is like a dream, but the dream is not end.

298
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Love is like a dream, but the dream is not end.

299
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
The song of the song is like a poem,

300
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,960
the world is like a dream.

301
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,960
The fragrance is like a dream.

302
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,960
The song of the song is like a poem,

303
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,960
the world is like a dream.

304
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,960
The fragrance is like a poem,

305
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,960
the world is like a dream.

306
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
The fragrance is like a poem,

307
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,960
the world is like a dream.
