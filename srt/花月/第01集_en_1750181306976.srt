1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They said they would give me another chance.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to experience the most evil spirit.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's going on?

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where am I?

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Miss, we're home.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Chuan'er?

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Lu Li, I'm going to kill you!

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Eight Years of Heaven?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Didn't you get killed by Lu Li?

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you mean by Eight Years of Heaven?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now it's about six years.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We've come back from school.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Look, we're back at Prince Zhanbei's mansion.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Six Years of Heaven?

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Six Years of Heaven?

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
General, it's from Mr. Qian.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Qian,

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
there have been many traitors in the northern border.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Have you sent people to protect the border?

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll decide it after I discuss it with the City Leader.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If there's nothing else, you can leave for now.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Prince Zhanbei is in the bath.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He can't go in.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Move!

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hua Qingming,

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
why did you give up on Luori City?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why did you break the border?

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yue'er,

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I've been studying at Tianji Pavilion for three months.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't expect that I've grown up.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Miss Yue,

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm discussing military affairs with Prince Zhanbei.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Please come with me.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You must die today.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Luori?

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm here.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yue'er,

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
are you done?

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hua Qingming,

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you're going to pay for this!

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother Qingming,

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm here.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Brother Qingming,

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm here.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother Qingming,

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm here.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother Qingming,

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm here.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Brother Qingming,

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm here.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Give me a lantern.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Li Qianxue,

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
what are you doing?

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Lu Qianqian.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brother Qingming really asked me to do this.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother Qingming asked me to take his music

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to take your head.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My head?

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now,

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
do you believe me?

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Great!

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We can hang his head on the wall and exchange it for food.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We can survive!

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We can survive!

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We can survive!

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You!

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Li Qianxue,

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you dare to hit me!

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yue'er,

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you've had enough.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Lu Li,

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
take the princess back to her mansion.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Princess, please.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I...

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Li Qianxue,

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you're here!

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You bitch!

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let go of me!

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Li Qianxue!

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Li Qianxue!

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I forget how many times in the world

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
we have been together.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I miss your promise and your face.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I miss the time when you held my hand

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and walked through the years.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where is your home?

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's your name?

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't have a home

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or a name.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The moon is beautiful today.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The snow is big.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can call me Yue Qianxue.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why don't you come home with me?

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My home is your home.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Will you?

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Say something.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Didn't you say this is my home?

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Aren't you going to be my family?

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why do you want me to suffer in the sunset city?

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why do you want to break my food?

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why do you want to help me?

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why?

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why?

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why?

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You suffer in the sunset city and break your food.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yue'er.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
When did I tell you to guard the sunset city?

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The eight years of Tianyuan, the battle of Yiman.

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yiman was surrounded by the sunset city for three months.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The food was scarce in the city.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The people were in the way.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The living were helpless.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In the Central Plains,

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I gathered a man from the city

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to protect the people in the city.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I was seriously injured.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
My lady.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thanks to General Yue for protecting me for several months.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If it weren't for General Yue,

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
we would have been killed by these Man's people.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes. General Yue interrogated me.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
General Yue interrogated me.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
General Yue interrogated me.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
General Yue interrogated me.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
General Yue interrogated me.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My lady, are you okay?

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wu An.

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yue Jianxuan.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We told Man Wang that

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
as long as you hang your head on the wall of the city,

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
we will plant grass and feed it.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you don't die,

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
let the people of Chengcheng

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
die with you.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You came just in time.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't worry. Chang Pingjing won't give up on us.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yue Jianxuan.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Or you can just die.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What did you say?

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I said, Yue Jianxuan.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Or you can just die.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you die,

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
how many people can save us?

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No. I don't want to die.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You can die.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't want to die.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a critical time.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You should die now.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We can only live if you die.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to live.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We can't die.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We can't die.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We can't die.

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You.

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If it weren't for General Yue,

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you would have been...

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I risked my life to protect you.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You listened to the Man family's advice.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let me kill you.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yue Jianxuan.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Brother Qingming

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
also hopes that you can donate to the country.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Lu Qianqian.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do you mean?

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The north border is on fire.

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The ten months are over.

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Chang Pingjing has no reason to support it.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Brother Qingming and the Man family

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
have reached an agreement.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
As long as you, Yue Jianxuan,

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
give the head of the upper line

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to the Man family,

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
the Man family can be united.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Impossible.

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Three days ago, Hua Qingming also told me

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
that the food and food supplies

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
were going to be delivered to Luoricheng.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How could they be united at this moment?

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't be naive, Yue Jianxuan.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you hadn't made an agreement long ago,

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
how do you think I could have

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
entered Luoricheng safely?

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Lu Li.

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Lu Qianqian has disturbed the morale of the army.

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Take him down.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yue Jianxuan.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have been living for so many years.

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You must die today.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Lu Li.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going to fight with you.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Chang... Chang...

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yue Jianxuan.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't blame me.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It was really

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Brother Qingming who made me do it.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Brother Qingming, tell me.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If I really fight with Luoricheng,

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Chang Pingjing will never be able to stop me.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Will you come back to save me?

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I will.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, you won't.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You will still ask someone to take your moon shadow

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and cut off my head.

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yue'er.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why do you know

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that this sword is called the moon shadow?

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Of course I know.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Just two years ago.

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just today.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yue'er.

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I found a person in General Yue's relic.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yue'er.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yue'er.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm here to see you.
