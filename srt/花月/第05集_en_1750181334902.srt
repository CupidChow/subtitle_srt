The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yu'er, run!

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't leave you!

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You want to torture me?

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't worry.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I won't let you get away.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you okay, little flower?

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Brother Lin.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm dying.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Lu Li.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're so cruel.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come on.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The Legend of Chusen

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The Legend of Chusen

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yu'er.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I made your sword dirty.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The Legend of Chusen

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Brother Qingming.

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hua Qingming.

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hua Qingming.

29
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Brother Qingming.

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The Legend of Chusen

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I know it's your birthday today.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So I made a picture of the moon.

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't do a good job.

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yu'er will dislike it.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The moonlight shines in your eyes.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It flows into my heart.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The moon is hard to get into the deep tower.

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But you and I

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
are not afraid of the rain and the fire.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Day by day, I look at the moon.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hua Qingming.

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Although I'm a little annoying.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But you haven't taught me how to fly.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why are you...

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So sweet.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The Legend of Chusen

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't want any killing.

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I just want my moon sword.

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I seem to remember the moment that stopped.

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I can rely on you.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm still longing.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just want to look at you for a thousand years.

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are in another world.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A piece of love is broken.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The moonlight shines in your eyes.

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It flows into my heart.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But why is it that fate is not long?

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am a man of the world.

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I want to ask the life of the moon.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't want to lie to you.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't sleep for a thousand years.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Didn't you say you were going to be my family?

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Didn't you say you were going to be with me?

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Qingming.

65
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wake up.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wake up.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hua Qingming.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hua Qingming.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wake up.

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Wake up.

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Wake up.

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hua.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why didn't you say anything?

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Are you afraid?

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Afraid.

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Of course I'm afraid.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I only want to take the Changping Sword today.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And put it in the hands of the Xi Mu Kingdom and the Manzu people.

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll leave the back to you.

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll leave the back to you.

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hua Qingming.

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you regret anything?

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The thing I regret the most

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is that I couldn't go to the Fallen City

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to save Yue'er in Tianyuan for eight years.

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In General Yue's camp,

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I found a bell.

88
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go up.

89
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes.

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Go up.

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hua Qingming.

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm here to see you.

94
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Like Prince of Zhenbei,

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
he's brave, handsome and brave.

96
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He looks like the young prince.

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Anyway, he's pretty good.

98
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Our Changping City needs such a talent.

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a pity.

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a pity that in the future,

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
there's only me, the brave one.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Brother Qingming.

103
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Brother Qingming.

104
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I got it back.

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I got it back.

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I got it back.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ma Ying.

108
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ma Ying.

109
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The young princess is crying.

110
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't worry, young princess.

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I've surrounded you.

112
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No one will see you crying.

113
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Get out.

114
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Get out.

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You mean we're dead?

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

117
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In nine years,

118
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the new desert and the Manchurian people

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
have reached Changping Street.

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No.

121
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I saved Yue'er in the cave.

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Your Highness.

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How can you speak

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
like the first two people of Yue'er?

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now Yue'er

126
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
is the one who has been living in the Changping City

127
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
for two years.

128
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Born?

129
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No wonder Yue'er

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
said so many things

131
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that are hard to understand.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If so,

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yue'er is not

134
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the only one

135
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
who can save Yue'er.

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's why

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we can't let her go.

138
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yue'er died in the heaven for eight years.

139
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Your Highness.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The medicine is ready.

141
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I...

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You...

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You should say it first.

144
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're back.

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In the heaven for eight years,

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I never thought

147
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
that I would die.

148
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I didn't know

149
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that I would give up on you.

150
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't think

151
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that I would give up on Luo Risheng.

152
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's really you.

153
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But...

154
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But Lu Qianqian

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
came to me with your Yue'ing Sword

156
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and said that you wanted to take my food.

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You even asked her

158
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to use Yue'ing Sword

159
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
to kill me.

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yue'er.

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Will you believe what I said?

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
In the heaven for eight years,

164
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Man Ren and I

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
fought in the northwest.

166
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Who knew that

167
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the West desert

168
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
formed a alliance with Man Ren

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to take the northwest.

170
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The northwest was in danger.

171
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I had no way to escape

172
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
from Luo Risheng.

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I took all the food

174
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and handed the Yue'ing Sword to Lu Qianqian.

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Lu Qianqian

176
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and Lu Li helped Luo Risheng.

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But...

178
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But in the end,

179
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
they brought back the news of your death.

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I was so afraid

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that I would lose you.

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But I didn't want to lose you.

183
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So I killed Yue'er

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
to avenge the death of Luo Risheng.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't want to lose you.

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But I did.

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I did kill Yue'er

188
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
to avenge my death.

189
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I did kill Yue'er

190
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to avenge my death.

191
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I did kill Yue'er

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
to avenge my death.

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
