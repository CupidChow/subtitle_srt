00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Qian'er is quite frightened.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Take her back to her room to rest.

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We'll kill her and protect her.

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
City Leader,

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
please leave her to me.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Qianqian,

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Qian'er,

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
go back to your room to rest.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Go back to your room.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't be afraid.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Qianqian, come.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Go back to your room to rest.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't be afraid, Qian'er.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't be afraid.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Be quiet!

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't be afraid.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Go back to your room.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hua Qingming,

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you still dare to come to the City Hall.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're really bold.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Guards!

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
City Leader,

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it's Hua Qingming's credit

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
for finding the Princess this time.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please think twice.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, Father.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Although I proposed and implemented

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the plan to save her,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hua Qingming and Yue Xianxuan

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
also made a lot of efforts

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
in this plan.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And according to my investigation,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Lu Li has nothing to do with Hua Qingming.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I...

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Shut up!

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Qian'er,

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
how much skill and money do you have?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not sure.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have a few.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have to be a gold digger.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Humph!

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm willing to follow your order.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Please give me more time.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I will help Prince Zhenbei

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
to find out the truth about Lu Li's rebellion.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ye Weiming,

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you take my order

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
as a joke?

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't dare.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I have to be determined.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please show mercy.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please show mercy, Father.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Forget it.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Within three days,

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will not pursue the crime of Prince Zhenbei.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But after three days,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I will not find out the truth.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You have one day to count.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Take it away for a few days.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Father,

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you...

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You have to take your son to the heaven.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yue'er,

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we haven't been back to the Mansion of the Gu family for a long time.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Fortunately, things are going well now.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Indeed.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How dare you!

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Give up your old relationship!

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The fugitive Hua Qingming and Yue Qianxun

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
are all here to be sentenced.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Come back to the Mansion of the Gu family for punishment!

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Stop!

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yao Wei,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
it's late at night.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are not in the Mansion of the Gu family.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You should serve the City Leader.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You came to the Mansion of Prince Zhenbei to make trouble.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are you trying to break the law?

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The Mansion of the Gu family?

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I haven't been back for days

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to kill the two thieves.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ye Weiming,

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
don't do anything rash.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My official position is much higher than yours.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are quite good.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Young City Leader.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's wrong?

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The City Leader has no order.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He is not talking.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's my good deed to be the Young City Leader.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You!

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Give it to me.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Get lost.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This...

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This...

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is a toilet.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My father has let go.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You are still here to make trouble.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Get lost.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Get lost.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How is it?

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The Princess is fine.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She just suffered from a cold.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
She should be bathed with a small amount of fish and grass

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to get rid of it.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You two go and prepare it.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, Mistress.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Qingqian,

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
don't be afraid.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm here.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't be afraid.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm here.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Greetings, Mistress.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Your Highness.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
adorable

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Madam.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,460
stomach

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
videos

125
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,000
come from a falling5 complimentary

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Eunuch's mansion

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How could it be?

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Damn it, how could it be a piece of wood?

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
His Majesty ordered you to bring the seal to Changping City.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We will take the rest into consideration.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There is a six-star birthmark on the back of Lu Qianqian's body.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's the sign of the transformation of the eight-star.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Six-star?

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Six-star?

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The seal?

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right, the seal.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If I hadn't asked Madam in person,

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I would have been in a lot of trouble.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Madam has been in Changping City for decades.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's useless to be a fool to get information from her.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Besides...

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What?

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Madam is very anxious.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The man in black that was caught in the City Hall last time,

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
when I was interrogating him,

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Madam pretended to interrogate him,

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
but he was kidnapped by the man in black at a critical moment.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But the rope that tied the man in black

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
was obviously cut off with a knife.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And only Madam was there at the scene.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now it seems that Madam was trying to use my hand

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to kill him, silence him, and destroy evidence.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Madam is very thoughtful.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's almost impossible to get information from her.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If only I could find the mysterious man in Yueyuan's mouth.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The seal.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If the seal can help Yue'er and me come back,

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
if it can help us,

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
it will be back to the city for 45 years.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This...

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is not possible.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Who is it?

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
City Leader, it's me.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's Madam. Please come in.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's late.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What brings you here?

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think you've been too busy lately.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I made a pot of Lu'er tea.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And...

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That seal...

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know if you've kept it safe.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This seal...

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This seal...

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I went to see it just now.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know who took it.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's gone?

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The sacred item I gave you to protect the country and the country,

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you lost it?

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's not impossible.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's strange.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
How did the power of the Eastern Imperial School turn from gold to red?

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
About the incense...

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What do you mean?

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The one who quickly returns to the Eastern Imperial School

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
can indeed use it to burn the incense.

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll send it back to the capital for 45 years.

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But the current power of the Eastern Imperial School

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
is enough to burn the incense.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Time has passed.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If you can't return in time,

191
