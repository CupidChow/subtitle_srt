1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish to see you again.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wish to see you again.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wish to see you again.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I wish to see you again.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I wish to see you again.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I wish to see you again.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wish to see you again.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I wish to see you again.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I wish to see you again.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wish to see you again.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wish to see you again.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wish to see you again.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wish to see you again.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I wish to see you again.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I wish to see you again.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I wish to see you again.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I wish to see you again.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I wish to see you again.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I wish to see you again.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I wish to see you again.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I wish to see you again.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I wish to see you again.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I wish to see you again.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I wish to see you again.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I wish to see you again.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I wish to see you again.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I wish to see you again.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I wish to see you again.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Qingming.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Qingming.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Qingming.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
Hold on.

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Open the door!

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,080
Someone!

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Can you help me?

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,040
Open the door!

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Open up.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,040
Help me!

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,280
Please help me!

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,120
Open the door!

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,200
Open the door!

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,200
Open the door!

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
Half past six years especially.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Qingming, you must hold on.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
I'll take you back to the Prince of Zhenbei.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll definitely cure you

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,840
if I can't keep the medicine in the house.

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Hold on.

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,920
Qingming,

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,160
Qingming.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Qingming,

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Qingming,

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,240
Qingming,

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Qingming.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Qingming,

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,040
Qingming.

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
Qingming,

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,600
Qingming.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Qingming,

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,520
Qingming,

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,960
Qingming.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,000
Qingming.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Qingming.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,480
Qingming.

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
Boss Ma, no.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,440
Ming Ge was framed.

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
No.

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Step aside.

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Don't cry.

70
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,780
Let me make the difference of life

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,780
You...

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,980
Now there's a way back to the town.

73
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,780
I thought this place was safe.

74
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
I know a place.

75
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,140
Follow me.

76
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,380
My husband, you just recovered from your illness.

78
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
We haven't found out about this yet.

79
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,180
Don't panic.

80
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,580
My lady, it's late.

81
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,180
If there's nothing else,

82
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,180
you'd better go back to the Palace and rest early.

83
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,780
How is she?

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
She's fine.

85
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,380
She's just recovered from an injury.

86
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,380
She's not feeling well.

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,180
She needs to rest for a while.

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
She'll be weak for a while.

89
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,380
I'm afraid she can't move.

90
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,380
Little girl, do you remember this place?

91
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,580
It's familiar, but I can't remember where it is.

92
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Dongbi Academy.

93
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,380
That year, Hua Qingming and I started our plan here.

94
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
One day,

95
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,380
Hua Qingming went to see a little girl

96
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,380
under the tree outside the door.

97
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
Dongbi Academy

98
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,380
Why is it like this now?

99
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,980
My husband is disabled.

100
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
He's too shy to learn.

101
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
It's the year of the heaven.

102
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,980
It's said that my husband is a spy of the Western State.

103
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,780
He ordered the Feng Xue family to be confiscated.

104
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,380
My husband died.

105
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,380
Dongbi Academy,

106
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,580
the school,

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,380
and the seal.

108
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,780
Mr. Dongchuan is a spy of the Western State?

109
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Three years in the heaven,

110
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,180
I became a spy of the Shu Cheng Army.

111
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,980
Finally, I found out that

112
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,580
my husband was innocent.

113
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,380
He just saved a dead Xi Mu man

114
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,580
without knowing the truth.

115
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,380
But he was charged with treason.

116
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,180
Death.

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,180
I can't get used to this feeling.

118
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,980
Little girl,

119
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
you and Hua

120
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,780
have been acting strange lately.

121
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,780
What's going on?

122
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Can you tell me?

123
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,380
Brother Wei Ming,

124
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,580
do you believe in rebirth?

125
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Yes.

126
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
Xiaoqi,

127
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,980
can you stop walking around?

128
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,180
I'm so annoyed.

129
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,780
Aren't you walking around too?

130
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm walking around.

131
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm walking around because I'm worried about my lady.

132
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,180
Then I'm worried about my prince.

133
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,380
Prince Zhenbei is a good dancer.

134
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,980
He's the best in Changping.

135
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,380
There's no need to worry.

136
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,180
But my lady...

137
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,380
His Highness is good at martial arts.

138
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,780
But he was poisoned a few days ago.

139
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,980
He almost died.

140
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
Besides,

141
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,180
His Highness is protecting Miss Yue.

142
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,380
There's no need to worry.

143
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You're right.

144
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
His Highness loves my lady so much.

145
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,580
If His Highness is safe,

146
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,980
he won't be angry with my lady.

147
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm so envious.

148
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,180
You're envious.

149
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Miss Yue is really lucky.

150
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
You'll be in trouble in the next life.

151
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,380
Xiaoqi, come here.

152
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,780
Come here.

153
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Yao Wei?

154
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,780
Why are you here so late?

155
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Go.

156
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,580
This is Prince Zhenbei's mansion.

157
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,780
What do you want?

158
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,380
Take them back.

159
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,780
And interrogate them.

160
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,180
I'm his wife.

161
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,580
I'm just a little girl.

162
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,780
If anyone wants to catch me,

163
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,380
I'll be a little girl.

164
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,380
It's hard to say.

165
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
In this story,

166
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,780
I seem to be unnecessary.

167
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,380
Why do you say that?

168
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,580
The woman and I

169
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,780
have been fighting for nine years in Tianyuan.

170
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,780
But I have no so-called rebirth.

171
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,180
In this story,

172
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,180
I'm just a fixed number.

173
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,980
A fixed number that can't change the future.

174
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,980
I seem to be unnecessary.

175
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,780
We just have to stop all this from happening.

176
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,980
Isn't that enough?

177
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,580
The Afterlife story

178
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,780
It's dawn.

179
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,180
I should go back to Chengzhu Residence.

180
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,180
Don't worry.

181
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
Even if I don't have the money to reming,

182
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,380
I trust you all.

183
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,080
If there's really such a day...

184
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,780
Whatever.

185
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,380
As long as you believe me.

186
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,100
You didn't catch it?

187
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,340
Master.

188
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,300
Hua Qingming's Qinggong is above me.

189
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,260
I didn't catch it.

190
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,980
Hua Qingming is seriously injured.

191
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
And he got hit by my sword.

192
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,460
I didn't catch it.

193
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,580
Prince of Zhen Nan.

195
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,780
Hua Qingming is talented.

196
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,540
It's a little difficult for you to catch him.

197
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,580
You don't have to blame yourself.

198
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,940
I will do my best to avoid this from happening again.

199
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,260
Forget it.

200
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,500
Hua Qingming's followers, Xiaoqi and Chang'er,

201
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,980
have been sent to prison.

202
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,060
According to his character, he will come back to rescue.

203
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,500
At that time,

204
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,460
he will come to catch me.

205
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,380
I want to find out

206
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,180
why Hua Qingming betrayed me.

207
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,420
And why did you betray me?

208
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,500
Master.

209
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,460
I think Hua Qingming is loyal to Changping.

210
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,540
He won't do such a thing.

211
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,460
Enough.

212
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,980
Let's find out the truth.

213
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,740
Go back.

214
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,660
Yes.

215
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,780
Go.

216
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,980
Qingliu, you're awake.

217
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,340
I'll make you something to eat.

218
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Manchurian.

219
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,900
This is...

220
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,260
Dongbi Shuyuan.

221
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,140
Did you bring me here?

222
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,180
Brother Wei Ming brought us here last night.

223
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,180
I can't remember.

224
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,780
I just remember

225
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,460
we escaped from the City Hall last night.

226
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,060
Suddenly,

227
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,500
it was dark.

228
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,260
I couldn't remember anything.

229
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,020
I couldn't remember anything when it was dark.

230
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,500
It was A Yan's guy.

231
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,660
What should we do now?

232
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,220
We need to find out

233
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,260
what's the connection between Lu Li and Ximu Kingdom.

234
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,820
According to your situation after you were born,

235
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,380
Lu Li had a relationship with the princess.

236
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,540
So the princess is our only clue.

237
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,380
According to Lu Qianqian's personal maid,

238
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,780
since she helped you suck your finger,

239
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,140
you've lost your face.

240
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,820
I didn't suck my finger.

241
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,660
I was bitten by a snake.

242
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,140
And she suddenly sucked the venom out of my tongue.

243
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,740
You sucked it for her?

244
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,020
You didn't suck it yourself?

245
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,580
It was an emergency.

246
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,420
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,020
No, Yuan'er.

248
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,580
Why did you take it too far?

249
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,020
All right, I'm just kidding.

250
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,700
The priority now is to find missing Lu Qianqian.

251
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,500
Where can we find her?

252
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,180
It seems

253
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,420
we need to find Zhuge Renfeng.

254
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,420
Gentlemen,

255
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,500
we shouldn't have come here

256
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,500
to talk about the martial arts.

257
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,460
But you fell into the trap and disappeared.

258
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,780
Savior told me

259
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,180
that Lu heading to issue a decree

260
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,420
is the last thing I know.

261
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,100
But I was too lazy

262
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,260
to read it,

263
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,940
so I didn't know the later date.

264
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,220
The moment of death

265
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,580
located in Chengzhi River

266
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,300
is very important.

267
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,020
Even the best medicine

268
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,780
can cure Ledle.

269
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,780
If sell this brush,

270
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,420
a person

271
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,580
If you can drink three cups with him,

272
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,380
you can make three movements.

273
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,380
His family will be in a state of chaos.

274
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,380
Brother Qin Ming, have you finished?

275
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
It's been an hour.

276
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,380
Wait a minute.

277
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Wait a little longer.

278
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,220
Haoyue Tr Spot

279
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:24,300
I want to see the world...

280
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,680
Like the wind...
