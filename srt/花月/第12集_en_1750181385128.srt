The Legend of Chusen

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Yun'er, why did you do this to me?

4
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Do this to you?

5
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you know how desperate I was when I died in Luo Rui City?

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Brother Qingming, I trusted you so much.

7
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Do you know how desperate you were when you killed me?

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yun'er, it's not like that.

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,000
It's not like that.

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Really?

11
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
If you love me,

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
why don't you

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
tear it apart now

14
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,000
and let me see if it jumps for me?

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is that okay?

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey, why are you still standing here?

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Come out!

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

20
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Brother Qingming,

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
no matter what I see in front of me,

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
in my heart,

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I believe you will never hurt me.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No matter what, I won't hurt you.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother Qingming,

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
don't forget me.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How to grow up?

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There are some things that can't be grown up.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The smile is like a soul,

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the only me

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
still loves you.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But it's wandering.

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yun'er,

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I made you suffer so much.

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But I...

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you know

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that it's not true?

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I also know

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that you will never hurt me.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Even if it's true,

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I know

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that even if you want to live,

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I will never hurt you.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I love you.

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Brother Qingming.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yun'er.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother Qingming.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you want to climb up the mountain,

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
climb up the mountain with me.

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you don't come out,

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I will become Lu Puping.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lu Puping,

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
did you bring the talisman?

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Talisman? What talisman?

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The wind of the earth.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The wind of the earth?

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Didn't you say that you can't use it to blow the ghost?

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why should I use it?

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I threw it away.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When we just touched the talisman,

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
we both fell into the environment.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think the talisman is used for this.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You mean

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to take away the talisman

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and use the wind of the earth?

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If I knew it, I wouldn't have thrown it away.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yi...Yi Weiming?

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
According to what the people of Zhuge said,

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the talisman should be in the hands of Taoist Weichen.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This person was born in Tianji Pavilion.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He said he was concerned about Hong Chen

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and left a few months ago.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The whereabouts are unknown.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then the clue is broken.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's put it aside for now.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Since the wind of the earth has already been blown,

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we should be able to find the talisman.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If we can't find it,

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
we can't find the talisman.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's put it aside for now.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Since the wind of the earth has already been blown,

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the most important thing is to go to Yue Yong

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and get the news of the princess.

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Wait.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This thing is so magical.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It can make people enter the illusion.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And my father

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is so proud of my mother.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I won't investigate anymore.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Lu Buping,

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
don't you want to know the news of the princess?

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My sister?

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Of course I'm anxious.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If we knew the news of the princess earlier,

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
she would be safer.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think Brother Qingming is right.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If we delay for an hour,

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the princess will be in danger.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's more important to go to the Fallen Hall

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and get the news of Lu Qianqian.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As for the talisman...

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A Yan.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes?

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Among us,

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you're the best.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
While Yue Yong is not ready,

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you can steal it back.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you mean by stealing it back?

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Since you're ready,

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
let's go to the Fallen Hall.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll get you a dress now.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Lu Buping,

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
get me some rouge

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and change Brother Qingming's makeup.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Master,

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
according to your order,

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I've asked Zhao Laosan to do it.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Zhao Laosan is so easy to deal with.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Master,

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is it inappropriate

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to ask Zhao Laosan to do it?

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They're not good people anyway.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It depends on luck.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
By the way,

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
prepare some wine.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We have a guest coming.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, Master.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Wait.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go and help me clean it.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The Fallen Hall

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sister,

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you're here.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're so good.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You've been looking for this seal

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
for less than two days.

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sister...

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Sister,

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
since you've brought this seal,

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
can you tell me

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
where the princess is?

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No hurry.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Look at my little sister.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She's so thin.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Since you're here,

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
why don't you chat with me?

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Where is your sister from?

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think the hairpin on your head

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
is quite pretty.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It looks like a rich girl.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm afraid it's not

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
from the princess.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sister...

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sister...

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sister...

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Lu Bu Ping,

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you're making her

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
even more scared.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
See?

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She's scared.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sister...

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sister.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sister.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't have the habit of answering questions.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Little sister is good at fighting.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a pity that you don't have the inner strength.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Sister.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Little sister.

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Little sword.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Prince Zhen Nan's name.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Cut the crap.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Wait.

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Chief Yue.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is your personal jade pendant.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're pretty fast.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Give it back to me.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who are you?

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is my personal jade pendant.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm willing to give it back to you.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Madam.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,760
According to the

183
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
report, the child in your belly

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is the star of the Heaven Book.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He is the father of my Changping Jing.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In the future,

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you must be more careful.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't be too hasty.

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Or you'll have trouble giving birth.

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thank you for your advice.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hong Yue.

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hong Yue.

193

I'm here.

This is the best tea this year.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The City Leader asked me

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to bring it to Mr. Zhuge.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000

Yes.

00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Your hand is so cute.

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Your hand is not in the right position.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can teach me like this.

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000

Not long.

I brought you your favorite garden.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You're lying.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Your umbrella is so thick.

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
my parents gave me this.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm willing to

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
unlock it for you.
