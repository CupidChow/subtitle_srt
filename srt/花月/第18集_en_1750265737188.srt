1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid I'll be too cruel

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a man of my word

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm not a man of my word

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not a man of my word

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not a man of my word

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not a man of my word

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not a man of my word

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm a man of my word

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not a man of my word

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not a man of my word

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not a man of my word

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Inside

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Inside

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's Madam Chu

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Madam Chu

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
She's dead

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Dead?

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Madam Chu

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Lu Qianqian

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, Madam Chu

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What should I call you?

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It doesn't matter

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're so impatient

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Where are you going?

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What did you say?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't understand

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Brother Bu Ping

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Brother Bu Ping

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Brother Bu Ping

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's him

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's the woman who kidnapped me

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They're together now

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They must have discussed

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They want to get together

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You should save me

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Who are you?

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're really my sister

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm Qianqian, Brother Bu Ping

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Look, I'm Qianqian

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Did you say

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
you made a mistake?

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The one who died

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
is the real mother

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think she's the same as my sister

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She's fake

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's also a victim

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Brother Bu Ping

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I really don't know anything

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm also a victim

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She's not Qianqian

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Father

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't figure out

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
the red ring she's wearing

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When Madam Yu came back

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I didn't have any red ring

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I asked her

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
for this

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Madam

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you still remember?

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Now

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you believe it, right?

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You killed me before you came back

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You killed me before you came back

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's me

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I didn't expect

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I couldn't kill you

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
when I came back with the ring

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not necessary

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Great

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We can eat her head

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
in the city

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and we can live

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We can live

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and we can eat

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We can eat her head

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How do you know

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yue Qianqian is the real princess?

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Before the war

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
she was so close to me

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I saw her

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I didn't expect

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
she's twenty years old

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She came to me

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then why

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
changed to Lu Qianqian?

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why?

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If I don't change her face

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
how can Prince Li

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
let me go into Luoyin City?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The Longan of Changping Capital

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
is in Luoyin City

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Today

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is the day

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
of the Longan of Changping Capital

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't worry

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
His Majesty said

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
as long as you complete the mission

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you will be the emperor

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lu Li

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
His Majesty said

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I didn't expect

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I came back

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
in the sixth year of the heaven

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Since I knew

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
my own background

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I planned to save myself

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I arranged for a black man to bury you

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I wanted to take a black man

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to Lu Li

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't expect

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hua Qingling caught her

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't expect

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't expect

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hua Qingling caught her

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hurry up, eat me first

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then you can go out

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hurry up

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hurry up

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Help

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Help

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hurry up

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hurry up, help

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Later I arranged for Lu Li to bury you

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I also wanted to take off

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hua Qingling's hand

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Who thought

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Lu Li was also removed

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But I didn't expect

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I wanted to complete my mission

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but it became more and more difficult

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Later I realized

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ye Qianxu

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You also reborn

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Since your purpose is to destroy the Longan of Changping Capital

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then why did you let me lose my life

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
when you poisoned the black man

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why didn't you poison the City Leader at that time?

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Second Yu Zai

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Even to complete a ridiculous mission

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But what wrong did I do

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that I didn't have a single love for my father

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Forget it

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Everything is over anyway

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Theitten thread

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
City Leader

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Princess

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want to ask you.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If I die,

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
will you miss me?

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is there such a love

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for me?

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Even if I die like this?

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I love you.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are my wife.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
My real wife

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is not that face.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I love you.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Your Highness.

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Your Highness.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Your Highness.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ping'er.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Be mature.

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
From now on,

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Changping Capital

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
will be yours.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I love you.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Your Highness.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your Highness.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Changzhu.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Changzhu.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Changzhu.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Changzhu.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Changzhu.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Changzhu.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Changzhu.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Changzhu.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Changzhu.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Changzhu.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The North Route of Wei Yuan Army is not full.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The command of the army is not enough.

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The new army has sent a message to Changping Capital.

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's very scary.

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Very scary.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If there is nothing,

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
just leave.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the army of Shu Cheng came to report

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that two people came to Changzhu.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It should be

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Prince Zhenbei and Yue Qian Xue Yue.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What did you say?

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Prince Zhenbei and Yue Qian Yue?

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Where is it?

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Take me to see them.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's been so many years.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Finally, I come back.

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Brother Qin Ming.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The Central Plain Festival in Changping Capital

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is still hot.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's been ten years.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If the atmosphere is too bad,

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I didn't think that Lu Buping's guy

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
would be so good in Changping Capital.

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Look at the lantern.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is it the same as the one we had?

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yue is the same as the one we had.

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come here.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Be careful.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Be careful.

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Be careful.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Look, you hit someone again.

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sorry.

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He is too reckless.

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But he has no pleasure.

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Sorry, brother is so scared of you.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Come.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I give you this.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you.

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I apologize to you

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
for being so rude.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's go.

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's go.

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's go.

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.
