00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yue'er

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Speak, Yue'er

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yue'er

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yue'er

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm here

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yue'er

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you doing, idiot?

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's time to pay your respects

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yue'er

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Brother Qiming, save me

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Brother Qiming

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Save me

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yue'er

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yue'er

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yue'er

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yue'er

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What are you doing, my lord?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are you doing, my lord?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My lord

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My lord, you're awake

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're awake, my lord

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Lord Zhen, our lord is awake

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How long did I sleep?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
About two hours

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Two hours

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Two hours

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yue'er

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yue'er

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yue'er

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Where is Yue'er?

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She was taken away in front of you

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How dare you ask her?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How dare you ask her?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can call me Qianxun from now on

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can call me Qianxun from now on

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you all right?

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm fine

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's not just the poison in my body

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not just the poison in my body

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's something left

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The bamboo forest in Changpingjing

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where did the bamboo leaves come from?

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Zhu Bishan

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There are only bamboo forests near Changpingjing

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Zhu Bishan

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Zhu Bishan

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Zhu Bishan

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're awake

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There are only bamboo forests near Zhu Bishan

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Zhu Bishan

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where is Zhu Bishan?

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a five-mile journey from the west to the south

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I used to go there a lot when I was a soldier

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Wait

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Zhu Bishan is 800 meters high

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Huayang is 3000 meters high

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Zhu Bishan is hundreds of meters high

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If you search, you can't find it in ten days

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't stop looking

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Only the long-term wind and the cave in the back

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The plant will form this kind of

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The state of the pulse is lost and yellowed

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
According to my experience as a soldier

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Zhu Bishan is in the northwest corner

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There are a few caves that fit this kind of feature

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Your body is poisoned and your tongue is not recovered

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll go

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you crazy?

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're now out of the vital channels

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You will die

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why don't you go home with me?

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
My home is your home from now on

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're crazy

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't fall asleep

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm afraid that the dream will be broken

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm willing to face it again

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm willing to face it again

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm willing to face it again

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The moonlight is in your eyes

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There are letters in my heart

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't stop talking to you

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't stop talking to you

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The moonlight is in your eyes

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There are letters in my heart

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't stop talking to you

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Brother Qingming, tell me

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If I really read the diary

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Changping Jing has no more original

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Will you come to save me?

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Will

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ye Qianxun

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can't get out of this ghost gate today

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yan Siqian

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll make you regret it soon

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yan Siqian

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yue'er, I'm here

99
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Prince of Zhenbei, I'm wrong

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Forgive us, Prince of Zhenbei

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Prince of Zhenbei, forgive us

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Prince of Zhenbei

103
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Prince of Zhenbei was poisoned

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Even if I'm poisoned

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I can still kill you

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Prince of Zhenbei

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Prince of Zhenbei

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Changping Jing has been rotten

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
As long as Yueqian Xue dies

110
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Changping Jing is the world of our Xi Mu State

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to be a head

112
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hua Jingming

113
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Look

114
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yueqian Xue is dying or the master's body

115
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Or you look at me

116
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Help him complete this regret

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I want to be like a dream
