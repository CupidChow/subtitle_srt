1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish to see you again.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wish to see you again.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wish to see you again.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I wish to see you again.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I wish to see you again.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I wish to see you again.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I wish to see you again.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I wish to see you again.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I wish to see you again.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wish to see you again.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wish to see you again.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wish to see you again.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wish to see you again.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I wish to see you again.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Justwind

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
pensando

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
m.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is good.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me tell you a story.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's see if it's the right time.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll sneak into the City Hall first.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then we'll enter the City Hall

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and find something called a local card.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then I'll cover you and leave the City Hall.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Here, I have two questions.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Go ahead.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
First,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hua Qingping, you have such a high martial arts.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You want to enter the City Hall,

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you just need to step on it and fly in.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why do you want me to cover you?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My tongue poison and injury have not been cured.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't have any strength.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't use my qinggong.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, I see.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Second,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
what does this local card look like?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What is it for?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your question is not simple.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Most people who come to me for information

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
are looking for treasure and exploration.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I really met the princess for the first time.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What does the Chief of the Music Hall mean?

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You want to break your own rules.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not about breaking the rules.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But I don't have an accurate answer to this question.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But it's not that you can't solve it.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There is a thing called a local card in the City Hall.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This thing has a big connection with the princess' identity.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you can get this local card,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the princess's problem will be solved.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, as long as you find the local card,

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
it's like finding Lu Qianqian.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Find my sister?

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's reliable.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So your first task is to cover us

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
from entering the City Hall.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not going to let you go.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to protect you.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to protect you.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're going to cover us from entering the City Hall.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What? Is it difficult?

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Difficult?

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who can't you look up to?

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I know everything.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I know everything.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay. Tell me.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I really know a good place.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yu'er, be careful.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is the good place you said?

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You don't understand.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When I was a kid,

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
this City Hall wasn't a place for a walk.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I just walked through this hole.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's like a mirrorless world.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where are you?

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yu'er, are you okay?

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Qinglin, why isn't the Crown Princess here yet?

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Lu Bu Ping.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Lu Bu Ping.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Lu Bu Ping.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Lu Bu Ping.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Lu Bu Ping.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lu Bu Ping.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Lu Bu Ping.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You two! What are you doing?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Lower your voice.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who?

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh no, someone spotted us.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let me go and take a look.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Li Yanjun.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Li Yanjun.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm not going.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What are you doing?

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you doing?

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are so fat

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How dare you to stand in front of me

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and cut your head off

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I am not fat

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I am not fat

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How dare you to stand in front of me

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and cut your head off

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I will cut your head off

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I am not fat

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please forgive me

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Not fat?

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think you are not fat

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How dare you to recognize me

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I just saw

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
there are many people here

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
who think they are the real ones

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Bullshit

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How dare you to say that I look like a thief

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I look like a thief

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I look like a thief

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I look like a thief

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will cut your head off

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will cut your head off

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will cut your head off

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Good, Hua Chengyu

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You are so cruel

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh no

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think I am going to die

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yu'er

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Be careful

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You will die easily

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What can I do for you, uncle Shao?

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Nothing

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I have been studying the four books and five scriptures

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and the ancient books of the Spring and Autumn War

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have been working so hard

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Uncle Shao, your nose blood

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I have been so tired recently

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am going out to relax

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Relax

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Relax

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I am going to exercise

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and I am going to kill myself

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's it

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I slipped and fell

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I will get you a doctor

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No need

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No need

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I am just a stick

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What can I do for you?

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Look

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will give you another one

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He is coming again

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Three

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Two

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
One

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Jump

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Anyway

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I am not going to die

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I will die

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Not going to die

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's okay

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I am going to exercise

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If there is nothing else

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can continue your tour

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will go back to the bedroom to rest

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Dadao

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What can I do for you, uncle Shao?

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Give me your little sister

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Please

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Give it to me

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Go

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Such a delicate little mirror

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have never had it

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What a big thing

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's better than me

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Lu Wuying

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You are so bad

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And you have a leg

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You two

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Why did you hide?

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
My legs are almost broken

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You kicked us

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why didn't we hide?

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You two

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You just hit Wu Yanqing

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I kicked you

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You shouldn't

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are so good

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You didn't get in through the hole

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You have to hide behind us

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are not a runaway

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I am so good at breaking holes

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why should I break holes?

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I am not a thief

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I am a big door

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Close the door

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is the armor warehouse of our City Hall

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
My father and mother

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Usually put the books and books

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In the box

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All hidden here

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That envelope

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's possible to be here

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do you mean?

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You two don't point your head at me

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You don't take me seriously

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Is it a group?

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Go

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You think I am a good person?

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I will go to the place to find the envelope

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Luo Fuping

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What are you doing?

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What are you afraid of?

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I just think this place

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Is quite sinister

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Come

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I will put it on you

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is a spiritual talisman

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Not on the street

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's painted on the street

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Come

227
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Stop it

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Stop it

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Stop it

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Greetings, Madam Chu

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you have any strange news?

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If I have a score, everything is normal

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Madam Chu, please

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Someone came to the price shop

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mother, why are you here?

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ping'er

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mother

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't know why you came to the price shop at night

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Mother should ask you this

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why didn't you rest in the bedroom at night?

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why did you go to the price shop?

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Ping'er

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Not flat

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Not flat

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I always feel that wasting time today

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a waste of life

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Waste of life

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Not flat

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
A day and night

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I want to seek knowledge

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And a higher pursuit of this world

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Mother, look

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
My five eyes

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, the dark circles

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Is the state of staying up late to read

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is this true?

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Of course it's true

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How dare you lie to mother?

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Madam Chu

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The Crown Princess is really hard

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was looking around in the mansion just now

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm tired of reading books

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm still practicing for the competition in the mansion

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then mother, look

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What are you doing?

272
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The combination of pig's confident and meat

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And technical improvement

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mother

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't think that

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This combination of pig's skies is a small matter

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In the future, I want to be the City Leader

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The first thing is

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I consider our people in Changping

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Can I eat?

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can I eat meat?

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is my life

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Mother, you're right.

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's reasonable.

285
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Mother, you should take one too.

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Go back and study the people's lives.

287
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Mother, I've already started studying the people's lives.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you studying?

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Red dust and mist, you're hiding in your dream

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm not crying

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Missing you like a branch through the night

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The story of the old dream, who will solve the grudge

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The night is lonely, the thousand years are long and the wind is heavy

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,500
The

295
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,000
Love just sectors

296
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THE

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I want to be with you

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to be with you

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to be with you

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I want to be with you

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I want to be with you

302
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I want to be with you

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I want to be with you
