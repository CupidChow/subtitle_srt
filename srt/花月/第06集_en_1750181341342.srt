1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,240
In the minister's eyes,

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:19,520
the

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,680
light of the faith

5
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,720
Wanqing,

6
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,520
it seems that I lost many years of experience.

7
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,800
Being dweller.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:52,200
She has macam

9
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,720
her face.

10
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,040
Why are you digging so sweet?

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,880
I need to rest recently.

12
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
I told you not to move.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,360
Why are you so disobedient?

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,680
Come on.

15
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,120
I want to be a woman.

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,800
I'll do it myself.

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Be good.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
I forgot some of the clarified soup.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Are you okay?

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
What's wrong?

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,800
Are you crying about the clarified soup?

22
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Yeah, I think

23
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
it's good.

24
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,440
It is boiled round.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,880
I continue to eat教 GOD.

26
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,000
He soon proves that it is not the wrong thing I do.

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,680
I knew you were really back alive.

28
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,280
I had so many nights in this scene.

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
So many nights of regret.

30
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,280
Now it's true.

31
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Since God gave us another chance,

32
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,880
we must find out the truth behind the battle.

33
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
To stop this war.

34
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
When it's all over,

35
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,880
I want to be with Qin Ming forever.

36
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,080
In a world out of the world,

37
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,680
with a life-and-death syndrome.

38
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,880
Okay?

39
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
Okay.

40
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,880
I promise you.

41
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,080
But now,

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
we need to know

43
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,280
why there are so many people in this world.

44
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
And Lu Qianqian.

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
What Lu Qianqian?

46
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
You two are getting along so well.

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,080
Little girl,

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
you forgot the other day

49
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
when he bullied you.

50
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,080
Stop it.

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Tell me.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,880
What do you want from me?

53
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,280
There are little Lord Wei,

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
hiding from me.

55
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
They wouldn't believe

56
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
the свторlio árboga

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,480
would crowd Lu's house.

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,320
Hurry, your Lordship is sick.

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
You'd better wear clean clothes

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
to the royal preached room.

61
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,680
You still have to summon

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Zhenbei King and Mas ordering the election.

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,680
Lu Li's body is completely transferred back to the doeside.

64
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
I want to talk with you.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,480
I'll ask her

66
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,680
if they have any new clues.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,980
Hold on.

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,080
I'll go too.

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Let's go together.

70
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
You can't go?

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,880
Young Master, what do you mean?

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
My father recovered.

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,680
I asked him to invite Yue Qianxue personally.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
He said he saved his life.

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
He will be rewarded.

76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
And you, Prince Zhenbei.

77
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
You are Yue Qianxue's family.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
You should go with him.

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I won't be here any longer.

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,680
I'm leaving.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,680
I hate it when my father praises others in front of me.

82
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
How humiliating!

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll go with you to investigate the case.

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,280
You?

85
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
What does this mean?

86
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
You are here alone.

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,880
You are here day and night.

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,480
I won't help you.

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
I'll be lost.

90
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm here.

91
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
You two, go to the City Hall.

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
Don't let my father wait too long.

93
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,080
There is no car.

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
I'm leaving.

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Miss Yue'er.

96
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
If your medical skills were not good,

97
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm afraid I would be in trouble.

98
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm not a good woman.

99
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
If you didn't trust me,

100
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm afraid I would have wasted time.

101
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,680
Then the reward for today should be yours.

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,080
I always think that Miss Yue'er is blessed.

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
So I agreed to treat you.

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,080
I hope you won't blame me.

105
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,680
Why do you say that?

106
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
You did the right thing.

107
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
That's right.

108
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,080
Why should I be guilty?

109
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,280
But in this world,

110
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
the reward will be rewarded.

111
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
That day,

112
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,680
you two were working at my bedroom door.

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Yes.

114
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Good.

115
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Then you two talk about the punishment.

116
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
I'm the criminal.

117
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm the criminal.

118
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm the criminal.

119
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm the criminal.

120
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm the criminal.

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm the criminal.

122
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm the criminal.

123
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm the criminal.

124
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm the criminal.

125
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Get up.

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Get up.

127
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,480
Look at you.

128
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Am I that scary?

129
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
What?

130
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
So,

131
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
the punishment

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
is still going to be punished.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Yes.

134
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
By the way,

135
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,480
I heard that Qianqian has been fond of Prince Zhenbei for many years.

136
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,280
And she likes to have fun.

137
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,680
How about this time,

138
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
she will arrange the reward?

139
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Lu Buping, what are you doing?

140
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,480
Call me the chief.

141
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,280
Let me prepare.

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,480
Here, I'll give you a kiss.

143
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Go.

144
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,880
You...

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
You think you're Liu Ganfei?

146
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
You're so timid.

147
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Why do you have to follow me?

148
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,680
You're lying.

149
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm timid.

150
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm not afraid of anyone.

151
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,280
I'm not afraid of anyone.

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Oh my god.

153
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Oh my god.

154
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Please forgive me.

155
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,280
I'll be the chief in the future.

156
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,880
What did I think it was?

157
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Come on.

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
Qing is gone.

159
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,760
I...

160
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,400
幾日都沒見過郡主.

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Kaidi.

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Ship down.

163
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
Last time.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
only after watchingnya

165
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
until she disappeared.

166
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,080
Greetings, City Master and Madam.

167
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,400
Father,

168
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,360
the child is tree of great joy this time.

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,420
Woo me

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Get.

171
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,620
Ping'er.

172
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,000
Look at this picture here.

173
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,380
Yes.

174
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,100
How did you know?

175
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,260
I...

176
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,740
Just say it.

177
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,180
The assassin who assassinated the City Leader

178
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,340
had this tattoo on his neck.

179
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,420
And the assassin had the token of the West Mu State.

180
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,060
Prince Zhenbei.

181
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,380
Lu Li is your father.

182
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,140
How do you explain this?

183
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
City Leader.

184
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,660
I don't know.

185
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,340
You don't know?

186
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,300
Prince Zhenbei.

187
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,100
You think you can get away with this

188
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,180
just because you don't know?

189
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,140
Why?

190
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,620
It seems that

191
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,300
you won't get the reward today.

192
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
As for the punishment...

193
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,620
Ye Weiming, take his tiger tally.

194
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,020
City Leader.

195
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,260
Ye Weiming.

196
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
Ye Weiming.

197
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,220
City Leader.

198
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,060
I will find out the truth.

199
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,460
Prince Zhenbei.

200
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,220
Do you think you can find out the truth?

201
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,780
Didn't you say you would reward me?

202
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,780
Can you give Brother Qinling a few days

203
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,300
to investigate this matter?

204
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,300
Miss Ye.

205
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,620
Do you think you have a say here?

206
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,340
Guards.

207
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,820
Take him down.

208
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,860
Huge

209
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,460
The world is full of grudges

210
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:28,460
The lonely night is long and endless

211
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,460
The sound of the flute is like the wind, the sound of the flute is like the wind

212
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Love and hate are just a moment of emptiness

213
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Flowers, blood, moon, and sunset are all mixed together

214
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,460
Who will the fate of fate be for

215
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:01,460
The six years are fleeting like a dream, but I am not ashamed

216
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Love is also a moment of separation, but not ashamed

217
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,460
The song of separation is the song of separation

218
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,460
The world is full of grudges

219
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,460
The sound of the flute is like the wind, the sound of the flute is like the wind
