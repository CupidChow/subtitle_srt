1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I am afraid that I will be lonely

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I am willing to go through thousands of miles

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to go through the coldest of seasons

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am willing to fly to the future without any fear

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't want to ask who I am thinking about for the rest of my life

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know who I am meeting with

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I am willing to go through the long journey without any fear

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yue'er

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Brother Qingming, what sword is this?

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's so beautiful

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This sword is called the Moon Flower

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This sword is called the Moon Shadow

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I asked someone to make these two swords in the Sky Hall

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This time you returned from Tianqi Pavilion

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think you will definitely be on your side in the future

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When the time comes, I will be gone

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will be the one who will be by your side

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Moon Flower

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Moon Flower

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This time I don't want the Moon Flower

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want the Moon Shadow

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am the only one who can save me

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will tell you everything about Miss Long Yu and the incident in the room

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Little girl, you are so nosy

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I am here to see you off

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Apologize to me

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yue'er

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are so good

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I asked my little brother to come and catch you

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you let my little brother apologize to a maid

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Prince Zhenbei, you really didn't make me angry

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's wrong with you?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Take her away

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You don't like Prince Zhenbei that much

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What about me, Prince Zhennan?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yi Wei Ming, what Prince Zhennan?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you have the ability, let my father award you Prince Zhen Shao Cheng

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He will be against you

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Master's order

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't know him, do you?

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ok

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait for me to go to the city

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wait for me

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait for me

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Really

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Little girl, long time no see

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hua Qingming

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hua Qingming

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hua Qingming

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hua Qingming

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Who is this little girl?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Her name is Yue Qian Xue

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Little girl, let's go

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Brother Wei Ming will take you to the Hanoi meeting

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yue'er

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Prince Zhennan has the city's order

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Prince Zhenbei doesn't

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can't speak well

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Isn't the city's order easy to use?

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't worry

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother Wei Ming, let's go

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother Hu Ping

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How did you promise her?

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your sister, my face

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is it still burning in my face?

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When did Prince Zhennan come back?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He even took my father's collar

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So annoying

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What are you doing?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Your sister, I'm bullied

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are so willful to watch

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sister Qian Qian, don't worry

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When you don't judge my brother as the city's leader

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I will kill them

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Young City Leader

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is the top body you ordered me to prepare for the city's leader

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Should I send it over now?

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Good

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will do it myself

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What about my business?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will do it now

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Little girl, let me tell you

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The Tegu Army is really weak

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Brother Wei Ming is so fierce

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He beat them to death

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He swore not to do it again

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And he lost countless treasures

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Look

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When the city's leader was happy

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He gave me the city's order

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In the past three years

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My martial arts have been very good

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The girl named Hua

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She is definitely not my opponent now

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will have a good competition with her when I have time

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Little girl

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Little girl

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Little girl

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Little girl

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Is it good?

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Good

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yu'er is the most beautiful

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For you

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Little girl

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ignore this girl

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Brother Wei Ming will take you to play something fun

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wait

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is suitable for you

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Take it

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where are you going?

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's better

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can't you listen to me once?

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't want

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Brother Qi Ming and I are family

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Little girl

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why?

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not happy?

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is it because of the girl named Hua?

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait for me

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hua Qingming

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yue Qianxuan

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't think you can see the red dot

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And that

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There is a bird

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Young master

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did you find out that there was a black man passing by?

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Black man?

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I saw him

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I saw him

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I saw him

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I saw him

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I saw him

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I saw him

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I saw him

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I saw him

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I saw him

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I saw him

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I saw him

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I saw him

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I saw him

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I saw him

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I saw him

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I saw him

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Black man

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Aren't you a black man?

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait for me to see my father

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I won't tell you

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'd better walk over

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'd better walk over

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Say it

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What do you want?

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wei Niu

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What are you doing here?

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Just in time

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You wait for me

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Father

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I brought you something good

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Little head

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Did you find it?

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Flew away

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What's wrong with you?

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What's wrong with you, father?

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm coming

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Stand still

176
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,000
SEE ME

177
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,000
Hurry up

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
Hurry up.

179
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you okay?

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
Can you stand up?

181
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Chief, I've never seen such an emergency.

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm really helpless.

183
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
I have a way.

184
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
You?

185
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
The most famous doctors in the city have never seen such an emergency.

186
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
You have a way? What can you do?

187
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Why don't you try it?

188
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Mother.

189
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I think Miss Yue'er's spirit energy

190
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,000
doesn't look like a evil person.

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If she has a way,

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
why don't you let her try it?

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Doesn't look like a evil person?

194
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
How do I explain this?

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
I found this on my father.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This spiritual energy was always on Yue Qianxue.

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
And you, Ye Weiming, my father's money,

198
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,400
you're outside the door.

199
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

200
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
This?

201
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Madam, I was with Miss Yue

202
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
at the lantern show.

203
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,800
A man in black took the spiritual energy.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
We followed him here.

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Ye Weiming, my father trusted you.

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
A man in black?

207
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,600
You're the only man in black.

208
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
This is the man in black you wanted.

209
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
There's really a man in black?

210
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
It's important to save him.

211
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
According to the current situation,

212
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
it's not good to waste time.

213
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm afraid it's useless.

214
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,800
Let my father...

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Move.

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
It's over, Yue Qianxue.

217
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Let them go.

218
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Be careful.

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.
