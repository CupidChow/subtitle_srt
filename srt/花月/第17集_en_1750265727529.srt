1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid that I'll be too lonely

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I'll be too lonely

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Later, I've been doubtful

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Madam,

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
it seems that she is getting more and more inappropriate.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She seems to...

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
seems to forget about the past

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and the past of the city.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the temperament has also changed a lot.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She is not the Mistress at all.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She just wants to make her wife

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and Madam Rong Cheng

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to enter the play of Changping Jing.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Actually,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I have been doubting.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have been thinking about

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the relationship between

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the little one and Ping'er's mother.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am not sure

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
about the relationship between the two.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I...

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I dare not think about

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the last moment.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The day when the City Leader took me to the City Leader's Mansion,

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I thought I would die.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I didn't expect that

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was the same kind of person as the City Leader.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Good.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are indeed a man like Hu Yue.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Say it.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Did you act like a woman

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and do something to my wife?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A kind girl like Hu Yue.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How could she act like

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I hurt Madam Chu?

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Moreover,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I have been looking for

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the whereabouts of Hu Yue for so many years.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to ask the City Leader,

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
where did you hide her?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why?

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't see anyone.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't die.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You are

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
very similar to me.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's your name?

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am Wei Chen.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am Tian Ji Pavilion.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have been in the

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hu Pavilion for thousands of years.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am a god.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am a man of the East.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Moreover,

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have a godly will

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
in Tian Ji Pavilion.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't do

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
anything to kill me.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am Wei Chen.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wei Chen

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and Hu Yue's feelings

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
are the same as mine.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
a kind woman.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
City Leader,

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you have been

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
looking for the whereabouts of the people

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and told me about the Pavilion.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When I saw the Pavilion,

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I could feel the power of the Pavilion.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Unfortunately,

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I couldn't

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
steal the secret of the Pavilion.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I left it in the secret room

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
with City Leader

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to investigate the truth

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
of the lady

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and the Pavilion.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I believe

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
as long as I investigate the truth behind it,

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I will find you again.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Later,

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know what happened.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
My body is getting longer

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and longer.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can't get up.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
but

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Chang Pingjing

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
can't be without you all the time.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
take Wei Chen

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and Yi Rong

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
as my eyes

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and mouth

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to keep Chang Pingjing's peace

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
continue to investigate.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
For many years,

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I have been looking for

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the whereabouts of the Pavilion

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and the secret room.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But I can't find the truth.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have to go to the Pavilion

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to investigate

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the relationship between the Pavilion and the Pavilion.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't expect

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to go there

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and find the Pavilion.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was worried

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that my actions would be exposed.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So from that time on,

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I went to the Pavilion

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to find the way

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to make the lady

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yi Rong

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to avoid others' concern for me.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thank you.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So that's the case.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You are a man of luck.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It should be the scent of the sea.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The scent of the sea?

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The scent of the sea is from the new cow, He Zhou.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The scent of the cow will make people angry.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have long been curious about it.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I am so curious.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I am so curious.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No wonder I have become a spirit

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for the past few years.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I am even

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
a man of luck.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Lady Zhu

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
will personally give me

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
a scent of the sea

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
every day.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It seems that

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
it is the scent of the sea.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am so curious.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am so curious.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I am so curious.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I am so curious.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I am so curious.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I am so curious.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I am so curious.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I am so curious.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I am so curious.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I am so curious.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I am so curious.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am so curious.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I am so curious.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I am so curious.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I am so curious.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I am so curious.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I am so curious.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I am so curious.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I am so curious.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I am so curious.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I am so curious.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I am so curious.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I am so curious.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I am so curious.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I am so curious.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am so curious.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am so curious.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I am so curious.

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am so curious.

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Isructures are easy for me as well?

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,160
You will feel 기�bah子

177
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,120
easier with�

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the secret heart.

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay.

180
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
Brother,

181
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,840
I passa

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
A க

183
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,940
My girl, back then I saved your story

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,600
Mrs. преступ started to belong to me

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,640
You should get over it now.

186
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,440
Who is it?

187
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,640
Your Highness, I'm here for a wedding Needle in the Xiyu Inn.

188
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
Since I'm here,

189
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,600
let's Stevie

190
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,440
pleas on you.

191
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

192
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Why did you rush into here?

193
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,480
What a moron.

194
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
body you.

195
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,280
Dance a lullaby to

196
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,160
trap Madam Jia

197
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,740
for the case

198
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,660
of countless cases.

199
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,640
amed it

200
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,440
must-have

201
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
been performed.

202
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,200
The main cause is

203
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,100
Ghost educator

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,000
Peng Yuen

205
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,460
tohe

206
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,680
onymous

207
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,820
and disaster

208
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,160
unit righthough

209
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
18 years ago, you've lost your way.

210
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I can't stay in Changping anymore.

211
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,160
You changed my face back then.

212
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Now...

213
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
you must help me.

214
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Help you?

215
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
The one that His Majesty gave you is the death order.

216
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
If you can't finish the task,

217
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,160
you won't be able to return to the Western World.

218
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,160
What do you think of the outcome?

219
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Will His Majesty still be able to forgive you?

220
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I...

221
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Why don't you help me?

222
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I've lost a fortune in Changping.

223
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
I'll share it with you.

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,160
We've completely disappeared in this world.

225
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,160
You and I are the best choices.

226
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
How much?

227
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Half of the cost.

228
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I want to share it with you.

229
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Go ahead.

230
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
I want to live.

231
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,160
I want to ask you something.

232
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Yes.

233
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I...

234
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm a fool.

235
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
You're a fool?

236
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
You're a fool!

237
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
You're the devil who came to me in the chaos of 18 years ago.

238
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Get out of here!

239
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
I...

240
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
What did you say?

241
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Listen to me.

242
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Your life is nothing different from the life of a wild dog.

243
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I gave you 18 years of life.

244
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I gave you the luxury and wealth you shouldn't have.

245
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
You can stop me now.

246
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Right?

247
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
You're not a fool!

248
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
No!

249
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
An San.

264
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Don't blame me.

265
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm not afraid of death.

266
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
I'm a fool.

267
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
This is a plan.

268
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
I failed.

269
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
If I fail,

270
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I might as well

271
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,160
let you be the son of the Empress.

272
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,160
I think that

273
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,660
I shouldn't have

274
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,160
the love of your room.

275
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm so sorry.

276
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
It's not my fault.

278
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,640
The story is the dream, who will discover the equal of happiness

279
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,820
The people bleary have gone xianyuantrails

280
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,960
Des late, bright like a bee, even wind and drinking water, low like a MG

281
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,660
Love still not over enough for you in thisreme

282
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

283
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

284
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

285
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

286
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

287
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

288
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

289
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

290
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

291
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

292
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

293
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

294
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

295
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

296
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,660
I wish you can watch through me from the dangling night.

297
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,660
But I can't get past you.

298
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I wish to know the right course of position when looking at you.

299
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Thank you in advance.

301
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,660
I'd appreciate it too.

302
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,700
Otherwise,

303
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,660
I wouldn't be where I am today.
