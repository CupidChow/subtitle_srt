1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I am afraid that I will be lonely

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even if we are far apart for thousands of miles

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We will be together in spring and summer

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am afraid that I will be lonely and not sure if I can fly to the past

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't want to ask who I am missing in this life

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know who I am meeting with

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:06,140
Use wholeheartedly to sing for theuri

8
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,200
As for this ration,

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,680
how about having it in the highest price for you?

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
3,000 yuan in the highest price.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,120
Right.

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,520
τικer the day,

13
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,000
it may

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
beżet

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,480
and

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,800
the cycle of

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,240
various types of food

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,760
,

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,440
let's say a look.

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,900
This

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This...

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is not fair.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Recently, the world's everything's

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
cycle of causes and effects

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
has come up with a

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
great conclusion.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Great conclusion?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
At present,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
as long as

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
any living life

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
can't escape this conclusion.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Tell me about it.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
After my research,

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
everything in the world

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
will...

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
will...

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
die!

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ping'er,

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you don't have to work hard.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Your health is the most important.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Go back to your room and rest.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mother, go back to your room and rest.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mother,

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
be careful on the road.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Mother...

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're safe now?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come down.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lu Bu Ping,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
tell me,

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
where did you get this curse?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
From...

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
From...

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, last time,

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I went to pay my father's respects.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
When I arrived at his bedroom,

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
he wasn't there.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He wasn't there.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The floor tiles in the bedroom were broken.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Lu Bu Ping

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
played a big trick on me.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I saw

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
a pile of talismans under the bed.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I thought

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
my father's talisman

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
must be a good thing.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I took it.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It seems that my guess is right.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That lady

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
was pretending.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It wasn't my mother.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Who was that?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
My father?

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My father?

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
My father?

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My mother

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
is my father?

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is my father

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
my grandfather?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Lu Bu Ping,

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I suspect that you were

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
brainwashed when you were a kid.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've been brainwashed many times.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean,

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the City Leader was pretending

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to be the City Leader's wife.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,700
He came to the

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How did you know

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that was my father?

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Earlier that year,

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Madam Zhu went to Wanfu Temple to pray.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She was attacked by the members of the family.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
She was badly injured.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
She hasn't been able to use it yet.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But just now,

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
when Madam Zhu

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
picked up a small book from your hand,

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
she used her left hand.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In my memory,

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the City Leader was a left-handed person.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I always feel weird

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
when my mother was picking up things.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
By the way,

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Lu Bu Ping,

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
take a look at the talisman

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you stole from the City Leader's mansion.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This word?

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can see it now?

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's so ugly.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look at the following three words.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The talisman?

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I thought

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the City Leader already knew

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
about the talisman.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I don't know why.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He wanted to use the talisman to suppress it.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So he came to the price shop.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He should have come

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to look for the talisman that was sealed.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
My brain is itchy.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then,

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
why did my father

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
have to act like

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
my mother?

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He came to look for the talisman.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He could have just found a reason

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to drive me away.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why did he have to leave on his own?

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But since he left,

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
there must be a reason.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The time is 10 days.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's 10 days?

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After the City Leader

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
dressed as the Lady,

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
he seemed to be talking to the City Leader.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But his eyes

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
were always looking in this direction.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The talisman is using the moonlight

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to calculate the time.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Maybe he found that

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
he was delayed by the City Leader.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He couldn't open a certain mechanism.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's why he turned around.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Time?

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Time?

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If I remember correctly,

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
when the Lady came in,

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the light was just

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
on this night pearl.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What does that mean?

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Isn't that just a hole?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The price range

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
is the important place

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to store the long-range gold.

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If it's just a normal hole,

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
he must have fixed it right away.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If the City Leader

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
doesn't ask about this hole,

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
he must have a plan.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't believe it.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Le Bu Ping,

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
don't waste your energy.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This device

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
should be a machine device

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that came from the west.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Trial Lock.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Trial Lock?

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just asked.

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There is a level device

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
inside this toy.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It corresponds to the direction of the moon in the sky.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It can only move

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
within the corresponding time.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Open the Trial Lock.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Other times,

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
even if the device is broken,

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it can't open the Trial Lock.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My father

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is quite good at making foreign things.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What should we do next?

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We can only come back tomorrow.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The Trial Lock

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You bitch!

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't die easily!

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't let my father

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
throw you into the Trial Lock!

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My Lady,

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
do you really think

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't know who you are?

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Fine.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Since you have such a

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
secret identity,

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll give you another horse.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is that okay?

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The Trial Lock

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
As you wish.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This way, you'll look more like him.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Wake up!

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wake up!

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wake up!

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's my fault!

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't hit me!

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And you!

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You two!

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How dare you sleep

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
under my bed!

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How dare you sleep under my bed!

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You have to sleep under my bed!

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's my fault!

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll teach you a lesson!

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Stop running!

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're so stupid!

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're so stupid!

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're so stupid!

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're so stupid!

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Stop!

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I can't stop you!

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And you!

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You're so stupid!

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Stand still!

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No!

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I...

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When did I read in the Eastern Courtyard?

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Qingming.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Qingming!

228
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,000
Qingming!

229
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Qingming.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Qingming.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Qingming.

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Qingming.

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Qingming.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Qingming.

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yue-er...

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Look.

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's snowing.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Look, it's snowing.

239
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,400
Yu'er.

240
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
Ma Jianli, you bastard!

241
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,360
You scared me to death.

242
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,960
Yu'er, what's wrong?

243
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
Why did you get scared?

244
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I couldn't sleep, so I came out for a walk.

245
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
I didn't expect it to snow.

246
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,640
It's just like the first snow I saw.

247
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Look.

248
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
How beautiful it is.

249
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,160
In워서 valuable time.

250
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
P paranormal thoughts drift past this then

251
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,160
I'll pass through the night

252
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,800
The old, or the old i dream who rule

253
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,120
Here in the middle of the hatred

254
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
At night alone for thousands of years

255
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,120
Feelings

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Drifting in slow drifts

257
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,240
The guitar is ringing

258
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,960
Where do

259
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
Love and hate

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I
