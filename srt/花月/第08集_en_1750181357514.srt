1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I just can't figure it out.

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Since Yue Yong likes drinking with women,

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
then you can go directly.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why do you want me to change my clothes?

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To increase the success rate.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If Yue Yong doesn't like me,

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we'll both be back home.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And to be honest,

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you look like this now,

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I feel like your success rate is higher than mine.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright, alright.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wait.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I feel like something is missing.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Missing what?

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, right.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh my god, I'm a little touched.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, right.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have to be careful.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't lose it.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This might be the last thing my mother left me.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, don't worry.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on, come on.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You bastard.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You think I'm easy to get angry?

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've got a lot of crap to say.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Zhao Laosan,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't care what you're doing outside.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you dare to make trouble in my place today,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
don't blame me for being rude.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Chief,

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
look at what you said.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm just drunk.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm drunk.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't blame me.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It seems that this is Yue Yong.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What should we do?

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Should we go over there and toast?

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Or...

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I've never seen him.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on, drink.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What a beautiful little sister.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Drink.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
One cup, one question.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Three cups, three questions.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Miss,

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
how do you know I'm here to ask questions?

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of course I know.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Two little girls risked their lives to come to my place.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In addition to seeking my help,

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
what else can I ask for?

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Are Qin Ming's girls really prettier than me?

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's too much.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why are you following me so closely?

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just came out to relax.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're following me so closely.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not relaxed.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Get out and wait.

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then I'm going to start asking questions.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It was the first question just now.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now it's the second question.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is a question.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You have to cherish this last chance.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please tell the chief of the music room

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
where the long ice crystal princess Lu Qianqian is.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Do you have any clues?

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Your question is not easy.

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's the problem?

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Didn't you say that pretty girls are like clouds?

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Little sister,

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
your question is really out of my expectation.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you want to help me do this,

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will naturally tell you the answer.

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Liar.

83
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, sister.

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please.

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Pretty girls.

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This one.

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This one.

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Little girl,

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
let me drink with you.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm quite shy.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It seems that Brother Buyan is waiting for you

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
with all his luck today.

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on.

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let me see.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hua...

96
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hua Jiaming.

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hua Jiaming.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You...

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yue Qianxue.

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You two made a scene in the City Hall.

102
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now you even send my master here.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are really ungrateful.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wait for me.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wait for me.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait for me to go back and tell my father

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that I will kill you both.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I will wait for you.

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will wait for you.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Come on.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Hey, you two.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why don't you catch me?

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Lu Bu Ping.

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't you want to know

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
what is the truth behind this?

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not the little Lou of the quarter.

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I know what I did that night.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Lu Bu Ping.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
A good young master

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
walked the flower street

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and was caught in the act.

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So,

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
will the successor of the City Hall

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
be further away?

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You...

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You are a liar.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
These years,

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
there have been many rumors

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
about the destruction of the enemy.

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Lu Bu Ping.

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Look at you.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You are so carefree.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm afraid the City Hall

135
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
can't take you.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You...

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You...

138
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You...

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You don't need to scare me.

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You two are both wanted.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You even...

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You even want to fool me.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Lu Bu Ping.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that you have always been smart.

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Although you usually

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
look like a fool,

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it's just that the family is too strict.

149
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You didn't meet the opportunity of a big event.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You are right.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You are indeed a real king.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can see

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the great talent of the City Hall.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Why do you want the City Hall to be...

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We are investigating

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
the truth behind Lu Li's rebellion.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If you help us solve this case,

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
then may I ask

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
who in the Great Changping City

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
would dare to doubt your ability?

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh,

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm a master of the State.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But the work of the City Hall

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
is quite troublesome.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
After the case is solved,

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will teach you how to play the zither.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What did you say?

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The zither

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
will fly.

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You should have said it earlier.

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The Great Changping City

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Episode 16

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Be careful, Madam.

174
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hong Yue,

175
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can't escape.

176
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I can't escape.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Madam.

178
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hong Yue,

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
take the zither and the怪头

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and take me back.

181
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Madam.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Madam.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hong Yue,

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
this is my happiness.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Take me back to the City.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hurry.

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let me go.

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Madam.

189
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let me go.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Red dust and mist,

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I close my eyes,

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
but tears are not enough.

193
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Missing you is like a wind through the night.

194
