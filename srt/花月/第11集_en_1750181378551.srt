1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wish to travel across the vast plains and rivers

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to travel to the ends of the world without end

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will not stop my journey and fly towards the stars

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I do not wish to ask who I am in my next life

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I do not know who I will meet again

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I wish to travel across the vast plains and rivers

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The End

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, you are too much, Hua!

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I rushed here without saying a word when I received your signature

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The monk asked me to come because you two did this

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Stop it, let's get down to business

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Little girl, Hua's family bullied you again?

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's get down to business

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, let me hear what you called me here for

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Lu Bu Ping took me and Yue'er to the price department in City Leader's mansion

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and found out that the City Leader's identity was suspicious

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
City Leader's mansion?

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Nonsense!

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know what your identity is now

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are with Lu Bu Ping?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I...

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you are still in City Leader's mansion

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
no one can save you

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A Yan, this is an emergency

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Listen to me first

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You will understand the reason

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The snow is heavy outside, let's go inside

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Madam, do you like the gift I gave you?

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This was a simple task

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Find the seal and exchange Lu Qianqian's information

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then you will know the reason why Lu Li didn't come

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Find the seal and exchange Lu Qianqian's information

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then you will know the reason why Lu Li betrayed the country

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and find out the truth behind it

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But now things are more complicated

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why did City Leader pretend to be City Leader's wife?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And why did City Leader ask someone to draw this seal?

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's the secret behind this?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then you called me here for...

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The market opens tonight

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We still need to go to the price department

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We need to get the seal before City Leader

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If we let City Leader get the seal first

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we will fall into a very passive situation

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then you don't go, I will go

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
At least if we are in danger, I can escape in time

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A Yan, we called you here this time

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because we have more important things to do

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Besides the seal, we need to know the reason behind it

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We also need to know the source of the seal

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the purpose of the City Leader's painting

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
are also very important

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then where to investigate?

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Tianji Pavilion

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Tianji Pavilion has many people

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and it is a rare event in the world

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He must know who made this seal

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He must know who made this seal

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I haven't recovered yet

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tianji Pavilion is far away

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I'll leave this to you

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
City Leader, the seal turned red

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
City Leader, the seal turned red

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hong Yi, he is here

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He?

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go and meet him

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you, sir

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sir

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hua Qingming and Yue Qianxue

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
met in the south of Changping City

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To prove their innocence

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I asked me to ask you about this seal

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thunder and thunder

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Earth and sky are in chaos

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The four blessings are in chaos

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The four people are in chaos

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This seal

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
should be from Wei Chen

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wei Chen

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wei Chen

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
was once a student of Tianji Pavilion

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
His ancestors were famous dancers

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He has been doing various tricks since childhood

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is he still in Tianji Pavilion now?

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He left Tianji Pavilion many years ago

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When he left Tianji Pavilion

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He said

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He still cares about Hong Chen

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He followed the wind and went away

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Went away?

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I didn't expect a Taoist

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
would be so far away from love

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Taoists are far away

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They are far away

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Love is so far away

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's hard to escape from it

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Everything in the world

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yue Qianxue

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Look at this seal

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The life of a fly

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
is the most important thing in life

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Even it

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
can't escape from love

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The seal also has feelings

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yue Qianxue

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The seal is always in chaos

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The world is too chaotic

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's peaceful

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When the world is in war

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The golden light will strike

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is the emotion

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that it shows to the world

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Golden light

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But I see it

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's red

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Am I wrong?

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yue Qianxue

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
When the time comes

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You will know it

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I tell you

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I Lu Bu Ping

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have this kind of pattern

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If it were someone else

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You would have been beaten

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You Lu Shao Chengzhu

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
is really the lucky one

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Your

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't understand

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But it sounds great

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You eat

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will come

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
later

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Come

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you, brother Qingming

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's time to eat

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's time to eat

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Feng Po

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In Changping

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Except Hua Qingming

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and Ye Weibing

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Who is the best dancer?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Of course

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's you and me

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I won't say it

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
As long as you and me

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
work together

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Who else in the world

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
dares to be a member of the family

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As long as we two work together

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We can make new friends

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
in the city

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He is a Changying

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He won't come

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's not bad

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Look

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
These two

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I know how to make friends

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's cold

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Brother Guolong

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is there someone behind you?

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't know

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Go

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's cold

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Go

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Go

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Go

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Behind you

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There is a young master

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to guard

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hua Hua

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hua Hua

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm wrong

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is it

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is everything

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
not a dream?

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ye Qianxun

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You die quickly

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
After you die

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Changping will be the world of the new country

188
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Miss

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ye Qianxun

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You die by yourself

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I won't be with you

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Go

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Go

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Go
