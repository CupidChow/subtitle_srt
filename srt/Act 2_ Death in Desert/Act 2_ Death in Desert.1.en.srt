199
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,911
To go in and see

200
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:24,815
- You do not embarrass others - the really important thing

201
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:28,252
Let me go right on about

202
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,122
I want to sleep

203
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,725
What do you want

204
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:42,433
I heard my fiance came here and no sound

205
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,969
Feel embarrassed

206
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,171
Sorry

207
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,611
Really

208
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,684
Can it

209
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,788
- Come in, do not touch things - of course

210
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,392
- Let me just fine - you take it easy

211
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,928
- Let me go - wait

212
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:49,634
- You first calm down - do not stop me

213
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:58,142
He says something here not to hurry me out

214
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,213
- You first calm down - do not stop me

215
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,250
Do not be so rude people do not recognize

216
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,921
- Let me go - you calm down

217
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,891
- Let me look - wait

218
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,169
Or out of it

219
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,937
gone

220
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,907
Really

221
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:35,246
I must find him

222
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,718
- You do not go crazy - he certainly nothing wrong here

223
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,953
We find out, come

224
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,256
Hurry up

225
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,927
Then you are open with the dead in that room right

226
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,295
Correct

227
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,631
What is your relationship

228
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,970
Once lovers

229
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,439
Now split up

230
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,780
Be broke right

231
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:08,719
That you often see it

232
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,556
Correct

233
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,026
Or to maintain a relationship

234
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,434
Please tell us truthfully

235
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:33,043
What strange dead before it

236
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:40,150
No normal

237
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:03,107
Specific causes of death have to wait autopsy report

238
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:09,780
If there are any clues must tell us

239
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:23,594
He was not killed by you

240
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,908
This matter how you look

241
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:45,315
Now tell

242
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:52,690
I feel very strange

243
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:54,792
Ah

244
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:03,000
She is not like killing people like

245
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,336
I am terrified of it

246
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,641
What you say

247
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:26,390
Or to wait for the investigation to a conclusion clearly

248
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,089
Please wait

249
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:09,299
I want to ask you a little something

250
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,277
Do you remember me

251
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,428
Then come

252
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:54,738
What can I do to hurry to say

253
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:05,015
You say help me

254
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,987
In the end is what

255
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,730
If you do not want even a bar

256
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,068
This also boring

257
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:39,042
I do not want to rebound guy

258
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,248
You do

259
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:54,257
Nor is it about twice can be resolved

260
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:02,366
I waited for you for so long

261
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,703
I have not seen you back

262
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,275
I say

263
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:21,785
You are not forgotten me

264
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,990
- Not so - you nonsense

265
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,159
You hurt me to let go

266
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,396
You put me in the end what

267
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:43,974
Forget it

268
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,780
I still go

269
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,650
Goodbye

270
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,271
do not go

271
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,066
And so on

272
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,034
Is there anything else

273
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:05,575
I just want to apologize

274
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:10,213
Forget all gone

275
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:16,253
You must let me help you

276
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,390
Please, give me a chance

277
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,715
Hey

278
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,984
See a face, right

279
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,694
When he left,

280
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,767
There did not say anything

281
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,040
Tell me about it

282
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,680
With you

283
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,684
What happened

284
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,958
Nothing

285
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,096
Then suddenly collapsed

286
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,566
One o'clock are not threatened

287
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,838
I do not know how to do

288
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,180
Is this

289
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,035
You can not escape

290
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,604
Acknowledge your fate

291
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,074
Hard point

292
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,675
To the point of reaction do not play dead person ah

293
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:42,759
You are not dead to the point of reaction ah

294
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:11,154
How you answer me ah

295
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:23,599
I so bad

296
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,769
Answer me ah

297
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,122
You want me to

298
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,160
How to do it

299
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,330
Lying here

300
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,244
I say

301
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,250
Such things are a

302
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,424
What else to say

303
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,161
People are not in a

304
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,766
Only memories

305
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,874
How even then kind

306
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:51,414
He also never come back

307
01:05:54,784 --> 01:06:01,557
You can make it a dead man alive

308
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:12,268
Now how will the mood to do anything else

309
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:21,410
I think of all his

310
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:35,591
Is That night I do not go

311
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:46,268
Originally I thought maybe can together

312
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:58,481
We never see the results now

313
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,519
This feeling

314
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,224
You can feel it

315
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,129
This loss

316
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,536
Before obviously also good

317
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:29,045
Suddenly lying on the ground does not move

318
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,418
One o'clock are not threatened

319
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:40,489
A living

320
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,196
So no

321
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:55,404
You have had this experience yet

322
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,407
Really

323
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,447
Ungrateful

324
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,286
Originally

325
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,192
Two people together more than good

326
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,666
Yes ah

327
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,237
Two people

328
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,275
Out affair do

329
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:48,757
Originally dared not a good thing

330
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:52,328
This time something went wrong

331
01:08:54,530 --> 01:09:00,769
In addition there is any way to blame themselves

332
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:09,445
Anyway, to this point

333
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:18,454
Or see yourself

334
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,092
Do not blame others

335
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,231
Own good too

336
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:39,308
Live on it

337
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,021
A person you used to it

338
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,427
Not accustomed

339
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,733
It seems to be on the right

340
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:14,910
Really face is another matter

341
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,581
This is God's right

342
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,653
God will punish me

343
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,193
Because I

344
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,534
Done should not do

345
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,510
I made a mistake

346
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,223
This is probably deserve it

347
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:09,465
If a person would not have

348
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,478
Right

349
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:32,154
Still want to have a partner now
