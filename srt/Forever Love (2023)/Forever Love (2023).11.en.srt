(Love and Betrayal Are Long-Planned)

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,200
You have to believe me.

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,399
It really wasn't me.

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,719
I've warned you before.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,320
I have a bad temper.

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,079
Seems like I didn't make myself
clear enough.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,200
I was wrong.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,280
I was wrong.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,079
I will never do it again.

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,520
I beg you.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
Please let me go.

14
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,280
Get lost!

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
Just let her off like this?

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
She did such a disgusting thing.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
You want to be like her?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,359
I did it all for you.

19
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,079
Qin Moyao,

20
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,040
you're protecting her now.

21
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,439
But if one day she finds out

22
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,640
it was her father
who ruined your family,

23
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,000
can she still

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,560
accept your kindness?

25
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,799
Then I'll never let her know.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
Qin Moyao,

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
you'll regret it.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Has Qin Moyao gone mad?

29
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,680
That's his enemy's daughter.

30
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
He could go to such lengths for her.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,959
Stop crying.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,280
You.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,879
Why would you do such a stupid thing?

34
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,439
Why?

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,080
You tell me!

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
That day you saw her with Mo.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,319
You were so jealous.

38
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,120
You can't see it yourself.

39
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,199
Let alone she's been bullying me.

40
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,360
Should I just do nothing?

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,159
But you shouldn't use
such a stupid method.

42
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,199
Do you have any other methods?

43
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,759
Tong,

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,960
why are you here all of a sudden?

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I can do it myself.

46
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,520
I've never asked you before.

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,879
Are you

48
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,639
comfortable living in my room?

49
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,360
It's quite good.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Why ask?

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,439
During this time,

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
I turned blind,

53
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,680
and my father passed away.

54
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,080
The group is in chaos.

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,120
You and Chi Shan are helping me
handle it.

56
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,919
I've never asked about it.

57
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,800
Recently I've been feeling better.

58
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,919
So I want to ask,

59
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,120
have you encountered
any problems recently?

60
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,680
Tong,

61
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't understand what you're saying.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,680
Why did you ask those men to harm me?

63
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,759
I didn't.

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
You still want to lie to me?

65
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,120
They have all told the truth.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,639
The woman who instructed them

67
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,439
was wearing
a blue heart-shaped diamond pendant.

68
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,400
Don't tell me you threw it away.

69
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,919
Tong,

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,439
you've been deceived.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,519
Up to this point today,

72
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,319
I don't want to hide it anymore.

73
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,959
Come out with me.

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
I'll tell you everything.

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,120
What do you want to tell me?

76
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,240
Speak.

77
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,560
Tong,

78
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,639
who told you
that Yuwei did something to you?

79
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,959
Was it Mo?

80
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,519
Does it matter who said it?

81
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,959
I only know what I've experienced.

82
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,480
Right,

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,920
I questioned Yuwei.

84
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,680
Why are you so eager
to come out and explain?

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
I just don't want you to be deceived
by Zhou Mo anymore.

86
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,120
I've been investigating him
these past few days.

87
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,079
I finally have evidence today.

88
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,199
Then tell me.

89
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,680
Lin Guofu is dead.

90
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,680
Lin Xintong is blind.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Aren't we all just trying
to take this opportunity

92
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,759
to make some money?

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
Why don't we cooperate?

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm not greedy.

95
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,480
How about giving me

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,240
ten percent of the money you get?

97
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,079
He not only wants a share of your money,

98
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,759
but his ambition is also big.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,399
He suggested to me

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
to marry you as soon as possible

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,040
and secretly divide your property.

102
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,839
Impossible.

103
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,680
He's not that kind of person.

104
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,079
Tong,

105
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,639
you're too naive.

106
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,639
What can't people do

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
for their own desires?

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,839
Then how do you explain
what happened that day?

109
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,079
Those rogues clearly said...

110
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,160
Who brought you

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
to those punks that day?

112
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,720
It was...

113
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,120
It was his buddy,

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,360
right?

115
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,759
Mo had people hurt you

116
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,959
and then appeared like a savior.

117
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,959
He had also instructed them
to frame Yuwei.

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,279
All of this was his careful design.

119
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,639
He wants to gain your trust

120
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,439
and by the way,
to drive a wedge between us.

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,879
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
It's not that we didn't want
to tell you.

123
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,600
It's just that you trust him
so much right now.

124
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,680
We worried that if you knew earlier,
you'd alert him.

125
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,839
We don't know what he might do

126
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,360
to hurt you in a hurry.

127
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm also trying to protect you.

128
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,360
Chi Shan,

129
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,199
thank you for telling me all this.

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,720
But I still need time to think it over.

131
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,160
(Mo had people hurt you)

132
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,199
(and then appeared like a savior.)

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,040
(He had also instructed them
to frame Yuwei.)

134
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,079
(All of this was his careful design.)

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,920
(He wants to gain your trust.)

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,079
(Just a woman.)

137
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
(She was wearing a necklace.)

138
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,279
(A diamond one)

139
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,199
(with a blue heart-shaped pendant.)

140
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,120
(At least up to now,)

141
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,399
(I have not done anything to hurt you.)

142
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,959
(Lin Guofu is dead.)

143
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,000
(Lin Xintong is blind.)

144
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,839
(Aren't we all just trying
to take this opportunity)

145
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,000
(to make some money?)

146
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,160
(On the day of the funeral,
many debt collectors came.)

147
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,800
(My father owed a lot of money.)

148
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,000
(They asked me to pay it back.)

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
(My mother had a stroke out of anger.)

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,839
(Mo couldn't possibly harm me.)

151
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,560
