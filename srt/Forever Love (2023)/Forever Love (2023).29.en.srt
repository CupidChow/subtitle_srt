you don't seem surprised.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,879
Of course.

32
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,599
I intentionally told you

33
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,240
I was going to deal with Lin Xintong.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,199
Naturally, you will figure out

35
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,439
that I've already moved against her.

36
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,759
You care about her so much,

37
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,560
so you will keep an eye on her.

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,319
You can't let me get close to her.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
So it seems

40
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,759
I fell into your trap.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,759
Not really.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Qin Moyao.

43
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
You're meant to lose today.

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,199
If you come,

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,560
I won't let you leave alive.

46
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,280
If you don't come,

47
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,960
I will rightfully marry her.

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
So whether you come or not,

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,360
you'll lose.

50
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,319
But you found yourself

51
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,919
a slightly better ending.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,759
But,

53
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,680
once you die,

54
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,240
I will still have her.

55
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,000
Qin Moyao,

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,840
you must be very painful down below.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
Chi Shan,

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,120
do you hate me that much?

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,879
Yes.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,360
You took everything from me.

61
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,280
Back then,

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,639
my dad worked hard for Lin Guofu

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
and helped him swallow the Qin Group,

64
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,000
making Hongfu

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,439
one of the top listed groups
in the city.

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
But in the end,

67
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,919
after Lin Guofu learned of his methods,

68
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,280
he condemned my dad

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,879
and even forced him
to surrender himself.

70
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,520
My dad died of despair.

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
How did Lin Guofu find out about this?

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,960
It was you, Qin Moyao.

73
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,240
You insisted on going to court

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,639
and even exposed it to the media.

75
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,560
It was you.

76
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,120
You forced him to his death.

77
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,800
Back then, everyone thought

78
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,360
Liu Yuanshan was scapegoated
for Lin Guofu.

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,240
Even I thought

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,680
the real mastermind was Lin Guofu.

81
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,600
But in fact,

82
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,839
Lin Guofu knew nothing about the truth.

83
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,480
Yes.

84
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,279
You know what?

85
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,319
It was my idea to set up a trap

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,639
for your father's company.

87
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,639
I know Lin Guofu too well.

88
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,040
If he had known

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,160
it was a trap,

90
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,079
he would have objected.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,600
Chi Shan,

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
you really are unforgivable.

93
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,800
You were too stupid.

94
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,480
I've been thinking

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
these days.

96
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,199
Since my dad
and I did these things for Lin Guofu,

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
what he has should belong to me.

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,839
It took me so much effort.

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,759
When I was about to marry Lin Xintong,

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
you showed up.

101
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,279
In just three months,

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,279
you took away my fiancee,

103
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,399
took my money,

104
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,920
and ruined my company.

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,600
Qin Moyao,

106
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,600
have I had every reason to hate you?

107
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,800
Hearing that,

108
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,600
I feel proud of myself.

109
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,319
How about this?

110
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
We make a bet.

111
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,399
Why should I do it?

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
My life isn't worth much,

113
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,279
but my bets are different.

114
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,120
If I win,

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,639
you will turn yourself in

116
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,720
and stop bothering Lin Xintong.

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,839
If I lose,

118
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,800
I will give you all my shares

119
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,079
in Hongfu

120
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,800
and property.

121
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Deal or no deal?

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,959
Deal.

123
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,720
Your old wound hasn't healed, has it?

124
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
(Xia Yuwei texted me last night,)

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
(asking me to see her this morning.)

126
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,199
(I can't make it.)

127
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,079
(You find her for me.)

128
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,240
(No matter what,)

129
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,040
(you have to see her today.)

130
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,160
I give it to you.

131
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,680
You check it out.
