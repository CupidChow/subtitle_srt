00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,673
(What Are We Now)

4
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,940
Miss Lin's acting

5
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,619
is actually pretty good.

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,739
They've been putting on a show
in front of me for so long.

7
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,699
How could I lose to them?

8
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,460
Since you've openly had a falling-out,

9
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,259
why not kick her out

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,900
but keep her stay in your room?

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,500
Haven't you noticed?

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,020
At critical moments,

13
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,059
Chi Shan didn't stand up for her at all.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,739
You think Chi Shan
is still on your side?

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,259
Don't tell me...

16
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:09,780
In your eyes,

17
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:13,500
I look like a naive
and easily deceived girl?

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,579
I'm worried that you'll forget the pain
once the wound is healed.

19
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,420
You've underestimated me.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,780
I mean, Xia Yuwei should at least notice

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,579
Chi Shan may not be reliable
at critical moments.

22
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,940
I intend to steadily break the bond

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,900
between her and Chi Shan.

24
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,420
Do you think your actions

25
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,579
won't arouse Chi Shan's suspicion?

26
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,460
I want him to be suspicious.

27
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,619
I want him to fail to guess

28
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,259
what I'm really thinking.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,579
Whether I trust him or not.

30
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,860
And seeing them so guilty

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,020
is so interesting.

32
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,219
Enemies show the clues
when they're flustered,

33
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,179
don't they?

34
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,420
You have no idea

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,619
who you are dealing with.

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,940
He's someone
who could even commit murder.

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,179
I don't need to know.

38
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,980
He'd better be
desperate enough to kill me.

39
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,300
So, I'll have the evidence.

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,539
Lin Xintong!

41
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:14,619
Can you stop being stubborn?

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,020
Since we've decided

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,699
to work together...

44
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,139
I didn't say I would cooperate with you.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,980
Qin Moyao,

46
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,099
in our contract,

47
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,420
you're just my assistant.

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,179
Don't tell me what I should do.

49
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,780
Remember your place.

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,739
Do you have to talk to me

51
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,820
in this way?

52
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:37,860
Yes.

53
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,460
So I hope you can adapt quickly.

54
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,300
Let's make a bet.

55
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,699
Within ten seconds,

56
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,179
Xia Yuwei would come to beg me,

57
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,579
begging me not to kick her out.

58
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,219
Ten.

59
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,900
Nine.

60
00:02:58,739 --> 00:02:59,500
Eight.

61
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,739
Seven.

62
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,059
Six.

63
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,179
Five.

64
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,179
Four.

65
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,380
Three.

66
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:06,500
Two.

67
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:08,940
Tong.

68
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,020
Tong, please don't kick me out.

69
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,380
In this world,

70
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,420
you're all I have.

71
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,699
If you kick me out,

72
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,539
I have nowhere to go.

73
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:20,460
Tong.

74
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,659
Tong.

75
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,739
Please.

76
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,900
If I let you stay...

77
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,259
I'm willing to do anything.

78
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,099
Why are you here?

79
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,219
Aren't you afraid of being discovered?

80
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,380
Tong has gone to bed.

81
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,699
What?

82
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,099
You want to disassociate from me

83
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,539
after what happened today?

84
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,179
That's not what I meant.

85
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,179
It's just that you were
caught by Tong today.

86
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,579
It's better to be careful.

87
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,059
Today.

88
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,380
You dare to mention today?

89
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,139
In such a situation,

90
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,659
you refused to speak up for me.

91
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,739
How could I speak up for you
in that situation?

92
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,179
And I've told you before,

93
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:02,980
not to show off with it,

94
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,099
but you never listened to me.

95
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,300
What's the point of saying these now?

96
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,179
Fortunately, I've already pleased Tong.

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,460
Is that true?

98
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
How did you make it?

99
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,219
We've been besties
for over twenty years.

100
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,020
I naturally have my ways.

101
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,460
That's good.

102
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,059
But Qin Moyao is always a ticking bomb.

103
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,380
He knows our big secret,

104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,780
and he knows that I fooled him.

105
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,539
He might say something

106
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,380
to Tong since he's back now.

107
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,820
Maybe

108
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,139
he has something to do with
what happened tonight.

109
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,460
What should we do?

110
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,500
I've already contacted
a group of people.

111
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,259
I didn't want to deal with him so soon,

112
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,340
but he insisted on presenting himself.

113
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,460
What kind of people?

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,699
Are you sure you can handle him?

115
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,099
Be careful.

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,059
The doctor said you have healed.

117
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,940
Only your eyes need to recover.

118
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,780
You need to take your medicine on time.

119
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,300
I heard Chi Shan on the phone,

120
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,619
saying he found a group of people.

121
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:24,940
What people?

122
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,259
What does he want to do?

123
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,259
I don't know, Tong.

124
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,139
I promised you

125
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,460
that I would tell you

126
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,780
everything I know.

127
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,659
You won't tell him our things, will you?

128
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:39,219
How could I?

129
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,860
I learned my lesson.

130
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,340
Don't I know better?

131
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,900
Go now.

132
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,420
Call the police.

133
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,699
Go to a crowded place.

134
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,219
You?

135
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:48,780
Go now.

136
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:50,380
Go.

137
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,259
Go, go.

138
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,699
Go!

139
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,340
Take it easy.

140
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:10,380
Tong,

141
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:11,940
are you okay?

142
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,020
I'm fine.

143
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,820
Yuwei messaged me
and told me everything.

144
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Was it a robbery?

145
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Should we call the police?

146
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,579
It's upon you.

147
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,259
I'm tired.

148
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,300
I'm leaving.

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,980
Hello, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

150
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,020
Don't do this again.

151
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,940
You...

152
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,300
You are worried about me?

153
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm afraid Zhou Mo
would come to me again,

154
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,980
saying that you're risking
your life for me.

155
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,579
Let me check your wound.

156
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,300
You bled so much.

157
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,020
It's fine. None of this blood is mine.

158
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,099
Not your blood?

159
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,380
Why did you choose to fight
in the parking lot?

160
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,699
Don't you know I was there?

161
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,460
Weren't you scared to hurt me?

162
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,780
I'm sorry. It was my oversight.

163
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,820
I didn't know you would go with her.

164
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,379
Don't let your anger

165
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,419
disrupt our plan.

166
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,780
I've already switched Tong's medicine.

167
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,540
As long as we can stabilize her,

168
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,860
we can follow the original plan.

169
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,139
Our Plan?

170
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,339
Our plan

171
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,940
has long been disrupted by him.

172
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,020
Go now.

173
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,580
Call the police.

174
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,860
Go to a crowded place.

175
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:47,379
You?

176
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:47,860
Go now.

177
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,660
Go.

178
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,499
Go, go.

179
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,020
I remembered something,

180
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,540
but I don't know if I'm overthinking.

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
What is it?

182
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,219
I think Tong...

183
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
She might be able to see.

184
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:12,179
What did you say?

185
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,020
When did this happen?

186
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,580
But it is just my guess.

187
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,020
I'm not certain yet.

188
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,179
Then find an opportunity to confirm it.

189
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,620
When you go out later,

190
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,059
help me get rid of this.

191
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,700
So, she changed the medicine.

192
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:42,219
How could she possibly
side with us completely?

193
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,980
She just wants to please both sides.

194
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,299
Oh,

195
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,219
those people were
ordered by Chi Shan, right?

196
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,820
Who are they?

197
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm not sure.

198
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,099
Even you can't make sure?

199
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,339
They are well-trained.

200
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:01,700
And they clearly aimed at me.

201
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,660
If they hadn't retreated first,

202
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,660
I couldn't guarantee
I could leave unscathed.

203
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,379
What do you mean?

204
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,339
It is not important.

205
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,860
If this happens again, run at once.

206
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,259
Run in one direction.

207
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,020
I can always hold them back.

208
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,020
Understand?

209
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,940
How can I
leave you behind and run again?

210
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,219
What if something happens to you,

211
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:20,820
I...

212
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,099
Silly girl,

213
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,339
if you run, call the police.

214
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,580
That also counts as saving me.

215
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,820
When did you start
worrying about me so much?

216
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,299
I...

217
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,139
I'm just worried

218
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,339
if something happens to you,

219
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,339
I won't have anyone to order around.

220
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,620
Rest assured.

221
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,820
I won't let anything happen to me.

222
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,459
I'm not reassured.

223
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,339
We need to figure out a way
to deal with Chi Shan soon.

224
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,339
Otherwise, you'll always be in danger.
