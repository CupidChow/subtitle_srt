=Episode 26=

3
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:35,520
(Move Carefully)

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,560
The evidence

5
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,280
has already disappeared from this world.

6
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,039
I deleted it a long time ago.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,399
You are shameless.

8
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,359
But Qin Moyao is different.

9
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,560
I have videos

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,479
and recordings.

11
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,320
And his fingerprints were left
on the will.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
The evidence is enough
to put him in jail, right?

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,599
Go ahead.

14
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,480
He has been deceiving me for so long.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,439
Do you think I still care about him?

16
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,319
You don't care?

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,400
You came to see me immediately

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,719
after hearing the news about him.

19
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,120
Haven't you already told me the answer?

20
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,359
If I make all this information public,

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,040
not only Qin Moyao will go to jail,

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,719
but Hongfu Group will get burdened.

23
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,159
You know the financial situation

24
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,359
of Hongfu Group.

25
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,840
If the stock price continues to plummet,

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,159
your father's business

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,799
will be ruined by you.

28
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,599
What do you want?

29
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,640
Let's act as if nothing happened.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,439
How about getting married?

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,799
Don't forget.

32
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,000
In the eyes of others,

33
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm still your fiance.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,039
Think about it.

35
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,120
I'll wait for your answer.

36
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,240
Wait.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
You tell Qin Moyao

38
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,639
not to act rashly.

39
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,879
My temper is not so good.

40
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,199
Don't.

41
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,520
Xintong.

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,240
Xintong.

43
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,240
Xintong.

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,439
Lin Xintong.

45
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,919
Xintong.

46
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,800
Where have you been?

47
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,199
There's no food at home,

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
so I went to buy some.

49
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,360
What's wrong?

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
I just had a dream.

51
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,840
I dreamed that you left me.

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
I woke up and found you gone.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,120
I thought you had left.

54
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,680
(Lin Xintong.)

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,039
(Without you,)

56
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,479
(maybe these people around you)

57
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,759
(could be a little happier.)

58
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,680
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,439
Picking on me again?

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
Yuwei.

61
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not here to argue with you.

62
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,279
Then what? To humiliate me?

63
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,839
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,000
Now you can apologize to me?

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,440
What?

66
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
I just apologized

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
for what happened at my birthday party.

68
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,560
Though you shamelessly

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,279
wore my engagement ring,

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,160
I shouldn't have humiliated you

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,319
in front of so many friends.

72
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,959
I slapped you just now

73
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,959
for what you've done
to me over the years.

74
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,240
Now we're even.

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,800
You came just to tell me this?

76
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,680
Xia Yuwei.

77
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,120
I've been seeing you

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,079
as my best friend.

79
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,560
That day

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
when I saw you and Chi Shan together,

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
what upset me wasn't the betrayal

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
of my fiance,

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,959
but the loss

84
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,480
of a twenty-year best friend.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,519
But I never expected

86
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,360
that you would see me in this way.

87
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,600
Chi Shan gave me this engagement ring.

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,800
Perhaps it means more to you.

89
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,639
I'll give it to you.

90
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,040
Actually, some words you said to me

91
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,120
that day might be right.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,399
Without me in this world,

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,199
maybe the people around me

94
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,720
could be a little happier.

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,079
This is the last time
I give you something.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,439
I hope you accept it.

97
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,639
I know Chi Shan very well.

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,959
Once he targets at Qin Moyao,

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
he won't let him go easily.

100
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,360
No matter what you do, it's useless.

101
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,879
Chi Shan killed my father,

102
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,360
but I can't even find the evidence.

103
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
Even he can't be sanctioned
in accordance with the law.

104
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,839
What I have to do

105
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
is not just for Qin Moyao.

106
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,160
Did you find anything?

107
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
This guy is really well hidden.

108
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,399
I worked so hard

109
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,319
to find some information about him.

110
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
(News on Liu Yuanshan's suicide and suspected fraud)
This is the news back then.

111
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,040
After the incident with Qin Group,

112
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,800
Hongfu Group faced an investigation.

113
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,000
At that time, everyone thought

114
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,279
Liu Yuanshan was the scapegoat
for Lin Guofu.

115
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,240
What does this have to do with Chi Shan?

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,920
Liu Yuanshan is his foster father.

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
I didn't expect

118
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,199
you would actually come to me.

119
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,920
(Bank Transfer Record)

120
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
What do you mean?

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,279
When Chi Shan
transferred Lin Xintong's money,

122
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,480
you did it for him, right?

123
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
He has always known

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
there was 60 million yuan
in Lin Xintong's account.

125
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,480
He probably didn't know

126
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,759
another 30 million yuan
had already been transferred by you.

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,039
So what?

128
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,799
Well,

129
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,600
if he had known

130
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,399
that you betrayed him secretly,

131
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,559
what would he do?

132
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Maybe you're not afraid,

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,200
because you have something on him.

134
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't have it.

135
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
You do,

136
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,080
and only you have it.

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,559
You were the first to view
the surveillance footage in the study.

138
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
You handled it alone.

139
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,039
You know Chi Shan pretty well.

140
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,159
You must have left a way out
for yourself.

141
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,519
You've been having a copy

142
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,799
