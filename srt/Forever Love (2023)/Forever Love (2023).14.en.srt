(There's Nothing Wrong
in Admitting Liking You)

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,600
Is there one more?

5
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,959
Mr. Wang,

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,439
if my dad was not
the biggest shareholder of Hongfu,

7
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,079
then who is it?

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,480
This is out of my duty.

9
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,560
For the shareholder structure of Hongfu,

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,359
as shareholders,
you should know better than me.

11
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,959
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
You're welcome.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,200
That's all for today.

14
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:40,959
Alright?

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,120
I'll walk you out.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,439
Okay.

17
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,120
Thank you.

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,680
Tong,

19
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,079
did Uncle Lin ever tell you

20
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,439
who he gave the shares to?

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,319
I don't know,

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,200
but there must be a reason
for my father to do this.

23
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,079
Tong.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
Chi Shan,

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,200
Dad is gone now,

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
and the matter of the will
has been settled.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,439
Let's live our lives well from now on.

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,520
Miss Lin.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,560
Well,

30
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,120
don't you

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,439
recognize me, not even my voice?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,919
Your eyes are fine,

33
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,240
but your heart turns blind?

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,680
Zhou Mo,

35
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,960
what are you here for?

36
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,599
To claim a contract violation penalty?

37
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:44,919
How much?

38
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,800
I'll pay you.

39
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,840
Lin Xintong,

40
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,280
do you think all matters

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,919
can be resolved with money?

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,080
If Qin Moyao weren't for money,

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,639
would he be willing to change the will

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,560
for others?

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Lin Xintong,

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,199
Qin Moyao accepted that mission

47
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,919
because his mother
was lying in the hospital bed,

48
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,080
waiting for him to save her.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,319
He later found out that the documents
he swapped were a will,

50
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,759
and felt something was wrong.

51
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,319
During this period,

52
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,919
he has been secretly
investigating Chi Shan.

53
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,599
Why didn't he say it from the beginning?

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
Say what?

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,919
Your fiancé wants to harm you?

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,240
How many days have you known each other?

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,680
If he said it,

58
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,360
would you believe him,
who you've always suspected

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,479
to be the one who killed your father?

60
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,199
Or would you believe your fiancé?

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,719
As for those thugs,

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,879
indeed,

63
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,520
I hired them at first.

64
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,039
I just wanted them to scare you

65
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,080
and force you to fire Qin Moyao.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,800
Who would have thought
that those two rascals

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,199
would take double pay

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
and let Xia Yuwei take advantage?

69
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,280
Because of this,

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,000
that boy had his first argument with me.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,960
Why did you want him fired?

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,199
Why?

73
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,599
How many times has he been hurt for you?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
Can I just stand by and watch him die?

75
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,520
It's not worth it.

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,719
It's just a job.

77
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
Why so desperate?

78
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,680
You're asking me?

79
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,599
And that necklace he gave you.

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,120
It's his father's.

81
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,199
He doesn't even let me touch it.

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,639
But you

83
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,680
just threw it away.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
Well done.

85
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
I didn't know that.

86
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,680
You didn't know?

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,120
That kid likes you.

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
You didn't know.

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,759
Is it because you really can't feel it?

90
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,600
Or is it because you're really blind?

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,720
He likes me?

92
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,519
These past few days,

93
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,319
he's been getting drunk every day
and never sobered up.

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,639
I really can't stand
seeing him misunderstood by you.

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,319
Alright.

96
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,480
I've said all I have to say.

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,439
Also,

98
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,240
here's the information
on Xia Yuwei you wanted.

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,319
After your father's death,

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,639
the record of
her account's liquid assets

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,759
is all in here.

102
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
We're even now.

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,720
It's better to stay out of touch.

104
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,199
So long.

105
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,639
Hello.

106
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,000
I want to see you.

107
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,120
When?

108
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,160
Now.

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,439
Now...

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,199
Why are you here?

111
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,600
Sign it.

112
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,360
What's this?

113
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Your new contract.

114
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,920
From today on,

115
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,600
you are my personal assistant.

116
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,759
You

117
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
trust me now?

118
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,600
Three reasons.

119
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,160
First,

120
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,279
if you really killed my father,

121
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,279
there's no need for you

122
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,759
to pretend to be Zhou Mo
and stay by my side,

123
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,160
which left me to catch you red-handed.

124
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
Second,

125
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,120
if it's really for money,

126
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
then you absolutely have the chance

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,439
to steal the seal

128
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,160
and transfer all my money away.

129
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,759
But you didn't.

130
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,360
In conclusion,

131
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,199
whether I trust you or not
has nothing to do with it.

132
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,639
The facts are as they are.

133
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,120
Then,

134
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,319
what about the third reason?

135
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:53,639
Third,

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,000
you like me.

137
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,560
Zhou Mo said so.

138
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,399
Zhou Mo.

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,959
What?

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Did he lie to me?

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
No.

142
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,680
I like you.

143
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,560
There's nothing wrong in admitting it.

144
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,519
Can you sign it now?

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,079
Let me see my father's earliest will.

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,879
The original one
should have been destroyed by Chi Shan.

147
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,759
I felt something was wrong
when I got it back,

148
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,680
so I took a photo as a backup.

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,839
Your father wanted to
donate all his inheritance

150
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,360
to a trust fund.

151
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,199
You can only

152
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,959
receive a fixed amount each month.

153
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,839
If you were to die,

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,480
all the property

155
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,360
would be donated
in the form of public welfare.

156
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,319
He must have foreseen

157
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,199
that Chi Shan's approach
to you was suspicious,

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,639
so he tried his best to
prevent Chi Shan from hurting you.

159
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,480
How do you think he would hurt me?

160
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,919
At the least,

161
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,039
marry you and then
immediately divorce you,

162
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
taking half your property.

163
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,919
At worst,

164
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,720
have you die unexpectedly
like your father,

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
and he would get the entire Lin family.

166
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
You didn't tell me last time

167
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,919
if my father's death

168
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,120
is related to him.
