00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,682
(Don't Mess with the Blind Heiress)

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,039
If I were,

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,799
would you be scared?

6
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,744
Yes.

7
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,240
If you had no one to worry about,
would you still be scared?

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,280
As long as I'm alive,

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,880
I will find evidence
that you killed my father.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,159
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,319
Chi Shan.

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,584
Tong.

13
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,079
You came at the right time.

14
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,480
Help me get the surveillance camera
from the bookshelf.

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,879
Surveillance camera?

16
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,640
Miss Lin, are you referring to this?

17
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,120
Your hands are so cold. You're scared?

18
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,879
Miss Lin, you're overthinking it.
I'm always cold

19
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,400
all year round.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,159
It's surprising that Mr. Lin

21
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,879
put a surveillance camera here.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,759
I discovered it by accident.

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,840
I didn't expect it
to come in handy today.

24
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
Chi Shan, Yuwei,

25
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,800
check if there's anyone suspicious

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,520
in this surveillance footage,

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
especially if Zhou Mo is in it.

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,400
Chi Shan, what's wrong?

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,919
Tong, we need a card reader for this.
Is there one at home?

30
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,560
It's in the drawer in my room.

31
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,960
Okay, I'll go get it.

32
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,479
(Mr. Lin.)

33
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,560
(Someone, help!)

34
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,744
Is there anyone?

35
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,560
No, no one else came into the room

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
except Mr. Lin

37
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,159
on the day he died.

38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,416
Is that so?

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,120
Tong, you should believe it now.

40
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,479
Mr. Lin's death really was an accident.

41
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,719
Have you checked other places?

42
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,400
What about the camera at the stairs?

43
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,159
There's no camera there.

44
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
Except for this camera
which I wasn't aware of,

45
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,080
we've checked all the others,
and there's nothing.

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,240
Tong, do you know

47
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,279
if there are any other ones?

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,680
You've had a busy day,
and you must be tired.

49
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,240
Stop thinking about it for now
and go back to your room to rest.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,279
Yuwei, give me the card.

51
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,279
Didn't we just confirm it?

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,439
I've already deleted the parts.

53
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,279
Didn't you see it too?

54
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,319
Don't you trust me?

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,720
The point is...

56
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,480
I didn't even play
the video from that day.

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Besides,

58
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,160
Zhou Mo was standing right behind us.

59
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,920
How could I let him see it?

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
You had someone
change the will in the study

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
and got rid of Mr. Lin...

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,399
Good girl. Give it to me.

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,920
Take it. Confirm it yourself,

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
since you don't trust me.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,079
If I can't trust you,

66
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,879
who else can I trust?

67
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,600
You know who's good to you, right?

68
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,759
Qin Moyao, you have no humanity.

69
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,160
You tied me up at your house all day
and have just returned.

70
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,199
Aren't you afraid I'd starve to death?

71
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,560
If you hadn't tried to stop me,

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,496
would I need to do it?

73
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,879
Lin Guofu is your family's enemy.

74
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,360
You went to be his daughter's bodyguard.

75
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,000
Even a fool could guess
what you're up to.

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,480
How could I not stop you?

77
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,199
Don't worry.
I won't abuse your identity.

78
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,079
Am I worried about myself?

79
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm worried about you.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
By the way,
did you get the document this time?

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,959
Lin Guofu transferred it

82
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,399
after he caught me.

83
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,000
Now that the only evidence

84
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,759
proving his malicious acquisition
of the Qin family is gone,

85
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,519
and he was dead,

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
how can you seek justice for your father

87
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,480
and your group?

88
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,199
Let yourself go, okay?

89
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,079
Zhou Mo, I might need your identity

90
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,160
for a few more days.

91
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,000
Qin Moyao, what else do you want to do?

92
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,759
Lin Guofu loved his daughter the most.

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,439
Perhaps only his daughter knows.

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,920
But now she insists
that I'm her father's killer.

95
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,959
I have to go back,

96
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,920
gain her trust first,
and then get the acquisition documents.

97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,240
Qin Moyao, that blind heiress
isn't easy to deal with.

98
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
Don't be trapped by her.

99
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,920
Miss Lin, you're awake.

100
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,800
Mr. Chi told me
to place a fresh white rose

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
beside your bed and prepare your coffee

103
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,279
before you wake up.

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,279
Dark chocolate-flavored espresso.

105
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,839
Double shot latte at 85 degrees Celsius.

106
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,639
I won't drink it. Get out of here.

107
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,079
With the proof of your beloved father

108
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,680
and your most trusted fiance,

109
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,759
you still don't believe me?

110
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't try to deceive me.

111
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,000
People who can't see
have the sharpest feelings.

112
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,920
My intuition is never wrong.

113
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,759
You're really stubborn.

114
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,519
Since you can't see,

115
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,399
you shouldn't judge a person
with your eyes,

116
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,319
but with your heart.

117
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,679
What are you doing?

118
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm taking you to have breakfast.

119
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,519
Don't bother. I can walk myself.

120
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,672
Be careful.

121
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,879
Miss Lin, you should
take good care of yourself

122
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,799
to put your father's mind at ease.

123
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,000
Tong, be careful.

124
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,799
Come and have breakfast.

125
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,840
This is the porridge
I personally cooked for you.

126
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,679
Where's Chi Shan?

127
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,039
He left early in the morning
to deal with some shareholder issues.

128
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,960
Tong, you're not very mobile now.

129
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,600
I've cleaned up the large suite
near the elevator

130
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,519
on the third floor for you.

131
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,759
It will be more convenient
for you to move in and out.

132
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,799
I have also moved in

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,279
to take care of you for a few days.

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
Yuwei, thank you
for being so thoughtful.

135
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,159
Without you taking care of me,

136
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,320
I wouldn't know
if I could get through it.

137
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,960
No need to be so polite with me.

138
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,559
