(It's Okay, and Don't Cry)

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,399
You don't have to do anything.

5
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,200
Just stay like this.

6
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,600
Listen to me.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,759
When I give you the signal,

8
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,039
you run to the back.

9
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,920
Run as fast as you can,

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,759
and don't look back.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,159
Go find the car

12
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,000
and drive away.

13
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:00,920
Got it?

14
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,840
What's wrong?

15
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,239
There's no time to explain right now.

16
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,120
Just do as I say.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,239
Go.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,239
Go.

19
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,519
You're hurt.

20
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,799
Did you call the police?

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,120
No.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,000
There was no time.

23
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,719
I left the headlights on,

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,560
thinking they wouldn't see me
against the light.

25
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
I played a siren sound on my phone.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,039
Smart thinking.

27
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,280
Let's leave first.

28
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm afraid they might come back.

29
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,240
Okay.

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,319
Does it hurt?

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
No.

32
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,520
It's okay.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,159
Are you sure?

34
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,240
Won't it get infected?

35
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,319
Maybe we should
still go to the hospital.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,039
Don't worry.

37
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,800
Did you forget it?

38
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,840
If I were really infected,

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,479
would I still be sitting here?

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,439
Don't worry.

41
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,879
I'm a professional.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,199
How come you know how to do everything?

43
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,759
Was that man today

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
sent to kill me?

45
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,759
They came for me.

46
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,919
For you?

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,599
Why?

48
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,560
It's normal for someone like me

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
to get into trouble.

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,879
Xintong,

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
can you promise me something?

52
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,520
Go ahead.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,439
If,

54
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,199
I mean,

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,639
if something happens to me
and I'm not by your side,

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
promise me

57
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,759
that you'll stop looking
for evidence of Chi Shan's murder

58
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,879
and just call the police.

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
He might get sentenced

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,639
to 10 or 15 years for fraud,

61
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,000
and then you just stop.

62
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,240
You need to minimize the potential harm

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,280
to yourself.

64
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,840
Forget about all this

65
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,080
and start afresh somewhere else.

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,400
What...

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,280
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,840
I can't promise you that.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,759
Lin Xintong.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,400
I can't.

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,199
Because...

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,759
Because you won't be in danger.

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,279
Qin Moyao,

74
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,319
you have to be okay.

75
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,639
We'll sign an additional agreement.

76
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,399
I...

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
I won't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,519
If something really happens to you,

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,759
I will deduct all your salary.

man up

105
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,839
and come at only me.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,879
Qin Moyao,

107
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,720
are you wrong about one thing?

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,120
On the contract I gave
to the Jixing Organization,

109
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,120
there are the names
of both you and Lin Xintong.

110
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,319
Neither of you can escape.

111
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,959
I'm telling you.

112
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,959
If you hurt her,

113
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,079
I'll make you wish you were dead.

114
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,519
Then I'm curious to see

115
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,360
how capable you are.

116
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,319
You can protect her,

117
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,360
but what about your mom?

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240
What did you say?

119
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
Getting worked up?

120
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,800
Then beg me.

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
You know about the Jixing Organization.

122
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,839
If the client doesn't cancel,

123
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,560
they will carry out the task
until it's complete.

124
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,480
How about it?

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,199
Beg me.

126
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,519
Try it.

127
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,639
Chi Shan,

128
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,839
don't push it too much.

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm not in the mood
to play cat and mouse with you.

130
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
I do know

131
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,319
about that organization.

132
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,920
If the client dies, the order
is automatically canceled.

133
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,120
Believe it or not,

134
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:11,920
I can make you disappear
from the world right now.

135
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,319
Don't.

136
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,720
Calm down.

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,519
Calm down, Qin Moyao.

138
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,439
Calm down.

139
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,279
We both know each other's secrets.

140
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
Let there be peace between us.

141
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,399
How about this?

142
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,360
Let's make a deal.

143
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,120
What do you think?

144
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
Go ahead.

145
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,000
First,

146
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,600
I want all the Hongfu shares
in your hands.

147
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,680
Second,

148
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,079
leave Lin's house

149
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
and leave Lin Xintong.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,439
Two conditions for two lives.

151
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,680
Fair, right?

152
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,639
Besides,

153
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,439
I'll give

154
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,240
all my 60 million

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,199
to you.

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,959
I won't leave Lin Xintong.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
I won't hurt her.

158
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,800
Why would I go through
all this trouble to hurt her

159
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,959
if I could easily get
the shares of Hongfu?

160
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Deal.

161
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,959
When will you give them to me?

162
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,639
Once I'm sure
you can fulfill your promise.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Qin Moyao,

164
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,680
you've already fooled me many times.

165
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,079
This time,

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,680
won't you show your sincerity?

167
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,879
Do you think you're trustworthy?

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How about this?

169
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll order them to stop for now.

170
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,759
You leave Lin Xintong

171
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,799
in three days.

172
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,000
