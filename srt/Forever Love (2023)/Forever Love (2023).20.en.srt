=Episode 20=

3
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:35,520
(It's a Gift and Also an Answer)

4
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,280
Why don't you come in?

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,719
Aren't you asleep?

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,159
I'm waiting for midnight.

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,280
Don't be too touched.

8
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,519
This is just an employee benefit.

9
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,959
How do you know it is my birthday?

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,159
Your ID information

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,640
is on the contract you signed.

12
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,239
But how can you be sure
that it is real?

13
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,200
You're not lying to me again, are you?

14
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,280
Just kidding.

15
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,640
It seems like I haven't celebrated
my birthday for many years.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,680
In that case,

17
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,040
make a wish now.

18
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,640
Have you made your wish?

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,439
I've already made it in my heart.

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:10,800
Then

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,159
b-b-blow out the candles.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,159
Where's my gift?

23
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,919
Isn't the cake a gift?

24
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,960
What else do you want?

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,919
Lin Xintong,

26
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,240
I've saved you several times.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,840
You think just a cake can satisfy me?

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Then what else do you want?

29
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,159
How about you give me a kiss

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,319
as a gift?

31
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,960
Okay?

32
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,479
Qin Moyao,

33
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,800
you're really shameless.

34
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,400
After all, you know I like you,

35
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,560
so what's the use of shame?

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,280
Did your wound open up?

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Qin Moyao,

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
I didn't expect you to be like this.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,439
Let it hurt.

40
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,560
Happy birthday.

41
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,240
Xintong,

42
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,879
thank you.

43
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,000
You're getting more proficient.

44
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,560
Next time I'll teach you more.

45
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,240
If I get injured again,

46
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,480
you can help me stitch up.

47
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,480
You might as well
teach me some self-defense.

48
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,519
So when you're fighting,

49
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,560
I can help you.

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,160
There's no such thing as self-defense,

51
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,600
unless you've undergone long periods
of professional training.

52
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,160
Xintong,

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
if you encounter danger again next time,

54
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,920
and if I'm not by your side...

55
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,920
Why are you saying such things again?

56
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,560
If I'm in danger,
dare you not be by my side?

57
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,199
The penalty in our contract

58
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,680
is very high.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,639
You can't escape.

60
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,000
Alright.

61
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,439
Oh, right, Xintong,

62
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,160
is there anything you really want to do?

63
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
What is it?

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,759
Just tell me.

65
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
Why is there also a scar
on your lower back?

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,959
Wake up!

67
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,360
Wake up!

68
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
There's a fire.

69
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,360
Hurry up. Wake up!

70
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,839
Come out!

71
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,800
Wake up.

72
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Hurry up.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
Girl, wake up.

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,519
Hey, there's a fire.

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,439
Don't go there.

76
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,360
Fire.

77
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,959
Fire. Leave!

78
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,639
Go!

79
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,360
Move away, young man.

80
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,240
It's open.

81
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,439
Open it.

82
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,160
Hurry.

83
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,439
The fire is getting bigger.

84
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,040
Come on.

85
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,879
It's too dangerous.
The fire is getting bigger.

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,959
Young man, be careful.

87
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,279
Did she faint?

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
Don't explode!

89
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,759
She's out.

90
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,120
Get out, young man. Hurry up.

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,639
Go.

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,639
Run.

93
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,680
It's going to explode.

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
It's going to explode. Run!

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,759
Go.

96
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,959
Stop watching.

97
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,040
Run. It's going to explode.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,879
She's finally out.

99
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,160
I need an ambulance.

100
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,480
There's been a car accident.

101
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,879
This is Hubin Road.

102
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,759
Hang in there.

103
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,439
Hold on.

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,839
The ambulance will be here soon.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
I was naughty as a boy

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
and fell when climbing a tree.

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
Xintong,

108
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,319
we've been on edge for so long.

109
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,480
Let's take a day off today.

110
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,639
Let's forget Chi Shan for now.

111
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,279
What do you want to do?

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,240
I'll accompany you.

113
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,199
Okay.

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,319
I'm really surprised

115
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,920
that the thing you want to do

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,240
is actually watching the sunset.

117
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,720
When I was a kid,

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
whenever my dad had time,

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
he would do it with me.

120
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,480
So Mr. Lin is a good father too.

121
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,839
He is the best father in the world.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,959
Lin Xintong,

123
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,959
I've already fulfilled your wish.

124
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,279
Then shouldn't you now answer

125
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,600
the question you didn't answer before?

126
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,759
You said you didn't
think clearly before.

127
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,160
Have you thought it through now?

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,000
I thought my answer was very clear

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,720
last night.

130
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,240
Happy birthday.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
I'm so stupid.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
Then I'll say it again.

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,159
I've thought it through.

135
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm very clear.

136
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,320
Just like when you said you like me.

137
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,696
I'm absolutely sure.
