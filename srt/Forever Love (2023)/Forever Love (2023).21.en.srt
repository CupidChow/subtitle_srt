00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,800
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,424
(You Bad Man, You Kissed and Ran)

4
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,439
You're strange

5
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,719
today.

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,679
I'm not.

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,079
You won't leave me, will you?

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,319
I will do

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,879
what I promised you.

10
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,159
I've left.

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
(Resignation Letter)
Take care.

12
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,159
You will get used to it.

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Sorry,

14
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,719
the number you dialed
is temporarily out of service.

15
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,919
Please try again later.

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Sorry,

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,280
the number you dialed
is temporarily out of service.

18
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Please try again later.

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
Qin Moyao,

20
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,919
who allowed you to resign?

21
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,960
You

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,280
get back to me right now!

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,960
Qin Moyao,

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
you are joking with me, right?

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
Have I treated you too well recently?

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,960
Stop joking.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,759
Come back now.

28
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,159
Qin Moyao,

29
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,000
don't forget

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
you sold yourself to me.

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,599
You owe me a huge amount of penalty.

32
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,080
You can't just run away like this.

33
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you hear me?

34
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:40,640
(Transfer Record)

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,199
Qin Moyao,

36
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,960
you're rich now, huh?

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
You think you can leave me?

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
If you dare, say something.

39
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,800
As far as I know,

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,800
no one has survived

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,599
the three attacks
of the Jixing Organization.

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
You are simply courting death!

43
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,599
Chi Shan said he would cancel

44
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,280
the order in three days,

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
but knowing him as I do,

46
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,879
he's very likely to go back on his word.

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,480
To eliminate the threat
to Xintong from the source,

48
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,839
I must withstand these three attacks.

49
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,399
After Jixing Organization
tears up the contract,

50
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,680
Chi Shan will have no way.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
Qin Moyao,

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,439
can't you think more about yourself?

53
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,000
Look at these documents.

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,319
What are these?

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
All my property

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,319
and the 60 million of Xintong

57
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,360
that I got from Chi Shan.

58
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,120
If something really happens to me,

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
you pay her back for me.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,399
But before that,

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
you'd better wish me success.

62
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,279
I've entrusted her safety to you.

63
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,959
Qin Moyao,

64
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,680
what are you talking about?

65
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,519
You sound like
you're leaving a last will!

66
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,120
Don't get excited.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,079
I'm just fine.

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm doing this just in case.

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,959
Just in case.

70
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,279
Just in case what?

71
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,600
Take these back,

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,040
and I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

73
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,800
The Hongfu shares I bought in your name.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,839
Just keep them.

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,639
After all,

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
I might still need you
to take care of my mom.

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,959
Qin Moyao.

78
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,160
By the way,

79
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,560
I always thought
Chi Shan only wanted money,

80
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,879
but what he really wants
is the Hongfu Group.

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,079
He even handed me that 60 million.

82
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,360
There must be a secret

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,759
between him and Lin Guofu.

84
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,839
Check it out for me.

85
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,519
If you find something,

86
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,560
don't tell Xintong.

87
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,439
Do whatever you want.

88
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,000
Qin Moyao,

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
I warn you.

90
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,319
You must...

91
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:55,800
Alright.

92
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:57,959
Eat.

93
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,240
It'll be cold.

94
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Remember to do the dishes.

95
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,439
Bad man.

96
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:25,639
He really took everything with him.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,959
Don't ever come back since you've left.

98
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,072
Hang in there. Hold on.

99
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:52,680
The ambulance will be here soon.

100
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
There's been a car accident.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,920
This is Hubin Road.

102
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,959
Why is there also a scar
on your lower back?

103
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,439
I was naughty as a boy

104
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
and fell when climbing a tree.

105
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,279
Liar.

106
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,959
Zhou Mo,

107
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,600
with your dimwitted brain,

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
how did you become
friends with Qin Moyao?

109
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,079
Who would have thought

110
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,480
that a rich lady would have

111
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,240
such countersurveillance skills?

112
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,279
Fine,

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
you win.

114
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,879
I gotta go.

115
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,560
Wait.

116
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,439
You're going to see Qin Moyao, right?

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,160
We go together.

118
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,759
Who said it?

119
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,040
Isn't Qin Moyao at your house?

120
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,920
You need to make it more believable.

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,399
Would you have followed me

122
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,600
if Qin Moyao hadn't asked?

123
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,040
Did he ask you to protect me?

124
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,759
I don't know.

125
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,839
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

126
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,959
Miss Lin,

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,319
I haven't signed
any servitude contract with you.

128
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,839
Don't order me around.

129
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,399
Don't you know where his house is?

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,279
Go find him yourself.

131
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,199
If he were willing
to open the door for me,

132
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,800
would I need you?

133
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,519
I don't care.

134
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,279
I'm just going to follow you.

135
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,879
Wherever you go, I go.

136
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't believe you two won't meet.

137
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,679
Do it if you want.

138
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,480
As you wish.

139
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:51,072
(Death Contract)

140
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,360
(According to our principle,)

141
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,799
(you survived our three attacks,)

142
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,240
(so the contract
on your and that woman's lives)

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,799
(is invalid now.)

144
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,559
(Qin Moyao,)

145
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,879
(you're pretty good.)

146
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,840
(You're the only one who did it.)

147
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,399
Hey,

148
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
what's wrong?

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,879
Qin Moyao,

150
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,679
you better get back here.

151
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,840
If you don't, your woman will die.

152
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,600
Qin Moyao.

153
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,440
Qin Moyao,

154
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,799
you're back.

155
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,679
Qin Moyao,

156
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,679
don't blame me.

157
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,120
She can really hold her liquor.

158
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
I lost.

159
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,440
I had no choice but to call you back.

160
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,679
If you don't come back, I'll die.

161
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm leaving.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,679
You two do whatever you want.

163
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,120
I don't care anymore.

164
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,120
You're drunk.

165
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,840
I'll take you home first.

166
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
Home?

167
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,000
Whose home?

168
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Yours.

169
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,679
I'm not going.

170
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
You're drunk.

171
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,120
Be good.

172
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,639
Let's go home first.

173
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,000
We can talk about everything tomorrow.

174
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,639
Qin Moyao,

175
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,840
you're a liar.

176
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,919
You kissed me and ran,

177
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,320
and now you want to chase me away.

178
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:42,336
I didn't lie to you.

179
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:44,360
I didn't abandon you either.

180
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,440
I just have my own things to deal with.

181
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,559
Really?

182
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,159
Then what about this?

183
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,480
This?

184
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,759
How did you get this scar?

185
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,279
Here.

186
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,960
You know it?

187
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,080
Why did you lie to me?

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,399
You said before that Chi Shan
was the one who saved you.

189
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,080
I told myself

190
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,559
that if one day I grow on you,
