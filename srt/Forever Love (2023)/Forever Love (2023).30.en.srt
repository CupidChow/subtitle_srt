(Grand Comeback)

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,280
You lost.

5
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,039
Not yet.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,479
I haven't started yet.

7
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,360
Qin Moyao!

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,719
You are just in time.

9
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,719
Hang in there.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,359
Let me go.

11
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,159
Qin Moyao.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,879
I'm telling you, Chi Shan.

13
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,280
I have called the police.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,879
If you don't want to go to jail,

15
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,319
you should let me go now.

16
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:14,959
Get lost.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Call the police?

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,280
Let her go.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,719
If you really did that,

20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,519
they should be here by now, right?

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,239
Let me guess.

22
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,239
You're probably afraid

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,079
that he might accidentally kill me,

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,599
or that I'll provide evidence
against him,

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,159
so you dare not call the police.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,959
You

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,519
let her go.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,519
Let her go?

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,840
Alright.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
You kneel down and beg me now,

31
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,719
and I will let her go.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,439
Kneel down!

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,079
No.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,319
Don't.

35
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,799
No.

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,400
No.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Mo.

38
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,000
Mo.

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,919
No.

40
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,680
Lin Xintong,

41
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,280
we were supposed to get married today.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,599
Let him be our witness then.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,599
Let him go.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Mo.

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,520
Mo.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't worry.

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,400
It's half an inch from the heart,

48
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
so you won't die.

49
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,000
You have to live

50
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,800
to face the penalty of your crimes.

51
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,840
This time,

52
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,240
you lost again.

53
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,599
Mo.

54
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,599
Mo.

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Qin Moyao.

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,479
Hang in there.

57
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,639
Hang in there.

58
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,960
I'll stop the bleeding for you.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll stop the bleeding.

60
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,199
I'll stop it.

61
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
Let me stop the bleeding.

62
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,759
You taught me this.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,159
Silly girl.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,120
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,919
How did you get out?

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,439
Don't talk.

67
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,800
Don't.

68
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm calling an ambulance.

69
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:30,839
Hello?

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,199
Someone is injured.

71
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,600
A stab wound.

72
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm at the warehouse next to Wanfu Road.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,519
Yes.

74
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,480
Please hurry.

75
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,439
Don't worry.

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm fine.

77
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,519
I won't die.

78
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,800
Okay.

79
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

80
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,079
Okay.

81
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,160
Mo.

82
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,360
Mo,

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,240
wake up.

84
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,920
Mo.

85
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,199
You can't sleep.

86
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,720
You can't sleep.

87
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,600
Wake up. The ambulance is coming.

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
It's almost here.

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,079
Mo.

90
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,959
Mo.

91
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,839
Mo.

92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,560
Mo.

93
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,879
Don't leave me alone.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,439
Don't leave me alone.

95
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,519
Mo.

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't scare me.

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,279
Wake up, okay?

98
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,279
Mo.

99
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,120

(committed the crimes of intentional homicide,
intentional injury, and theft.)

of political rights.)

108

it's about the time.

109
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,240
