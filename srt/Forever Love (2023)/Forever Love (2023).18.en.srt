00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:29,952
=Forever Love=

2
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:32,640
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,424
(I'll Take It Seriously
If You Keep Doing This)

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,759
Oh,

5
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,240
and also the death of Lin Guofu.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,079
What nonsense are you talking about?

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,600
Lin Guofu's death was just an accident.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,560
Whether it was an accident or not,
we'll know once we investigate.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,439
Digoxin poisoning can be detected.

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,000
You should still remember
that before the burial,

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,640
Lin Xintong retained

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,519
a strand of Lin Guofu's hair, right?

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,200
Let me dial the number for you?

14
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,519
You lost

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,879
this round.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Remember the money you owe me.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,359
Are you sure he will take the bait?

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Probably.

19
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,000
He's already feeling guilty today.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
If...

21
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
He really went there.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,639
He would know once he checks

23
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,560
that Digoxin poisoning

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
decomposes entirely
in twenty-four hours.

25
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,360
We didn't do
blood and electrolyte tests.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,240
It's impossible to detect it now.

27
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,199
And it's even less possible
to detect it through hair.

28
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,520
I was just testing him.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,919
He's feeling guilty and too anxious.

30
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,039
Now,

31
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,719
although we've confirmed he did it,

32
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,039
to bring him to justice,

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,120
we still need to find concrete evidence.

34
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,080
How's your work going?

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,319
I've checked everything.

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,479
His medical records are normal.

37
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,840
Same with his internet accounts.

38
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,800
I've even checked his external
communication information and deliveries.

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,439
There's no record

40
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,879
of purchasing
and receiving prescription drugs.

41
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,879
What about Xia Yuwei?

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
Can't you find anything either?

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
Or do they have some kind of code,

44
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,919
disguised as something else?

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,599
Isn't it how they illegally buy drugs?

46
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,800
Miss Lin, do you think I'm useless?

47
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,360
Wouldn't I carefully discern?

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
But,

49
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,800
your dad

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,240
had regular records of buying Digoxin.

51
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,000
What's so strange about that?

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
My dad has heart disease.

53
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,879
He regularly went to
the hospital for medicine.

54
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,120
But Digoxin is a prescription drug.

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
You can only prescribe
a week's dose at a time.

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,400
Without concrete evidence,

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,159
we can only start from somewhere else.

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,360
Don't worry.

59
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,759
I'll figure it out.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Chi Shan.

61
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,959
Who is it?

62
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,800
Tong.

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
It's me.

64
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,879
Chi Shan,

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,439
why aren't you talking?

66
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,560
You scared me.

67
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,800
Why are you here?

68
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Do you need me?

69
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,399
I came to get the seal back from you.

70
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,720
The seal?

71
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,079
Right.

72
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,000
Isn't my seal here?

73
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,319
I need it.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,720
(I think Tong...)

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
(She might be able to see.)

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,519
Don't move.

77
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,720
There's something in your hair.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me help you take it out.

79
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,720
Okay.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is it done yet?

81
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Yes.

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,839
Then give me the seal.

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
I'll get it for you now.

84
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,879
The item is returned to its owner.

85
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,800
You must keep it safe.

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,439
Don't worry.

87
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,399
Miss Lin,

88
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,319
it's time for your medicine.

89
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,639
Qin Moyao.

90
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,000
I...

91
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
Why didn't you listen to me?

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,480
I'm asking you,
why didn't you listen to me?

93
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,360
Didn't you promise me

94
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
that you wouldn't act alone?

95
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,879
I...

96
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,879
I'm really worried about you

97
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,079
if you act like this.

98
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,040
I just

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,240
want to find the evidence quickly.

100
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,319
Didn't I say I would figure it out?

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,439
I don't want you
to take risks for me anymore.

130

Leave with me right now.

spend money to take my life.

134
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,759

135
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,919
how much my life is worth.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,679
It is not a joke.

137
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,639
Zhou Mo,

138
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,639
I won't die that easily.

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,559
Chi Shan wouldn't
spend money on my life.

140
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,679
It's not worth it.

141
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,559
They don't want you to die.

142
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,600
They want you to live worse than death.

143
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,399
Zhou Mo,

144
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,720
you're overthinking it.

145
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,519
I've trained for so many years

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,039
and I've studied medicine.

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,240
It's not that easy to make me disabled.

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
What about Lin Xintong?

149
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,399
She's with you every day.

150
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,960
Can you guarantee
that she won't be involved?

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,080
Listen to me.
Let's not deal with this anymore.

152
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,159
You now have shares in Hongfu Group,

153
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,840
and evidence of Lin Guofu's fraud.

154
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,639
Your task is already completed.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,039
Don't put yourself in there anymore,

156
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,960
okay?

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,720
Hello?

158
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,919
What?

159
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll be right there.

160
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,919
What happened?

161
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,720
Is there an emergency?

162
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,840
Something happened at my mom's place.

163
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,679
I have to go there.

164
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
I'll go with you.

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,159
Okay.

166
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,000
Auntie must have missed you.

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,679
Once you were there,

168
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,000
her blood pressure
and values stabilized.

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,799
Next week, let's buy some flowers

170
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,000
and come see Auntie again.

171
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,279
Okay.

172
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,480
You must have a rough time
by yourself back then.

173
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,840
If it weren't for me,

174
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
she probably wouldn't have collapsed.

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
At my dad's funeral,

176
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,679
those debt collectors
forced me to kneel.

177
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,000
My mom kept stopping me

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,919
in front of me.

179
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
She wouldn't let me kneel.

180
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,039
She said it was
our family's last bit of dignity.

181
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,159
Did you kneel?

182
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,440
Yes.

183
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,799
When I kneeled,

184
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
my mom collapsed too.

185
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,919
Since then I feel like
I've become a different person.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
Without feelings and attachment.

187
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
I have to lower myself

188
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,879
and take any job and do anything.

189
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,279
Only by that,

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,840

198
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,360
if you want to cry,

199
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,759
just cry it out.

200
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,159
Would that make you
feel a little better?

201
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,799
You don't have to do anything.

202
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,559
