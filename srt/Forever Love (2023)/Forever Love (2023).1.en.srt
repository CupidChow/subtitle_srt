00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,760
(Taking It Off)

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,439
They've arrived.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Let them in.

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,848
Roger.

7
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,239
Miss Lin, here we are.

8
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,599
Okay, got it.

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,920
Is it Chi Shan?

10
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,640
Miss Lin, Mr. Chi wants to talk to you.

11
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:31,840
Hello.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,599
Tong, don't come in. It's a trap.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This place...

14
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,200
Chi Shan. Hello.

15
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,920
- Miss Lin.
- Miss Lin.

16
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,159
Miss Lin, there's a board meeting today.

17
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,480
Mr. Lin stipulated

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,640
no bodyguards were allowed
at the board meeting.

19
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,840
Zhou Mo, you stay here.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,624
Miss Lin.

21
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,840
They won't get the guts
to do anything to me.

22
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,240
If there's danger, you just press this.

23
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,199
Miss Lin, I'll take you in.

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,039
Miss Lin,
we've arrived at the conference room.

25
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,560
Tong, run!

26
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,800
Stay where you are!

27
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,199
Chi Shan, where are you?

28
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,719
Don't hurt her.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,856
Tong.

30
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,599
Don't hurt her.

31
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,912
Tong.

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,919
Chi Shan, are you okay?

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,912
I'm okay.

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,439
Miss Lin,

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,800
your fiance seems
to care a lot about you.

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
What do you want to do?

37
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,599
(Share Transfer Agreement)

38
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,479
Your father passed away unexpectedly.

39
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,080
Such a big group

40
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,759
can't be managed by a blind person.

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,360
We have discussed it.

42
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,560
We could possibly manage it for you.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,120
Just sign this share transfer agreement
right away,

44
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,280
so as not to ruin the Hongfu Group
that your father founded.

45
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,680
What if I don't sign?

46
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,360
Once you come here,
you can't decide anymore.

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,800
Who dares to mess with me?
This is Hongfu.

48
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,600
Let go of me!

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,560
Tong!

50
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,040
- Sit down.
- Let go of me.

51
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,023
Tong!

52
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,879
I'll give all my shares to you.

53
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,079
I don't even care

54
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,079
about your little share.

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
Shut him up!

56
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,560
Get up!

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,760
Chi Shan.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
Let go of me.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,128
Chi Shan.

60
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,399
(If there's danger,
you just press this.)

61
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,928
Let go of me!

62
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,264
Don't move!

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,399
- Let go!
- Let go!

64
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,072
(Mourning)

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,080
Tong.

66
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,744
Tong.

67
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,600
Seeing you so filial,

68
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll burn it for your father.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,079
Burn it!

70
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,399
Don't. Give it back to me.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,959
Give it back to me.

72
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,448
Father.

73
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,639
Tong.

74
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,439
Father.

75
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,839
You can't even keep
your father's last dignity.

76
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,319
What can you keep?

77
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,839
No, father.

78
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,576
No.

79
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:56,600
Father.

80
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,024
Get up.

81
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:58,644
(Share Transfer Agreement)

82
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,240
Miss Lin, I'm sorry.

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,519
Stop them!

84
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,240
Don't let them leave the room.
Hurry up!

85
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,399
Go over there.

86
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,720
- They're...
- Be quiet!

87
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
- Go find them!
- Be quiet!

88
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,600
Where's the one in black?

89
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,079
Help! Help!

90
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,039
You're the one
who broke into my house that day.

91
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
What are you talking about?

92
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,919
You're the murderer
who killed my father.

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
Stop, stop!

94
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,679
Please don't. I'll give you

95
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,799
whatever you want.

96
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,799
What if I want you dead?

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,480
Let go of my father!

98
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,759
Tong, don't come here.

99
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,399
They're here!

100
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,399
You killed my father!

101
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,559
No!

102
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,080
You killed my father. It was you!

103
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,159
Miss Lin, you're awake.

104
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,919
Why are you here?

105
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,759
You've been having a fever
since you came back.

106
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,919
You are still having a fever.

107
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,960
This is the medicine
the doctor prescribed. Take it.

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,840
I won't take it. Get out of here.

109
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,440
How dare you? You're fired!

110
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,799
That's not up to you.

111
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,159
I was commissioned by your father
and I got paid by him.

112
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,480
If you want to fire me,

113
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,840
you need to let him terminate
the contract with me.

114
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,600
You're talking nonsense!
How could my father possibly hire you,

115
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,159
a murderer?

116
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,879
Zhou Mo, I'll pay you
three times the market price.

117
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,399
I hope you can protect Tong for me.

118
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,480
This is the payment
and contract for five years.

119
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Did you hear that?

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
You can't even recognize

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,159
your father's voice, right?

122
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,399
Your excuse won't work.

123
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

124
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
Miss Lin, what do I need to do
to make you believe me?

125
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,472
Proof.

126
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,919
How do I prove it?

127
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,360
- Help!
- Be quiet.

128
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,559
- It's in Miss Lin's room.
- Help!

129
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,279
- Go check it out.
- Help, over here.

130
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,039
Sorry for the disturbance.

131
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,559
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,312
