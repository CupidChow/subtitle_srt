Qin Moyao.

5
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,479
Why did you bring me to see Ms. Wang?

6
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,960
Someone thinks I killed her father.

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,840
I want to clear my name.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,280
I don't deserve it.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,719
When my dad died,
Yuwei and Chi Shan were there.

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,239
Why did Yuwei say

13
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,319
that nobody but my dad had been
to the study for those few days?

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,959
Why did you enter quietly?

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,400
I am changing my clothes.

16
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,599
I can't see anything.

17

You're overthinking.

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,920
Miss Lin, what can I do for you?

19
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,480
I want to drink.

20
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,120
I won't drink.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,400
You watch me drink.

22
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,680
Slow down.

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,039
I can't figure it out.

24
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,439
Why did Chi Shan and Yuwei lie?

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,599
Miss Lin,

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,439
have you really
never suspected Chi Shan?

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,840
Chi Shan?

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
Right after Mr. Lin passed away,

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,000
he was in a hurry to have the funeral.

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,159
Moreover, the shareholders decided to

31
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,879
transfer the shares
to him instead of you.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
And,

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
he was there.

62

63
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,400

on his lower waist to save me.

65

And over the past years,

76
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,600
he has truly treated me well.

77
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,639
(I figured out those numbers.)

78
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,000

(The information you're looking for)

00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,079

No.

00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480

94
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,240
Never mind.

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,079

00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,560
It's been several days
since we last met.

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,519

Tong,

100
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,399
I've been busy lately,

102
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,240
helping Chi Shan
with the group's affairs,

103
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,079
so I've neglected you.

104
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,399
By the way,

105
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,839
you keep the memory card
from the surveillance camera

106
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,000
in my dad's study, right?

107
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,439
Can you give it to me?

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Tong,

109
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,480
why did you suddenly want that?

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,040
Haven't we already checked it before?

111
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,279
I just want to preserve it.

112
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,720
After all, it contains

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,800
the last image of my dad.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,920
I hope I can see him again

115
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,879
if I get my sight back one day.

116
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,519
Tong.

118
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,480
I thought we had checked it out

119
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,439
and the card was useless,

120
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,920
so I threw it away.

121
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,879
You threw it away?

122
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,079
Why didn't you tell me?

123
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,600
At that time,

124
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,560
I didn't want you
to think about this anymore,

125
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,759
so I...

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,560
Are you sure you can't find it?

127
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,279
I did throw it away.

129
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,439
It's alright.

130
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,720
I have to go.

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,519
This way.

132
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,000
Could Lin Xintong be suspecting us?

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
Why did she suddenly want that card?

134
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,399
Oh,

135
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,000
a few days ago,

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,200
she gave me a USB drive,

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
asking me to check it.

138
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
It showed a person named Qin Moyao.

139
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,399
Could he have something to do with this?

140
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,840
Qin Moyao?

141
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,759
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

142
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,320
How did I know it mattered?

143
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,080
I thought the name sounded familiar,

144
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,519
but I didn't remember who he was.

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,559
It's the person
I hired to change the will.

146
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,000
In this case,

147
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,879
Lin Xintong learned about the will

148
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,159
from Qin Moyao,

149
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,759
so she suspects us.

150
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,000
No.

151
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,200
You said Lin Xintong got the news

152
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,720
that Zhou Mo is not the "Zhou Mo".

153
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,759
His name is Qin Moyao.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,919
Could Zhou Mo be Qin Moyao?

155
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
Just in case,

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,840
go investigate Qin Moyao.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,840
Yuwei just lied.

158
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,200
Why?

159
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,679
Who's it?

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,919
It's me.

161
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,399
Qin Moyao.

162
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,720
Do you have any hacker friends,

163
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,759
who can investigate
people's backgrounds?

164
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,120
Who are you going to investigate?

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,279
Xia Yuwei.

166
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,159
I'm going to have dinner with a friend.

167
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,159
Do you want to join us?

168
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,519
It's on me.

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,919
How's the investigation going?

170
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,039
He's the one
who came to change the will.

171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,679
And he's also the heir to the Qin Group

172
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,240
that went bankrupt a few years ago.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
Go ahead.

174
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,679
What is this?

175
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,759
Is it clean?

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,159
It's not poisonous,

177
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,240
even tastier than the fancy food.

178
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,679
Try it.

179
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,320
Why did you bring her here?

180
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,960
She wants to pay you
to investigate someone,

181
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,600
so I introduce you to her.

182
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,519
Miss Lin,

183
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,440
this is Zhou Mo.

184
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,159
So you're Zhou Mo?

185
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,279
Yes.

186
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,679
I am Zhou Mo.

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,360
