00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,456
(If You Don't Need Me, I'll Let You Be)

4
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,880
Tong,

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,656
you're awake.

6
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,679
Tong,

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,719
you can see.

8
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,880
Tong,

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,359
when did your eyes heal?

10
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,520
Get out.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,600
If I hadn't gone to the hospital
to get your medication,

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,239
I wouldn't have known.

13
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,239
You don't have to be so hypocritical.

14
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,400
And don't think about lying to me.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,879
I saw you and Chi Shan in bed together.

16
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,280
Did you?

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,200
Yuwei,

18
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,760
so much has happened,

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,319
but we seem
to never have had a proper chat.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,280
Do you think we still need to talk?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,879
Yes.

22
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,920
For example,

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,359
you never really told me

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,519
why you suddenly wanted
to do that to me.

25
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,400
Lin Xintong,

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,240
it was not sudden.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,439
I've planned this

28
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,400
for a long time.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,439
A very long time.

30
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,280
What did I do

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,159
to make you hate me so much?

32
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,479
What did you do?

33
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,520
You can still remember

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
how we met, right?

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
Because of my father.

36
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,879
Because my father
is your father's driver.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
For so many years,

38
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,080
my father has been bowing
to your father.

39
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,160
When we were little,
he pointed at you and told me

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,919
you were the young lady,

41
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,159
and that I must serve you well
in the future,

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,400
just like he did to your father.

43
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,680
But I never treated you
as a subordinate.

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,759
I've always seen you as my bestie.

45
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,840
So what?

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,199
You've always been superior,

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
and I've been inferior.

48
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,240
I never thought

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,280
you would think like this.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
That's how I think.

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,560
In consideration
of our many years of acquaintance,

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,319
I'll tell you something.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,879
Qin Moyao, who is by your side,

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,879
used to even outrank you.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,759
Do you know

56
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,759
why the Qin Group went bankrupt?

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,000
It was because of your father.

58
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,919
He cheated them
and made them lose everything.

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,479
Impossible.

60
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,280
My father couldn't
have done such a thing.

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
You'll know if it's true

62
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,800
just by asking around.

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
When Hongfu took over Qin Group,

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
it was big news in the business world.

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Qin Shijie,
the chairman of the Qin Group,

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,319
was your father's
long-time comrade in arms.

67
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,120
His father committed suicide
because he couldn't handle

68
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,319
this blow.

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,959
Lin Xintong,

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,199
all the misfortunes
of the people around you

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,439
were caused by your father.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,199
Do you want to know
why God treats you this way?

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,839
Go with your father and ask him.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,759
Get up and eat.

75
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,079
Leave me alone.

76
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,160
Qin Moyao,

77
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,920
don't let me look down on you.

78
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,439
You won't get up?

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,079
I'll get rid of that woman now,

80
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,959
so you won't be here self-tormenting.

81
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
You can't go.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Qin Moyao,

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,959
don't forget

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,279
Chi Shan and Xia Yuwei
are still running wild out there.

85
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,439
If you like this,
how will you protect her?

86
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,600
She doesn't need me anymore.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,839
Stop lying to yourself.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,680
She needs you.

89
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,879
You know it in your heart.

90
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,040
Your order to kill them has been voided.

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,680
Don't call anymore.

92
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,399
Lin Xintong has long been able to see,

93
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,959
and she's already discovered our affair.

94
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,319
We can't delay any longer.

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
How's it going?

96
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,279
It's over.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,279
It's all over.

98
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,319
What does it mean?

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
Qin Moyao...

100
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
Qin Moyao has actually settled
the Jixing Organization.

101
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,839
What about the shares he promised you?

102
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
It turns out
that his negotiation with me

103
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,480
and saying he'd leave Lin's house

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
was just to buy himself time.

105
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,639
That bad guy.

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,839
He tricked me again!

107
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,759
I really have nothing left.

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
What about your shares?

109
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Don't you still own

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,519
18 percent of Hongfu's shares?

111
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,800
Although it's not much,
it's still worth quite a lot of money.

112
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
I've pledged them all to usurers.

113
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,199
Why?

114
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,800
I was thinking

115
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,800
I could pledge it for more money
when the stock price was high

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,439
and buy it back when it was low.

117
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,399
But...

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,959
But Qin Moyao did that before me.

119
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,639
If we pay back the money now,

120
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,879
can we redeem the shares?

121
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,319
Don't be so naive.

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,959
That's usury.

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,319
Do you know how much it is now?

124
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,839
How can I pay it back?

125
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,959
I was thinking of taking
Qin Moyao's shares,

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
and then everything would be easy.

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,040
What should we do now?

128
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,399
What do we do?

129
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
What do we do?

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
Tong.

131
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,600
I'll go to her.

132
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll go beg her for forgiveness now.

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
She can save me.

134
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
Let me solve this problem first.

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,480
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,639
How could she possibly forgive you?

137
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,759
There's still you.

138
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,079
You orchestrated all of this.

139
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,639
I'm innocent.

140
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,240
Chi Shan,

141
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,120
we've been together for so many years.

142
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
And now,

143
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,720
you want to let me be made a scapegoat.

144
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,879
Xia Yuwei,

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,679
you don't really think

146
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,879
I truly like you, do you?

147
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,559
I approached you

148
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,360
only to get to know Lin Xintong.

149
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,519
Chi Shan.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,039
I do know a lot of your secrets.

151
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:09,159
Aren't you afraid?

152
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,840
Yes,

153
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,639
you know me best.

154
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,080
You know what I'll do.

155
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,480
So I advise you

156
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,120
