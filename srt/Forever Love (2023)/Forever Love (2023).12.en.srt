3
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,488
(Visible Betrayal,
Invisible Deep Affection)

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,039
Miss Lin.

5
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,280
Lin Xintong!

6
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,719
Lin Xintong!

7
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,959
I told you before,

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,000
you must be careful
when getting out of the bathtub.

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,280
Are you hurt anywhere?

10
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,840
Qin Moyao.

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,159
After you saved me that day,

12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,879
you never asked me

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,560
why I was in the underground garage.

14
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,760
Aren't you curious?

15
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,760
What do you want to ask?

16
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,280
Chi Shan said those people
were hired by you.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,879
He also said
that you proposed a partnership

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,680
to cheat me out of my money.

19
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,040
What he said isn't true, right?

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,200
If you don't want to answer,

21
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,200
it means you admit it.

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
I didn't admit anything.

23
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,400
It's just that there are things

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,079
that it's better if you don't know.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,639
You were the one who said,

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,039
between a bodyguard and an employer,

27
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,560
there should be absolute trust.

28
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,199
But you never really

29
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,439
opened up to me.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,360
The duty of a bodyguard
is to protect the employer.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,280
Everything I did was to protect you.

32
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,159
All I want is just
an explanation from you.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,479
If you don't want to say anything,

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
you can leave.

35
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,599
What did you say?

36
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,599
I said

37
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,560
since you were not Zhou Mo,

38
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,360
you were not the bodyguard my dad hired.

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,639
So there's no contract between us.

40
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,719
You

41
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,439
can leave the Lin family now!

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,560
Since Miss Lin doesn't need me anymore,

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,319
I will leave.

44
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,080
I can see.

45
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,080
I can see.

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,840
I can see.

47
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,839
You're so bad.

48
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,040
(Tong,)

49
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
(I'll move in in a couple of days
to take care of you.)

50
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,120
(Tong, I'm always on your side.)

51
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,199
(Yuwei, you're also here.)

52
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,600
(Yuwei came to bring me medicine.)

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,680
(Is someone else in your room?)

54
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,120
(No.)

55
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,040
(Who told you
that Yuwei did something to you?)

56
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,800
(I questioned Yuwei.)

57
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,439
(Why are you so eager
to come out and explain?)

58
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,839
Tong,

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,199
how did you get here?

60
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,399
Tong,

61
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,560
you can see?

62
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,199
Are you alright?

63
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm fine.

64
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm fine.

65
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
I just had a nightmare.

66
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,240
I dreamed that my dad passed away

67
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,480
and you and Chi Shan
also wanted to leave me.

68
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,240
Will you leave me?

69
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,319
Tong,

70
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,920
how could we leave you?

71
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
That's good.

72
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,240
You can rest.

73
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm going back.

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,480
(But you'd better think about it.)

75
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
(Are the people around you)

76
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,759
(really worth trusting?)

77
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,199
(Have you never doubted Chi Shan?)

78
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,079
(Mr. Lin just passed away,)

79
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
(and he was eager to bury him.)

80
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,920
(When Mr. Lin died,)

81
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
(he was there, too.)

82
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,079
(Don't you think that all this)

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,800
(is worth your suspicion?)

84
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,560
(Are you saying that
when my father died,)

85
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,839
(Chi Shan and Yuwei were in his study?)

86
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,120
(So Mo saw early on)

87
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,079
(their betrayal of me.)

88
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,160
(So he warned me that the people
around me were suspicious.)

89
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,000
(Could it be that my father's death)

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,959
(really had something to do with them?)

91
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,639
(You were the one who said,)

92
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,240
(between a bodyguard and an employer,
there should be absolute trust.)

93
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,919
(But you never really)

94
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,240
(opened up to me.)

95
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
(If you don't want to say anything,)

96
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,679
