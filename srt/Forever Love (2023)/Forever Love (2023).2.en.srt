00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:35,623
(Are You Shy Now?)

4
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,592
Proof.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,000
How do I prove it?

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,616
Take it off.

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Miss Lin, you are engaged.

8
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,320
You can't do it to your bodyguard

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,439
when Mr. Chi is not around.

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,840
I give you two choices.

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,879
Either you take it off yourself,
or I'll do it for you.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,680
Continue.

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,120
Are you shy now?

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,039
Your heart is beating fast.
What are you afraid of?

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,080
It's my first time being touched
by a woman. Of course I'm nervous.

16
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,439
What can you say now?

17
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
If you're not that person,

18
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,400
why would there be a scar here?

19
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,240
Not only do I have a scar there,

20
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,759
but I also have one here.

21
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
It's normal

22
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,240
for a bodyguard
to have a few scars, isn't it?

23
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,319
Come on. Touch here.

24
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,520
I didn't expect them
to really make a move.

25
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,759
I was so worried
when I heard you were injured.

26
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,879
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

27
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,360
What if Tong sees you?

28
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,240
She's blind. Can she see me?

29
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Besides, the three of us
have been like this for so many years.

30
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,960
Even if I'm in your room,

31
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,919
she wouldn't think
there's anything wrong.

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
You should go to see Tong.

33
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,120
She was scared today as well.

34
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,080
I'll handle this myself.

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,199
No, let me do it.

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,904
Tong.

37
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
Tong, why are you here?

38
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,319
You are still having a fever.

39
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,839
Yuwei, you're here too.

40
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,160
Yuwei came to bring me medicine.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
You're injured. Is it serious?

42
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,120
It's fine. Just a skin wound.

43
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,920
But you haven't recovered.
You need enough rest.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
Chi Shan, can you

45
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,720
call the police for me?

46
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,680
Call the police?

47
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,879
I told you before

48
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,199
someone broke into my room

49
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,439
on the day my father died.

50
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,160
After I injured him, he escaped.

51
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,519
When I chased him to the third floor,

52
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,959
I saw him choking my father
and telling him to die.

53
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,639
I suspect that person

54
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,920
is the new bodyguard, Zhou Mo.

55
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,000
Although I don't have
definite evidence yet,

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,120
his voice and the feeling he gives me

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,519
are exactly the same as that person's.

58
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,720
And he has that scar.

59
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,720
After Mr. Lin passed away,
we checked the room.

60
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,800
None of the surveillance footage
from the house showed anyone suspicious.

61
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,360
No one went to the study

62
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,199
where Mr. Lin died.

63
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,240
If we call the police,
what should we ask them to investigate?

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,759
Murder.

65
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,879
My father's death
must be related to him.

66
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,920
Tong, I know you're very sad
about Mr. Lin's death,

67
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,480
but the death certificate issued
by the hospital

68
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,480
has confirmed that he died
of a myocardial infarction.

69
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,399
Even if someone did break in,

70
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,079
we don't have the evidence to prove

71
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,839
he's the murderer.

72
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,000
My intuition is always accurate.

73
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,959
My father wouldn't
just pass away like that.

74
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,560
Tong, if you really don't like Zhou Mo,

75
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,000
we can just fire him.

76
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,199
I'll find you a new bodyguard.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,519
No, we can't just let him leave

78
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,879
before I find evidence.

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,319
Tong, don't worry.
I'm always on your side.

80
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,519
But now your eyes are not good.

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,439
- The doctor also said that your fall
- Let go of my father.

82
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,879
(caused bleeding in the brain,
compressing the visual center.)

83
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,720
(What you need to do now is take
your medicine on time and rest well.)

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,600
And most importantly,
keep your mood stable.

85
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
Only then can you recover
as soon as possible.

86
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,040
Yes, Tong. You should get better soon.

87
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,839
Only then can Mr. Lin rest in peace.

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm glad to have you guys.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
(No one went to the study)

90
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,279
(where Mr. Lin died.)

91
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,759

(Qin Group Acquisition Documents)

96
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,072
Who's there?

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,904
It's you.

98
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,080
What are you doing in my father's study
in the middle of the night?

99
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,600
Even if you say nothing,

100
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,960
even if they all say
you're not that person,

101
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,399
but

102
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,240
I know you're the murderer
who killed my father.

103
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,000
If I were,

104
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,639
would you be scared?

105
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,800
