00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,712
(I'm Here For You)

4
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,719
Miss Lin, it's me.

5
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,128
Miss Lin.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,112
Who are you?

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,920
You don't need to know.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,759
I won't let you hurt her.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,320
Nice try. Beat him.

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,319
You're injured.

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,200
Miss Lin, hang in there.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,864
Hang in there.

13
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,159
Lin Xintong, hang in there.

14
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,480
I'm here, and you won't be hurt.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,400
Hello, Chi Shan.

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,528
What?

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,159
Is this how you protect her?

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,319
Why not take her to the hospital?

19
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,280
She doesn't want to.

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,680
Her private doctor will be here soon.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,199
Zhou Mo is hurt.

22
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,560
Chi Shan.

23
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,360
Calm down. I'm scared.

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,360
I asked you to lure Zhou Mo away.

25
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,000
How could you send her away too?

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,800
Fortunately, she's fine. If she died,

27
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,599
our plans would be ruined.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,599
How could I know
that a gang would suddenly rush in?

29
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,439
Besides, without Lin Xintong,

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
could I have easily lured Zhou Mo away?

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,879
I didn't expect Zhou Mo

32
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,159
to fight so hard for her.

33
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,520
We can't let him stay.

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,879
I don't think so.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Lin Xintong insists

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,680
that Zhou Mo killed her father.

37
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
So just let her stick to it.

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,719
As long as she focuses on Zhou Mo,

39
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,919
she won't have the energy
to manage the company.

40
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,719
Then we can carry out

41
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,240
our next plan.

42
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,639
But today there was such a big mess.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
And you provided the address
of Ms. Wang.

44
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm afraid she'll suspect us.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
That's easy.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,120
Those men are debt collectors.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
Just pin it

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,120
on those old men.

49
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,039
No big deal.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,719
I can't make it
without you as my advisor.

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
Of course.

52
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,240
Why are you wearing it? Take it off.

53
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,599
Don't let others find out.

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll wear it.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,919
She's blind. Can she find out?

56
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,520
Besides, she's had you for so long.

57
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,879
Why can't I wear her engagement ring?

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,560
I know I've made you suffer.

59
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,879
You're awake.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,399
From now on, you'll live here.
Inside is my room.

61
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,800
Miss Lin, are you okay?

62
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,439
I was just frightened.

63
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,480
The doctor said your injury is serious.

64
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,519
It's nothing. No big deal.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
I'll be fine in a few days.

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,279
Fortunately, you were there yesterday.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,079
Otherwise, I...

68
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,600
It's my job to protect you.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Anyway, I won't let it happen again.

70
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,519
I know it's your job,

71
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,720
but you were hurt because of me.

72
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,656
Thank you.

73
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,319
You're suddenly being so polite to me.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm not used to it.

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,800
I remember yesterday morning,

76
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,839
you said I killed your father.

77
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,959
I'm very grateful
that you risked your life to save me,

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,079
but this doesn't prove

79
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,639
that you're not the murderer.

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,480
You still don't believe me.

81
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,519
Your wound is deep.
Remember to apply medicine.

82
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,120
(Miss Lin, this is the third time
I'm giving this to you.)

83
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,560
(Please keep it well.)

84
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,879
(Don't lose it again.)

85
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,600
(With the proof of your beloved father)

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
and your most trusted fiance,

87
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,279
you still don't believe me?

Come back with me. Let's go.

114
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,600
I told you not to meddle in my affairs.

115

I have to. Let's get out of here.

116
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,112
Go.

117
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,040
Zhou Mo.

118
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,480
What's wrong?

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,519
Nothing.

120
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,800

00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm fine. It's getting late.

123
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,240

If so, why did you get scalded before?

130
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,679
