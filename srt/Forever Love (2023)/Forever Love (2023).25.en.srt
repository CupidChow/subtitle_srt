He has left?

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,759
That's probably for the best.

44
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,000
Hello?

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,360
Lin Xintong.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why are you so heartless?

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,039
How can you be so cruel?

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
He just got hurt for you.

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,439
How could you
let him be out in the rain?

50
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
Your dad killed his dad.

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,639
Do you want to kill him now?

52
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:00,759
Well,

53
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,639
how is he now?

54
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,520
He passed out
after taking his medicine.

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Qin Moyao.

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,639
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,399
I'll be right over.

58
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,240
You have a fever.

59
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,519
You look awful.

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Actually,

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
you care about me, don't you?

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,639
Of course, I do.

63
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,600
I became heartless,

64
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:00,560
tried to drive you away,

65
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
and refused to be with you.

66
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,000
It's all because I care.

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
I care about you too much,

68
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,560
so I don't want you to suffer anymore.

69
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,839
I know.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,079
I also don't want you
to torment yourself anymore.

71
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,600
I've been thinking these days.

72
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,800
It would be better if I never met you.

73
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,360
You're lying.

74
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,800
Yes.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,319
I'm lying.

76
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,040
You've lied to me so many times.

77
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
Can't I lie to you once?

78
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,439
As long as you don't push me away again,

79
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,279
I'll allow you to lie to me every day.

80
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,160
Then I might be lying to you
with every word I say.

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
Like what?

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,519
For example,

83
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,480
I've always hated you.

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,199
I was not worried
about you at all this morning.

85
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,120
When you're not around,

86
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,920
I've never thought about you.

87
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,839
For example,

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,959
I don't love you.

you're willing to see me?

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,440
Say what you want to say.

125
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,759
I have a video.

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
I want to show you.

127
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,000
(Moyao.)

00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,000

133
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,000

134
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,440

135
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720

136
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,399
Just spit it out.

137
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,480
Didn't you get it?

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,720
Qin Moyao

139
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,960
changed the will

140
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,600
and threatened your dad.

141
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,279
He even transferred my money,
which is 60 million yuan.

142
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,879
So what?

143
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
What?

144
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,960
Don't you think
he's behind your dad's death?

145
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,080
I trust him.

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,759
You trust him?

147
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,240
How long have you known him?

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,159
Do you know

149
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:39,919
he is Qin...

150
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,480
The only heir of the Qin Group,

151
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,519
and the largest shareholder
of Hongfu now.

152
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,799
I have already known all this.

153
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,639
What else do you want to say?

154
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,879
Lin Xintong.

155
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
I didn't expect

156
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,799
you like him so much.

157
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
Then I can't

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
let him live a good life.

159
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,600
What are you trying to do?

160
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm warning you.

161
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,240
If you dare to hurt him,

162
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,159
I will...

163
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:12,879
What?

164
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
You will sue me?

165
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,120
What will you sue me with?

166
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,159
Do you have any evidence?

167
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,960
Don't forget

168
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,679
the court needs evidence.

169
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,360
You transferred 60 million yuan

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,759
to me in accordance with the procedure.

171
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,639
I've consulted a lawyer.

172
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,000
All my procedures are legal.

173
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,720
But the money was stolen by Qin Moyao.

174
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,600
As for your claim
that I murdered your father,

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm sorry

176
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,320
that the evidence

177
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,720
