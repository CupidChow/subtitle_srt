(The One I Deeply Love Is Lying)

00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,960
Mo.

5
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:04,320
Didn't you want to drive me away?

6
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:05,728
Why did you come?

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,719
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,239
You're right.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
I saw what Chi Shan and Yuwei

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,959
have done.

11
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,239
You

12
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,400
can see?

13
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,159
Yes,

14
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,920
I can see.

15
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,480
Xia Yuwei and Chi Shan betrayed me.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,640
I am here to ask you

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,879
if you know anything.

18
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:40,959
Mo,

19
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,079
is the death of my dad related to them?

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,480
Can you tell me?

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,359
Mo, can you tell me?

22
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:47,959
They...

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,000
They...

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,040
Tong, don't come over.

25
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,879
It was you.

26
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:11,400
Yes,

27
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:13,439
it was me.

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
You are really the one
who broke into my house that day.

29
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,560
I didn't tell you

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
I was that man,

31
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,120
because I'm afraid.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,240
I know you always refuse to believe me.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,719
I don't believe you?

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
I've asked you so many times

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,719
if you were that person.

36
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,719
You said you were not

37
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,840
and I believed it.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
But then?

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Your father's death
has nothing to do with me.

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,439
If I killed your dad,

41
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,560
why would I stay by your side?

42
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,759
Why?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,319
For my money.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,639
So,

45
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,560
you still believe
Chi Shan's nonsense, right?

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,039
I don't believe him.

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,919
If I believed him,

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I wouldn't have felt

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
that you had a hard time when I heard

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,520
you wanted to cooperate with him.

51
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,840
But now it seems

52
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,280
I was wrong to trust you.

53
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,199
So,

54
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,120
that's who you think I am.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,439
For money, I can do anything, right?

56
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,360
Of course.

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,960
Didn't you tell me?

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
You said your family went bankrupt.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,479
A bunch of people
forced you to pay them back.

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,800
For money,

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,199
you should be able to do anything.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,199
If you need money, you can come to me.

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,400
You can try to see
how much you're worth to me.

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
So,

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,080
this is who you think I am?

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,280
If you really were upright,

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
you should have admitted from the start

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,080
instead of evading and hiding the truth.

69
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,599
I admit it.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,400
That day I went to the Lin family

71
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,520
because Chi Shan
hired me to swap the will.

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,919
I didn't kill anyone.

I can swear on my life.

78
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,399
Lin Xintong,

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,279
this matter is too complicated.

80
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't want to involve you.

81
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
After all this time together,

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,959
don't you really have feelings?

84
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,720
I don't have feelings.

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,720
I always wanted to find
the person who killed my dad,

86
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,639
but he has always been by my side.

Didn't you want me to prove myself?

91
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,879
Does this feel the same as that day?

92
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,199
Lin Xintong,

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,720
think carefully about

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,399
the things I've been telling you.

95
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,560
If you really think I'm the killer,

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,079
you can call the police now.

97
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,279
I once trusted you,

98
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,759
but you disappointed me so much.

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,519
Enough.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Stop drinking.

101
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,560
Didn't you know

102
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,000
that the day would come?

103
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,240
I knew.

104
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,199
I just didn't expect
it would come so soon.

105
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,120
I originally thought,

106
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
once I found new evidence

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,279
and eliminated Chi Shan's threat,

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,000
I would tell her everything.

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,040
But it is just fate.

110
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,279
Maybe this is for the best.

111
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,759
There is always
a deep hatred between you two.

112
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,720
It is impossible for you to be together.

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,360
You can now withdraw

114
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,800
and free yourself.

115
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,920
No matter how she sees me,

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,839
I will definitely side with her.

117
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,399
Now she can see.

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
Her threat to Chi Shan is even greater.

119
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,639
She is in more danger.

120
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,920
Qin Moyao,

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,079
can you wake up?

122
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,439
She now knows

123
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,879
you were the one
who went to her house back then.

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,560
She saw you and her father
had a conflict.

125
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,720
She is convinced that you are the one
who killed her father.

126
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,519
No matter what you do now,
it's meaningless.

127
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,759
Do you understand?

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,879
Miss.

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,600
What's wrong?

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
The lawyer, Mr. Wang is here.

131
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,920
Mr. Chi is waiting for you.

132
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,879
Okay.

133
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Help me change clothes.

134
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,839
Okay.

135
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,759
(That day I went to the Lin family)

136
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,399
(because Chi Shan
hired me to swap the will.)

137
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,600
(Testing will tell me)

138
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,712
(if it's true.)

139
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,759
Mr. Wang,

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,959
we can start now.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,839
Miss Lin,

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,319
please confirm it again.

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,279
According to Mr. Lin's will,

144
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,560
he had about 60 million yuan in savings,

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,519
and five properties,

146
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,800
as well as some antiques and cars.

147
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,639
All will be yours.

148
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,519
Wait.

149
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,160
What did you say?

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,639
It is impossible.

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,800
The will is incorrect.

152
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,040
It's correct.

153
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,759
This is Mr. Lin's final will.

154
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,560
Chi Shan,

155
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,200
why do you say the will is wrong?

156
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,399
What I mean is,

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,399
as Uncle Lin was
the biggest shareholder of Hongfu,

158
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,559
how could there be no Hongfu shares?

159
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,480
Mr. Wang,

160
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
have you confirmed the details clearly?

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,840
Yes.

162
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,519
This is indeed the will
that Mr. Lin set up

163
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,600
two days before his death.

164
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,279
It has always been with me.

165
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,519
We have verified the asset details.

166
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,799
The newly established will?

167
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,759
Could there be a mistake?

168
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,480
Tong,

169
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
confirm again.

170
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,320
This will...

171
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,120
Chi Shan,

172
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,440
why do you care so much about

173
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,120
how many shares my dad had?

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

175
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,600
I...

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm worried about you.

177
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,279
Think about it,

178
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,679
you and me together

179
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,039
have less than 30% of the shares.

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,080
If the remaining shares
are in the hands of one person,

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,879
doesn't it mean
Hongfu Group is someone else's?

182
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,279
This is the asset
your father worked so hard to make.

183
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,879
How can we let others take it?

184
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,279
Chi Shan,

185
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
Mr. Wang has confirmed,

186
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,919
so there is no problem.

187
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:39,200
You should let Tong
process the paperwork.

188
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,039
(So Qin Moyao's saying that Chi Shan
hired him to change the will)

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
(is true.)

190
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
