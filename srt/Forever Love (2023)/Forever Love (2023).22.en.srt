What We Didn't Finish Last Night)

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,679
I told myself

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,320
if one day you like me,

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,520
I don't want it to be for this reason.

7
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,840
I hope you really like me.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,640
I do genuinely like you.

9
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,200
It's not because you saved me.

10
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,200
Xintong.

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,200
Qin Moyao.

12
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm confessing to you.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,640
How come you have no reaction at all?

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,359
Didn't you say you like me too?

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,480
Xintong,

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,000
I have no past

17
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,959
nor a future.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't care.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
But

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,439
if I'm not what you expect,

21
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,519
would you regret it?

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,239
Yes.

23
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,079
I'm regretting it now.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,799
I regret that I didn't discover sooner

25
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,120
that I like you too.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,040
I regret that I kept doubting you
and misunderstood you.

27
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,760
Qin Moyao,

28
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,719
from today on, I only trust you.

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,280
No matter what you say,
I'll believe you.

30
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,280
You haven't given me
a birthday gift yet.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,319
Qin Moyao,

32
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,759
if you genuinely like me,

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,520
why not try being with me?

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Qin Moyao.

35
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,680
Qin Moyao,

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,039
are you alright?

37
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,520
You're awake.

38
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,960
How did you get hurt?

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,240
I was drunk last night
and didn't see it clearly.

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,719
Then if you were drunk,

41
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,199
do your words from last night count?

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I'll make you coffee.

43
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,240
Regret it?

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
I never regret

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,879
what I said.

46
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,800
Alright.

47
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,159
Then let's continue

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,080

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,560
last night.

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,279
I'll make you coffee.

51
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Qin Moyao,

52
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,600
we're out of coffee beans.

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,279
You may get some
in the living room cabinet.

54
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,360
Did you find them?

55
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,064
(Lin Xintong Information)

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,639
Did you find them?

57
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,984
(Share Transfer Agreement)

58
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,800
You didn't find them?

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,480
These are all fake, aren't they?

60
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,680
You studied my preferences,

61
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,680
and studied how to gain my trust.

62
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,920
You got 51 percent

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,600
of the shares of Hongfu.

64
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,399
These are lies you made up
to deceive Chi Shan, right?

65
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,439
Qin Moyao,

66
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,079
say something.

67
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,519
It's fake.

68
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
It's true.

69
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
You're lying.

70
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,279
I didn't lie to you.

71
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,959
I came to your house
with a purpose at the beginning.

72
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,040
I studied your preferences,

73
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,399
analyzed your personality,

74
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,319
and gained your trust.

75
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,680
Stop it.

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,759
I also got the key

77
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,319
and opened your cabinet
for keeping photos.

78
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,720
I found a lot of clues

79
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,680
and got what I wanted.

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
Stop it.

81
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,319
Xintong,

82
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,399
but I didn't do these

83
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,040
to get the shares of your group.

84
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,399
Then what is it for?

85
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,279
Why did you have these shares?

86
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Tell me.

87
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,160
