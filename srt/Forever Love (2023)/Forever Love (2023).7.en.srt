Yuwei.

5
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,799
I'm here.

6
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,079
Can you help me find out
what's in this USB drive?

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,280
Sure.

(Personal Information of the Bodyguard)

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,640
(Qin Moyao?)

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,439
(Why does this name sound so familiar?)

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,319
Yuwei.

12
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,239
So,

13
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,439
what's in it?

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,719
The personal information of a bodyguard.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,719
This person's name is Qin Moyao.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
It includes his height and weight.

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,239
He used to study cardiology

18
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,719
and cardiac surgery.

19
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,439
There is a copy
of his medical examination report.

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,879
It shows that he once had a surgery.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,359
There's a scar
on his lower left abdomen.

22
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,879
Qin Moyao?

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,024
Is there a photo of him?

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,920
No.

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,920
(He said Zhou Mo is not the "Zhou Mo".)

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Miss Lin.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Why did you come out by yourself?

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,280
I couldn't find my bodyguard.

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
Even nobody could get me water.

30
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,319
So I had to find water myself.

31
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,439
It's so late.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
Where did you go?

33
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,560
I couldn't sleep,

34
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,879
so I went for a walk.

35
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,400
Can you drink?

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't usually drink.

37
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,719
Open the cabinet on your left.

38
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,879
Why?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,879
Drink with me.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,280
Why should I listen to you?

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,919
I'm a bodyguard,

42
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,639
not a drinking buddy.

43
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,439
We are both fatherless now.

44
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,960
So today,

45
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,759
just for once.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Okay?

47
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
You can't pretend to drink
because I'm blind.

48
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,439
You have to drink it up.

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,599
Keep going.

50
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,680
Pour it up.

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,800
Cheers.

52
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,639

on his lower left abdomen.)

Miss Lin.

65
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,160
I'm drunk.

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,160
It's risky for you to do this.

67
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,439
Let go of me.

68
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,439
You climbed on me yourself.

69
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,920
Why should I let go of you?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
If you dare touch me,

71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
I will make you end up in jail.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,079
You got me drunk

73
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,879
and took off my shirt.

74
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,600
Why are you blaming me?

75
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
That was not what I meant.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,920
Then what did you mean?

77
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,199
I...

78
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,399
I just wanted to confirm one thing.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
Confirm what?

80
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,560
Do you have to get me drunk
and strip my shirt?

81
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,519
You're not Zhou Mo.

82
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,879
You're Qin Moyao,

83
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,639
aren't you?

84
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,279
You investigated me.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
I didn't.

86
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,199
Someone handed me your information.

87
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,319
It said that you're not Zhou Mo.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,199
You're Qin Moyao.

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,319
You once had a surgery.

90
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,160
There's a scar
on your lower left abdomen.

91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
And then?

92
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,319
Are you Qin Moyao or not?

93
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,759
Yes.

94
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,279
You admit it.

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
So, it's true that you killed my dad.

96
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,839
What does your dad's death

97
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,879
have to do with
whether I am Qin Moyao or not?

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,680
If you didn't kill my dad,

99
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,319
why would you be my bodyguard
with a fake identity?

100
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,879
Lin Xintong, I swear.

101
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,759
I have nothing to do

102
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,800
with the death of Lin Guofu.

103
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,000
As for why I use the name Zhou Mo,

104
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,319
that's my personal business.

105
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,720
I don't have to explain it to you.

106
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,759
At least so far,

107
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,279
I haven't done anything to harm you.

108
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
You can fire me right now if you want.

109
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,160
But you'd better think it over.

110
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,399
Can you really

111
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,639
trust the people around you?

112
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,639
What's wrong with them?

113
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,480
Tell me.

114
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,120
Why did you expose me?

115
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,360
What are you trying to do?

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,079
Yes,

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
I did it.

118
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,120
Staying by her side,

119
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
you're bound to be exposed one day.

120
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,160
You got hurt for her.

121
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,040
What's next?

122
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,199
Die for her?

123
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,440
Are you trying to gain her trust?

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
Or do you have other ideas?

125
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,399
Whatever I want to do,

126
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,440
it's none of your business.

127
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,879
Qin Moyao.

128
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Do you think I want to interfere?

129
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,159
Your father raised me as his own son.

130
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,679
I can't let him down.

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
He entrusted you to me
before he passed away.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,120
He asked me
to prevent you from seeking revenge.

133
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,519
But over the years,

134
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,600
you've been seeking justice for him.

135
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,440
You even gave up further study
in medicine.

136
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,919
And you got injured
multiple times for this.

137
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,559
I can't go against your father's wishes.

138
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,240
Zhou Mo.

139
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,600
If you see me as a brother,

140
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,039
don't stop me.

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,639
I'm about to find out something.

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,639
I can't give up now.

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,879
I found a string of numbers
in Lin's house.

144
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,120
Check it out for me.

145
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,840
Xiaozhu, call...

146
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Ms. Liu.

147
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes?

148
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,480
What can I do for you?

149
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,720
Is he back yet?

150
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,360
Not yet.

151
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,159
Miss Lin, you're
in such a hurry to find me.

152
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,600
Is there an emergency?

153
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Just asking.

154
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,080
Aren't you curious
about the people around you?

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
I'll take you to a place.

156
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,519
Do you dare to come with me?

157
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,399
I have nothing to be afraid of.

158
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,799
Help me up.

159
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,519
Ms. Wang.

160
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,360
Tell her everything you know.

161
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,159
That day when I went up
to the second floor,

162
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,799
you had already fainted.

163
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,519
Mr. Lin asked me to call the ambulance.

164
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,360
It was chaotic.

165
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,000
There were quite a few people around.

166
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,840
I didn't look closely.

167
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,919
Then, Mr. Chi arrived.

168
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,039
We sent you to the hospital together.

169
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,639
How did my dad die?

170
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm not quite sure.

171
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
Not long after you were sent
to the hospital,

172
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,000
Mr. Lin hurried back,

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,720
saying he had to talk to Mr. Chi.

174
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,200
They went to the study.

175
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,480
I brought them tea.

176
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,960
But not long after I left,

177
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,799
I heard Mr. Chi calling for help.

178
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,360
When I got to the study,

179
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,879
Mr. Chi and Miss Xia

180
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,759
were giving Mr. Lin first aid.

181
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,639
I called 120 right away,

182
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,440
but it was already too late.

183
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
You mean

184
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,519
when my dad died,

185
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,840
Chi Shan and Yuwei were in his study?

186
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,679
Yes.
