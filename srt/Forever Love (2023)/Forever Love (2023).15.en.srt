00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,873
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,360
(The One I Tormented is Scum,
The One I Hit is You)

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
You didn't tell me last time

5
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,840
if my father's death

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,119
is related to him.

7
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,759
Most likely.

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,880
Or it wouldn't be such a coincidence.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,960
He changed the will,

10
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,600
and Mr. Lin passed away soon.

11
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,960
He was even in a hurry to bury Mr. Lin.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,880
But since your father has been buried,

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,359
it's not easy to
find evidence of his murder.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,159
I will find the evidence.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,439
I don't believe someone can murder

16
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,799
without leaving any evidence.

17
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,000
Mo,

18
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,920
you can't tell anyone

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,280
that I can see.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,359
In front of them,
I am still the blind girl.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,879
Did you really convince her
to fire Qin Moyao?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,799
Of course.

23
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,519
I worked so hard

24
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,159
to make her suspicious of Qin Moyao.

25
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,200
Naturally, I had to strike
while the iron was hot.

26
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,959
She has agreed to me

27
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,560
to terminate his bodyguard contract.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,599
But with him gone,

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
you're not playing
your cat-and-mouse game

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,959
anymore?

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,319
The most urgent thing now

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,040
is to find out
Hongfu's biggest shareholder.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,479
You...

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,039
Why are you still here?

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,599
Tong,

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
didn't you terminate
the contract with him?

37
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,319
Yes,

38
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,599
I have terminated
the contract with Zhou Mo.

39
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,639
Then he is...

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,120
This is my new personal assistant,

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,639
Qin Moyao.

42
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,639
Mr. Chi.

43
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,120
Do you know what you're doing?

44
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,479
We finally got rid of him.

45
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,800
Why did you invite him back?

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,039
Didn't you say before
that he planned to harm me?

47
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,159
How can we let him go easily?

48
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,800
Before, he was just my bodyguard.

49
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,080
It was hard for him
to have too much room to play

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
to cheat me out of my money.

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,879
Now he is my assistant,

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,599
he should expose himself quickly, right?

53
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,000
Tong,

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,599
don't be so naive, okay?

55
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,159
He is not so easy to deal with.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Isn't there you and Yuwei to help me?

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,319
You won't deceive me,

58
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,479
right?

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,680
Tong, Chi Shan and I
are just worried about you.

60
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,560
We're afraid
you will be in danger again.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Before, he even

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,639
came here under the identity of Zhou Mo,

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,639
and teamed up with his brother
to deal with you.

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,439
We are really worried about your safety.

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,039
Yuwei,

66
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
you are so afraid of Qin Moyao.

67
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,639
Is there something
you're hiding from me?

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,039
Something I don't know?

69
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,080
How could that be?

70
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,240
Why would you think that?

71
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,240
Chi Shan,

72
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,960
don't worry.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,560
I won't let anyone take advantage.

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,120
I will guard the Lin family.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,439
As for Qin Moyao,

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,319
just leave him to me.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,439
Oh, right,

78
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,680
my birthday is in a couple of days.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,879
You didn't forget, did you?

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Of course not.

81
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
That's good.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
For this birthday,

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,759
I want to invite a few friends
to celebrate together.

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm still waiting
for your birthday gifts.

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,439
Okay.

86
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,279
(If they could turn against each other,)

87
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,279
(maybe I could get the information)

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,519
(about Chi Shan's crime from Xia Yuwei.)

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,199
Tong, you look so beautiful today.

90
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,879
You look so pretty.

91
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,160
Happy birthday.

♪Happy birthday to you♪

93

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,759
happy birthday.

97
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
Tong,

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
make a wish.

99
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:30,020
♪The one I deeply love is lying♪

♪I can only measure with intuition♪

103
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
What wish did you make?

104
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,519
If I say it out loud,

105
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,360
it won't come true.

106
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Tong,

107
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,519
this is the gift Chi Shan and I
prepared for you.

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,680
Hurry and open it to see if you like it.

109
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720
Speaking of gifts,

110
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,560
the best one is

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,160
the engagement ring
Chi Shan plans to give me.

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
I remember how beautiful
that natural diamond is.

113
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm so envious.

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,439
But no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't find it later.

115
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,879
Yuwei,

116
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,360
have you seen it?

117
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,079
Look, that one.

118
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,240
That one on Yuwei's finger.

119
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,959
Why does it look like
the one Tong described?

120
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,560
Exactly.

121
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,079
I...

122
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I...

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,160
I remember.

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
There seemed to be
a square diamond on it.

125
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,759
Yuwei,

126
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,199
is it the same one
you're wearing on your finger?

127
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,759
It seems to be.

128
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,000
It looks like it.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,199
Just like the one Tong described.

130
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,279
Is it this one?

131
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,079
Yuwei.

132
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
Mr. Chi, check it out.

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,879
Is what they're saying true?

134
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,720
Mr. Chi,

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,079
you have to help Tong take a look.

136
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,319
Is it that engagement ring?

137
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,199
Yuwei.

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,160
Yeah.

139
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,720
Could it be that she stole Tong's?

140
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,319
Could it be?

141
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,360
Who knows?

142
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,879
Look at her reaction.

143
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,720
She looks guilty.

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
She must've stolen it.

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,839
It must be.

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,399
She went too far.

147
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
How could she do this?

148
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,600
How could Yuwei do this?

149
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,720
Right.

150
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,399
If it's true, Yuwei is really shameless.

151
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,639
Tong, is it yours?

152
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,600
Is it?

153
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,759
Yes, it's mine.

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
It really is.

155
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,519
Yuwei,

156
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,000
it is your fault.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Right.

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,040
We all know how nice Tong is to you.

159
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,240
How could you even steal her ring?

160
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,720
Right, Yuwei.

161
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,079
It is an engagement ring.

162
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,360
You are so close to her.

163
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,319
You can't possibly not know.

164
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,439
How could you
even steal the wedding ring?

165
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,120
Exactly.

166
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,439
You've been besties
for over twenty years.

167
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,040
You went too far.

168
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,800
How could you do this?

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,720
No.

170
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,399
Tong,

171
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,279
it was you who asked me

172
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,720
to keep the ring for you.

173
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,279
I didn't steal it.

174
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,279
You didn't steal it?

175
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,040
It was on your finger.

176
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,879
You didn't steal it?

177
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,160
Right. Stop arguing.

178
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
So stubborn.

179
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,800
Did I ask you to keep it?

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,399
Even if I did,

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
you should keep it safe

182
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,519
instead of wearing it yourself.

183
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,120
Yuwei,

184
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,199
all these years,

185
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,759
I never refused to give you

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
anything of mine that you liked.

187
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,399
You liked my room,

188
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,639
so I gave it to you.

189
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,040
For whichever piece of jewelry,

190
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,319
and piece of clothing,

191
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,680
didn't I give them to you
without a second thought?

192
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
You're really shameless.

193
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,639
How could you do this?

194
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,559
This is my engagement ring.

195
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,480
You were wearing it on your finger.

196
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,879
Are you telling me
you even want my fiancé?

197
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,799
Tong,

198
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,120
don't overthink.

199
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,919
There is no such thing.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,840
Yuwei,

201
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,159
speak up.

202
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,360
What else are you unsatisfied with me?

203
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,360
What else do you want?

204
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,919
Tell me.

205
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,320
Yuwei.

206
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,399
I didn't expect you to be so ambitious.

207
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,600
She is meant to be.

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,799
A child of a servant

209
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,960
indeed has such a narrow vision.

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,919
Exactly.

211
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,320
Even if raised as a sister,
she won't be close to you.

212
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,919
She can't resist
when she sees nice things.

213
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,480
Right.

214
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,639
Don't keep her in your house anymore.

215
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,360
- Tong.
- Right.

216
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
Kick her out.

217
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Why keep her?

218
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,200
Kick her out.

219
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,759
She's a thief.

220
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,679
Why are you still here?

221
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,840
You should leave.

222
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,279
Out.

223
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,879
Get out.

224
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,559
Leave on your own.

225
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,120
Get out.

226
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,519
Get out.

227
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,440
Go away.

228
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,960
Leave now.

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,720
- Go quickly.
- Go quickly.

230
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,720
No one welcomes you.

231
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,559
Oh, my.

232
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,799
Tong's kindness for her

233
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
is all wasted.

234
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,559
Leave.

235
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,440
Hurry up and leave.

236
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,559
Leave, Xia Yuwei.

237
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,320
Why are you still here?

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
You're not welcomed here.

239
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,919
They treated you well.

240
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,080
Exactly, a real ingrate.

241
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,840
Get lost.

242
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,480
Go.

243
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,279
