00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:30,366
=Forever Love=

2
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:33,105
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:35,955
(Come to Help Me)

4
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,280
No need to be so polite with me.

5
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,000
Come on, have some porridge.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,200
Miss Lin, the porridge is a bit hot.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,119
Be careful.

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm so sorry, Tong.

9
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,840
I almost scalded you just now.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,799
It's okay. I was careless.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,599
(Zhou Mo is placed
around Lin Xintong by Lin Guofu.)

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,400
(He will ruin our plan sooner or later.)

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,159
(We have to get rid of him
as soon as possible.)

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
(You figure out a way to lure him out.)

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,760
(The rest is up to me.)

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,359
Oh, right, Tong.
I ran into Ms. Wang yesterday.

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,232
Ms. Wang?

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,000
There's something
I never really understood.

19
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,760
She worked for your family
for so many years.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,879
Why did she quit so decisively?

21
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,159
I wanted to ask her why
for you yesterday,

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,560
but she seemed in a hurry.

23
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,439
We didn't chat for a few minutes
before she left.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,319
Ms. Wang worked
for my father for a really long time.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Maybe she knows
something about his death.

26
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,280
Tong, what are you talking about?

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,599
Yuwei, do you know
where Ms. Wang is now?

28
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,519
I did ask for the address.

29
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,680
Good, then I'll go visit her.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,159
Zhou Mo, do you dare to go with me?

31
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,760
I am your bodyguard.

32
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,920
I will follow you wherever you go.

33
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,520
Good, then let's go now.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,639
Yuwei, send the address to his phone.

35
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,599
Help me.

36
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,120
Be careful on the way.

37
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,719
I can do it myself.

38
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm just temporarily blind,
not disabled.

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,439
What are you doing now?

40
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,199
Fastening the seatbelt.

41
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,280
Miss Lin, don't be nervous.
I have no interest in you.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,319
I noticed you didn't have breakfast.

43
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,840
There's hot milk in the cup.

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,479
If you're hungry, have a sip.

45
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,879
Mind your own business.

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,719
I don't want to care about you,
but your father paid a lot of money.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm just doing my job.

48
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,312
Drive.

49
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
How much longer?

50
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,800
Just one more intersection.

51
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,519
Stop the car ahead. We'll walk there.

52
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,319
Actually, it is now

53
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,680
a great opportunity for you.

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,199
What do you mean?

55
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,000
You could push me now

56
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,959
or leave me in the middle of the road

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
to get hit by a car.

58
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,639
Then no one would suspect you.

59
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,279
So you let me
stop the car there just to test me?

60
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,600
We'll be at Ms. Wang's place soon.

61
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,759
You don't have much opportunity left.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Since you suspect me,
how can you be sure

63
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,480
that I'm taking you to see Ms. Wang?

64
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,240
Not bad, you're not stupid.
You know to gather evidence.

65
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Miss Lin, if I wanted to kill you,

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
I'd have countless opportunities,

67
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
not to mention that you're blind.

68
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,920
But harming others for personal gain
is not my principle.

69
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,240
Lin Xintong, you've
always been high above.

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,560
Now everything you had is mine.

71
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,839
We've arrived.

72
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,480
Wait, something's not right.

73
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,360
What? You're about to be exposed,
feeling guilty?

74
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,720
Why don't you just
tell me the truth now?

75
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,639
Are you an idiot?

76
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Would I bring you here if I was scared?

77
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,519
I'll go in and check.
You stay here and don't move.

78
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,639
Take this. Press it if there's danger.

79
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
I'll be out in a moment.

80
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,832
Xiaozhu, call...

81
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,679
Who are you? What do you want?

82
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,559
Miss, we've been waiting
at your door for several days.

83
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,240
Today you finally fell into our hands.

84
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you think we'll let you go easily?

85
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,759
What do you want?

86
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,159
Since your fiancé won't pay back

87
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,200
the debts your group owes,

88
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,879
I can only come to you,
the heiress to the group.

89
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,159
How much does he owe you?
Name your price.

90
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll have them give it to you.

91
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,080
Xiaozhu.

92
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,120
You think we're idiots

93
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,399
and that we'll let you tip them off?

94
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
What do you really want?

95
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,720
What do you think we're gonna do?

96
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,384
Let me go!

97
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
Who sent you here?

98
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay! I really don't know who it is.

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,799
Our task was just to wait here.

100
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,960
If you came in,

101
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,559
we couldn't let you walk out.

102
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,584
Let me go!

103
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,519
Trying to run? Stay still.

104
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,000
Help!

105
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,320
You blind woman, stay down.

106
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:34,840
Don't touch me!

107
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,960
Miss Lin, it's me.

108
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,992
