00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:32,576
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:35,424
(I'm Interested in Your Fiancee)

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,359
Miss Lin,

5
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,280
this is Zhou Mo.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,000
So you're Zhou Mo?

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,119
Yes,

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,520
I am Zhou Mo.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,200
Let me feel what you look like.

10
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,519
Mind your manners.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,760
Why do you have to
touch every man you meet?

12
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, I need to know what he looks like.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,879
What if I mix you two up one day?

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,480
You won't.

15
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,519
You might never see him again.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,640
Why?

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
By the way,

18
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,840
I think my dad signed
the contract with Zhou Mo.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Why don't you two switch back
while you have the chance?

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,719
You're both called Mo after all.

21
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,920
It doesn't matter who you are.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Is it really the same?

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,439
I just said it casually,

24
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,599
but you're really getting into it.

25
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,840
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,719
You're always giving your employer
the cold shoulder.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,159
Who are you trying to investigate?

28
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,799
Xia Yuwei.

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,599
My bestie.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,760
But I don't know how to investigate her.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,840
I just want to know

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,080
after my dad's death,

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
whether there were any issues

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
with this person's
financial transactions?

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,919
Money

36
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,680
is the only reason I can think of
why she might deceive me.

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,360
Okay.

38
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,719
The information.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
Here's her information.

40
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,520
Can I trust you?

41
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,719
I'm his best friend. What do you think?

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,479
The number you have dialed
is powered off.

43
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,840
The number you have dialed
is powered off.

44
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,919
Tong, where have you been?

45
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,639
Chi Shan?

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Why didn't you answer my calls?

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
I went out with Mo for a bit.

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,680
I didn't bring my phone.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
Have you been drinking?

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,080
I had a little at dinner.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,719
Why didn't you tell me
you were going out?

52
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,000
Chi Shan,

53
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,439
you're hurting me.

54
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,439
Didn't you hear her say it hurts?

55
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,759
Go out.

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
I need to talk to Tong.

57
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
I'll be right outside the door.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
How long have you known him?

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
You're comfortable going out with him
late at night?

60
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,360
Have you considered my feelings?

61
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,280
Chi Shan,

62
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,240
he is my bodyguard.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
He is responsible for protecting me.

64
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,039
I trust him.

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not allowed to go out
with him casually in the future.

66
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,639
I'm doing this for your own good.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm not a bird in a cage.

68
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,120
I have the freedom to choose
who I go out with.

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,800
You've never spoken to me
like this before.

70
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,319
You've never

71
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,920
treated me with such an attitude.

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
I'm sorry, Tong.

73
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,560
I'm just overly worried about you.

74
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,800
Understood.

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,839
I'll tell you where I'm going
in the future, okay?

76
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm tired.

78
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,879
I'll go rest now.

79
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,279
Come out with me.

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,639
Tell me,

81
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,759
what do you really want?

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,839
Mr. Chi,

83
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,199
I'm just a bodyguard.

84
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,759
What could I possibly want?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,959
A bodyguard?

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,879
A high achiever from medical school
is a bodyguard?

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Mr. Chi, you've investigated me.

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
Why are you asking me?

89
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,000
Our purpose is the same.

90
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,959
Lin Guofu is dead.

91
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,560
Lin Xintong is blind.

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,040
We're just trying to take this chance

93
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,519
to make some money, aren't we?

94
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,839
Is it really that simple?

95
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,600
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

96
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,120
You had me switch the will

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,439
before Lin Guofu died.

98
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,720
Weren't you afraid of being found out?

99
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,639
But luckily,

100
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,240
he died just in time.

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,759
What do you mean by that?

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Chi,

103
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
I know what you want.

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,439
You also know who I am.

105
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,000
Why don't we collaborate?

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,319
I'm not greedy.

107
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,360
Of the money you get,

108
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,439
give me ten percent.

109
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,480
How about it?

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
The young master of Qin Group.

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,199
Is ten percent enough

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,519
for you?

113
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm no longer a young master.

114
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,639
I don't have high expectation.

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,959
Ten percent

116
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
is a lot.

117
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,680
Mr. Chi, you can take your time
to consider.

118
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,000
But

119
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,759
I have one condition.

120
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,759
What we want is money.

121
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,560
You're not allowed to harm her.

122
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,712
I'd like to remind
Miss Xia in particular.

123
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,319
You're interested in my fiancee?

124
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,879
You're not interested in her,

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,519
but I am.

126
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,120
Is there a problem?

127
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,879
What if I insist on dealing with her?

128
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,120
It's best not to.

129
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
I have a bad temper.

130
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,360
I don't know what I might do.

131
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,839
What does that mean?

132
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
This is a stock holding agreement.

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,240
Mr. Lin has always been regretting
the merger with the Qin Group.

134
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,079
Upon learning of Mr. Qin's death,

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
he decided to transfer

136
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,519
his fifty-one percent of shares to you.

137
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,519
I thought you would defiantly refuse me.

138
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,040
Why should I refuse you?

139
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,560
What he owes our Qin family

140
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,120
is far more than this.

141
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,759
However,

142
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,919
now that he had decided
to give the shares to me,

143
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,960
why did he bother with great pains

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,320
to merge with our Qin Group
in the first place?

145
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,919
Could there be another reason
for the merger with the Qin Group?

146
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm just a private legal advisor

147
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,759
hired by Mr. Lin.

148
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,600
My task

149
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,759
is to have you sign
this stock holding agreement.

150
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,960
I've helped you retrieve

151
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
all the things you wanted.

152
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,960
Inside, there are documents of Hongfu
joining hands with a third-party company

153
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
in shorting the Qin Group

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,919
and purchasing it at a low price.

155
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,480
Now all these evidences
are in our hands.

156
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,840
You did all this alone.

157
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,200
Isn't it for this?

158
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,840
Why aren't you happy when you got it?

159
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,559
Alright,

160
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,919
this issue is finally coming to an end.

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Let's have a drink.

162
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

163
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
How did this

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
just end like this?

165
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,879
Of course, it's not over.

166
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,879
I'll accompany you
to see a lawyer tomorrow.

167
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
What will happen to Hongfu?

168
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Hongfu will certainly
be left with nothing.

169
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,080
We can sue the Hongfu Group

170
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,799
for suspected illegal transactions.

171
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,039
Or if worst comes to worst,

172
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,639
we can expose everything

173
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,759
and ruin their reputation.

174
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,480
An eye for an eye.

175
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,399
Isn't this what you wanted to see?

176
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,679
You want them to taste

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,720
the pain your family experienced
back then.

178
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,720
I can't do that.

179
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,200
She wouldn't be able to handle it.

180
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,279
The one who was wrong was Lin Guofu.

181
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,080
He is already dead now.

182
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,519
We need to think this through.

183
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,279
Qin Moyao,

184
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
wake up.

185
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,639
You've given up so much over the years.

186
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,256
You're just one step

187
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:17,536
away from liberation.

188
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,328
Are you going to watch everything
that should belong to you

189
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,352
fall into someone else's hands?

190
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,480
Even so,

191
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
I still can't do that.

192
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,960
Qin Moyao,

193
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,799
you don't want to take action
against Hongfu.

194
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,080
Is it for Lin Xintong?

195
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,039
Have you forgotten
how your father died,

196
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
why your mother is bedridden,

197
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,679
and what you've been through?

198
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,440
Are you going to give up half-way?

199
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,519
I haven't forgotten that.

200
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,759
It's just that there's something strange
about this.

201
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,120
If Lin Guofu really wanted

202
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,759
to make a fortune
by merging with the Qin Group,

203
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,759
he wouldn't have given me
all his shares before his death.

204
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,519
Qin Moyao,

205
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,279
have you gone mad?

206
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,480
Or has that woman drugged you?

207
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm going back.

208
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,879
What are you going back for?

209
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,279
You went to Lin's house
to find evidence.

210
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,679
Now that you've found the evidence,

211
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,440
what reason do you have
to be a bodyguard for the Lin family?

212
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,159
Because

213
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,840
I want to investigate the truth.

214
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,519
I want to understand
what exactly is going on.

215
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,399
