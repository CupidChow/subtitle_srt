(Insurance Contract)

00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:18,944
(Insured: Lin Xintong,
Insured Amount: 60 million)

6
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,840
Find me some reliable stocks
as soon as possible.

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,680
I need to spend her
60 million yuan quickly.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,000
If such a large amount of money

9
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,280
has suddenly gone,

10
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,920
what do you plan to tell her?

11
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,200
What do I need to say?

12
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,120
Investment failure is normal.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,799
Do you think she's a fool?

14
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,159
Will she believe that?

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
She has to believe it
even if she doesn't.

16
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,400
Taking advantage of
her current blindness,

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
at least we should get the money

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,359
and the properties she owns.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
What's wrong?

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,319
Someone has been here.

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
When I went out,

22
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,759
the files were clearly in this position.

23
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,120
Could it be that you remembered wrong?

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,479
Impossible.

25
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,319
I did it on purpose.

26
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,759
The files have always been
in a fixed position.

27
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,039
I was only out for a few minutes.

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,439
Acted so quickly?

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you think

30
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,199
the person could still be in the room?

31
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,000
Mr. Chi,

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,960
you were looking for me?

33
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,400
When did you come in?

34
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,759
You don't even know when I came in,

35
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,199
yet you want to

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,159
transfer Lin Xintong's money?

37
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,159
Are you being a bit naive?

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
The people from yesterday
were hired by you, right?

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,879
We agreed to cooperate,

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,199
but you stabbed me in the back.

41
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,240
This is not the attitude
for cooperation.

42
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,719
What about you?

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you dare to say the incident
at Tong's birthday party

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,879
wasn't instigated by you?

45
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
Miss Xia,

46
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,680
I remember you reconciled with Miss Lin.

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,840
You've sided with Mr. Chi so soon.

48
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,919
You are really loyal.

49
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,719
You...

50
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,960
I planned to discuss
a big deal with Mr. Chi.

51
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,759
But since there's no trust between us,

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,439
there's no need to talk.

53
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,639
What big deal?

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,439
You want to hear it?

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Let's talk downstairs.

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,959
Let's talk here.

57
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,160
Why do we need to talk downstairs?

58
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,040
I don't feel safe here.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
What if I get recorded again?

60
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,120
What do you want to say?

61
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,279
Just say it.

62
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,959
If I can help you transfer the money,

63
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,879
how much are you willing
to split with me?

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
You have a way?

65
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,079
This is a friend of mine
from the underworld.

66
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,759
He can help you solve all problems,

67
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,639
and there won't be any legal risks.

68
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,279
Do you think I will trust you again?

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,079
Mr. Chi,

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,319
I don't understand
why you are always targeting me.

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,079
Is it because
I changed the will for you?

72
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,000
From the beginning,

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
I don't seem to have done
anything to you.

74
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,439
Or is it because
you have feelings for Lin Xintong?

75
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,920
Qin Moyao, don't try to sow discord.

76
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,519
I know you've contacted a lot of people,

77
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,120
but they all charge too much.

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,839
I'll leave the card here.

79
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
Whether to do it or not,

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,639
it's your call.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,079
But I advise you to act quickly,

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,199
in case Lin Xintong
discovers something fishy.

83
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,839
It won't be as simple as
giving the money back.

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,920
Forgery of will and fraud

85
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,879
won't bring minor charges.

86
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,959
Do you know
you were in great danger tonight?

87
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,560
If I hadn't arrived in time,

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,639
you would have been discovered by them.

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Lin Xintong.

90
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,519
Qin Moyao,

91
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,000
so they really wanted me to die.

92
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,240
They have planned everything in advance,

93
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,480
and even bought insurance for me.

94
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,759
I saw them as the closest people to me,

95
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,879
but from the beginning,

96
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,480
they wanted me dead.

97
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,959
If you're feeling upset,

98
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
you can cry it out.

99
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,279
But promise me,

100
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,360
you won't do things
like you did tonight anymore.

101
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,240
I will worry.

102
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,600
I will be afraid.

103
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,079
Afraid of what?

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
Afraid of not having anyone
to cover for me anymore.

105
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
But who is going to cover for me?

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,800
I will cover for you.

107
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,160
Lin Xintong,

108
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,639
with me behind you,

109
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,399
you are not alone.

110
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,160
Chi Shan!

111
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,160
Why are you in such a hurry?

112
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,319
You didn't hand over the 60 million

113
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,079
to the person introduced
by Qin Moyao to handle,

114
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,959
did you?

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
What's wrong?

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,959
Is there a problem?

117
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,560
I found out who Lin Guofu's shares
were all given to.

118
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,040
Who?

119
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,279
Lin Guofu transferred his shares

120
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,240
to a woman named Wu Dongyue.

121
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,399
But Wu Dongyue is just holding them
for someone else.

122
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,559
The real shareholder of Hongfu
in the dark

123
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,960
is Qin Moyao.

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
What do you want from me?

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,320
So formal.

126
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,679
I wanted to buy Hongfu's shares,

127
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
but someone did it
one step earlier than me.

128
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,519
Was it you?

129
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,759
Mr. Chi, you think too highly of me.

130
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,879
How would I get so much money?

131
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,519
You do have.

132
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,559
Lin Guofu transferred

133
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,000
51 percent of his shares to you.

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Now you're
the biggest shareholder of Hongfu.

135
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,919
So what?

136
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,440
Shares are not cash.

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,639
Am I supposed to
sell all Hongfu's shares

138
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,720
and then buy them back with the money?

139
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Of course, you won't sell your shares.

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,279
So you pocketed my 60 million.

141
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,759
Now I'm penniless.

142
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,840
Mr. Chi, you seem to have forgotten

143
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,639
that the person was contacted
by you yourself.

144
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,159
I didn't participate in it at all.

145
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,039
How would I have pocketed your money?

146
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,960
The person was introduced by you.

147
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,559
Do you dare to say
it has nothing to do with you?

148
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,159
I've introduced so many people.

149
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,799
If each of them
comes to ask me for money,

150
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,480
wouldn't I be broke?

151
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
So, speaking of which,

152
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,759
you lost the share
you were supposed to give me.

153
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,720
That's not good news.

154
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,279
What are you playing at?

155
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,720
You set me up on purpose.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
I'm going to call the police right now

157
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,279
and accuse you of fraud.

158
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,440
Fine.

159
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,639
Call the police.

160
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
But you have to explain to the police

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,120
how you got the money.

162
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,679
Oh,

163
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,240
