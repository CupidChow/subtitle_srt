2
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:32,576
=Episode 28=

3
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:35,755
(It's My Turn to Protect You)

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,520
It's pretty late.

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,640
Why are you here?

6
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,359
If there's nothing else,

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,840
you may leave.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,799
Yuwei.

9
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,680
We've known each other for years.

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,239
Why are you being so indifferent?

11
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,760
Am I?

12
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,480
When you decided to leave me

13
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,040
for Lin Xintong

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,280
and blamed everything on me,

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,760
were you not indifferent?

16
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,359
Your words hurt me.

17
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,719
Chi Shan.

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
Stop pretending.

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
After all these years,

20
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,280
I thought I gave you advice,

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,519
and you helped me
deal with the Lin family.

22
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,799
But I just realized

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,319
I have always been a pawn in your hand.

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,959
I'm really stupid.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,120
You're not stupid.

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,239
As soon as you found out
I was unreliable,

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,080
you sided with Qin Moyao.

28
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,080
In terms of judging the situation,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,599
no one is better than you.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't get it.

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,039
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,919
How could I side with him?

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,599
How can I put myself in trouble?

34
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,400
Yuwei.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,800
You're lying to me.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,599
That's not good.

37
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,319
You are aware

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,919
that only you know

39
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,520
about my company.

40
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,800
The legal person is not even me.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
How did Qin Moyao find it out?

42
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,280
He's a nominal shareholder.

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,199
He has never managed Hongfu.

44
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,680
Among so many contracts of Hongfu,

45
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,039
why did he only find out about this one?

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,479
If you didn't tell him,

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
you tell me

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,599
how he found out.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Chi Shan, let go of me.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,159
Fine.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Since you don't want to tell me,

52
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,560
then explain another thing for me.

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,039
Xia Yuwei.

54
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,800
Can you tell me

55
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,960
why the surveillance card you gave me

56
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,520
was copied today?

57
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,280
Are you kidding?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
If it's copied,

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,520
how can it be found out?

60
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,080
Don't you know the detailed information

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,960
of the video includes
the last modification time?

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,120
How could you...

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,919
If you dare to betray me,

64
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,080
you shouldn't worry
about being discovered by me.

65
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Xia Yuwei.

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,400
I trusted you too much.

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,800
I didn't expect you to betray me.

68
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,639
I was wrong about you.

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,520
Where's the copy?

70
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,280
Give it to me.

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,039
Chi Shan.

72
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,800
I really have deleted it.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,319
You're lying.

74
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,639
I really didn't give it to him.

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,240
I'll go get it for you now.

76
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,240
Here it is.

77
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,120
Chi Shan.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,319
I was wrong.

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,839
Chi Shan.

80
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,279
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,639
Chi Shan.

82
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,199
Chi Shan, I won't do it again.

83
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,399
Please forgive me, Chi Shan.

84
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,680
I won't do it again, Chi Shan.

85
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,879
I won't do it anymore.

86
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,879
How dare you betray me.

87
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,800
Why are you drinking?

88
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,600
No reason.

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,439
We haven't had a drink
together in a long time.

90
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,839
Do you remember our first drink?

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,519
You deliberately got me drunk.

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,759
As a result, you were not drunk at all.

93
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,839
You were just fooling me.

94
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,639
I didn't lie to you.

95
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,480
I just said I had too much to drink,

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
but I didn't say I was drunk.

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,519
You're quibbling.

98
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,959
You just wanted to take advantage of me.

99
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,920
If I had chosen

100
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,560
to trust you from the beginning,

101
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
maybe by now we would have

102
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,199
put Chi Shan in jail.

103
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,879
Don't worry.

104
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,279
It will be over soon.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
Chi Shan has lost everything.

106
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,879
When I get the evidence...

107
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,199
You can't find it.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,319
Qin Moyao.

109
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,079
Chi Shan has destroyed all the evidence.

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,079
The evidence left

111
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,399
is unfavorable to you.

112
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,160
Qin Moyao.

113
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,040
You've been protecting me.

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
This time,

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
