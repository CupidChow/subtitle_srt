00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:32,576
= Episode 27 =

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,392
(I'm in Control)

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
You've been having a copy

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,960
of evidence
of Chi Shan's homicide, right?

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,359
Since you know it,

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,039
I can't believe
you wait until now to find me.

8
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,560
I've been looking for concrete evidence,

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,880
but Chi Shan has been very cautious.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,640
Since you two have already fallen out,

11
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,560
it's not impossible
for me to cooperate with you.

12
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,239
Qin Moyao.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,079
You deceived Chi Shan and me before.

14
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,400
How can I cooperate with you again?

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,120
I promised someone.

16
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,959
I won't lie anymore.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,239
Lin Xintong?

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,439
You're right.

19
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,000
I indeed have a way out,

20
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,920
but I couldn't

21
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,560
show you my trump card now.

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,719
However,

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,680
I can exchange another piece of news.

24
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,959
Chi Shan has another company

25
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,680
from his foster father.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
He's currently using this company

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,359
to bring down Hongfu.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,159
All he wants is still to get Hongfu.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,519
I've sent the company information

30
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,520
to your phone.

31
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,080
About your account information,

32
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,039
I will have someone remove it.

33
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,680
Xia Yuwei,

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,039
you can think

35
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,520
about my offer.

36
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,280
Come in.

37
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,639
It's finished?

38
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,400
According to the VAM,

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,319
as long as Hongfu doesn't

40
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,479
reach the predetermined turnover
next month,

41
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,319
they will pay a large amount of money.

42
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,840
How's their market share right now?

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,159
They are currently still short

44
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,759
of 20 percent of the turnover.

45
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,759
I don't think they can make it.

46
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,319
It's this one.

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,479
Are you sure?

48
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,840
I've read the documents
between Hongfu and Qin Group.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
The schemes
and wording are exactly the same.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,759
Chi Shan wants

51
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,680
to use the same method
his foster father used on Qin Group

52
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,560
to completely bring down Hongfu.

53
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,159
So, he can take Hongfu over.

54
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,639
We need to find the loopholes.

55
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,039
We can't let him succeed.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,759
I'll answer a call.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
Lin Xintong,

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,599
you've considered for too long.

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,919
Looks like you want to refuse me.

60
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,160
I'll give you all my shares.

61
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,959
You want Hongfu, don't you?

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,959
I'll give you all my shares.

63
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,000
What I want is not just Hongfu.

64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,319
I want to destroy

65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,279
whatever you want most.

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,279
If you don't agree,

67
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,680
I can only destroy him.

68
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,759
I agree.

69
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,519
What did you just say?

70
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,680
Say it again.

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,879
Hongfu Group sent us a lawyer's letter,

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,399
declaring our contract invalid.

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
Why?

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,079
What reason do they have to do this?

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,770
(The Civil Legal Act is Invalid)
It says according to

76
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,759
(Lawyer's Letter)
Article 154 of the Civil Code,

77
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,360
if the malicious collusion of the actor
and the opposite party

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,879
damages the legitimate rights
and interests of others,

79
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,120
then the civil legal act
will be invalid.

80
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,720
They found evidence,

81
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,040
proving that we set a trap for Hongfu,

82
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,399
(Lawyer's Letter)
so this contract should be invalid.

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,000
It also mentioned Article 157.

84
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,879
Your company

85
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,759
should return the money obtained

86
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,040
because of this contract.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,079
Get out.

88
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,839
Get out!

89
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,720
It was you, wasn't it?

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,560
I guess you've already
received the lawyer's letter.

91
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,839
You're too careless.

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
The third-party company you used

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,279
is the one you and Xia Yuwei used
for getting money.

94
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Don't forget

95
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,519
I found someone

96
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,839
to help you with that.

97
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,079
With a simple check,

98
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,639
I can get something on you.

99
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,720
Are you teaching me how to do things?

100
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,279
The second mistake you made is

101
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,240
that you used the same trick
as your foster father.

102
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,240
I remember clearly

103
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,000
how my family went bankrupt.

104
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,199
I will never let it happen

105
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,959
to Hongfu.

106
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,959
Hongfu is your biggest enemy.

107
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,279
I am Hongfu's largest shareholder.

108
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,600
Don't you remember?

109
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,319
Looks like you lost again, Mr. Chi.

110
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,920
You had another debt to me before.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,920
How about you settle up now?

112
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,480
I lost?

113
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,680
You think I would lose to you?

114
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,000
You wish.

115
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
Qin Moyao.

116
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,920
I have a trump card.

117
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,279
I will make you suffer

118
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,784
and regret for the rest of your life.

119
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,240
I've warned you.

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,079
Do not lay a finger on her.

121
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,279
Or I will kill you.

122
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,279
We'll see.

123
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,519
(March 19, 2023 Sunday)

124
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,639
(You may leave.)

125
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,039
(What does this mean?)

126
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
(As long as you promise to leave Tong,)

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,600
(all of this is yours.)

128
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,559
(Am I a beggar?)

129
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,759
(Chi Shan,)

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,120
(your foster father
made a mistake back then.)

131
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,399
(You can't make the same mistakes.)

132
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
(I already knew you changed the will.)

133
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,039
(If I make this public,)

134
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,279
(you'll go to jail.)

135
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
(Considering)

136
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,759
(Tong and you have been together
for so many years,)

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,279
(I'll let you off this time.)

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,799
(Let me off?)

139
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,919
(Right now, you should kneel)

140
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,960
(and beg me to let you off.)

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
(You get rid of me with little money?)

142
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,440
(No way.)

143
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,519
(What I want is the Hongfu.)

144
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,399
(Mr. Lin.)

145
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
(You're getting old.)

146
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,519
(You can hand over Hongfu Group)

147
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,080
(and Tong to me.)

148
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,679
(You...)

149
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,200
(Since you insist on pushing me,)

150
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,879
(I have no choice
but to take legal action.)

151
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,159
(I'm pushing you?)

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,440
(You're forcing me.)

153
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,759
(Mr. Lin.)

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,159
(I told you.)

155
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,559
(You have a heart disease.)

156
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
(Eating too much Digoxin)

157
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,200
(isn't good for you.)

158
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
(Mr. Lin.)

159
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,039
(Mr. Lin.)

160
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,360
(Someone, help!)

161
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,639
(Help!)

162
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,440
(Mr. Lin.)

163
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,320
(Mr. Lin.)

164
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,559
(Wake up.)

165
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,080
(Mr. Lin.)

166
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,919
