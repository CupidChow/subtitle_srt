3
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:35,136
(I Have a Bad Temper. Try Harming Her)

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,520
Have you fallen for her?

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,679
(He really gave up the plan)

6
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,719
(because of Lin Xintong.)

7
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,560
(I can't let him stay
in the Lin family anymore.)

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,159
Qin Moyao.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,239
How did you know it was me?

10
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,079
My nose is quite sensitive now.

11
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,840
I smelled your scent.

12
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,239
It's so late.

13
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,519
Is something wrong?

14
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,079
Nothing.

15
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,560
I just came to see
if you're sleeping well.

16
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,680
With you guarding outside,

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,400
I feel at ease every night.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
(Lin Xintong,)

19
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,040
(tell me,)

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,639
(what should I do)

21
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,840
(to avoid hurting you?)

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,439
Hello.

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,639
Miss Lin,

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
you asked me to investigate Xia Yuwei.

25
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,479
I found something.

26
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,240
What did you find?

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,319
I'll come to pick you up.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,680
Let's talk outside.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,159
Alright.

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,680
Mo.

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Mo.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Mo.

33
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,520
Miss.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,319
Miss, you forgot.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Mo took a half-day leave today

36
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
to visit his mother.

37
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,319
Before he left, he told you

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,879
to stay put at home,

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,039
and wait for him to come back.

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
When he comes back, tell him

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,199
I have something to do
and I'm going out with a friend.

42
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,479
Yes.

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,039
Zhou Mo.

44
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,960
Where are we going?

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,759
Aren't you going to tell me about Yuwei?

46
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,800
Zhou Mo.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,840
Zhou Mo.

48
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,919
Zhou Mo.

49
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,960
Zhou Mo, where are you going?

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,000
That woman didn't lie to us.

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,039
She is blind indeed.

52
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,800
Don't touch me!

53
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,199
But she's quite beautiful.

54
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,280
Who are you?

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,199
Going somewhere?

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
Stay and play with us.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,960
Don't touch me!

58
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,759
Help!

59
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,280
You are really tough.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
This woman is pretty tough.

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
Don't leave.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,879
Why are you screaming?

63
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,960
Scream, keep screaming.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
Miss Lin.

65
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,879
It should be that woman, right?

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,879
Lower your voice.

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,279
Later, I will take her
to the underground garage.

68
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,600
You know what to do, right?

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,519
Yes.

70
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,639
Just scare her.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,839
Force her to fire her bodyguard.

72
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,000
Absolutely don't get physical.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,040
Got it?

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,720
Understood.

75
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,800
We'll be waiting.

76
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Go ahead.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,439
Let's go.

78
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,000
Gentlemen.

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,879
Gentlemen,

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,720
do you want to earn some extra money?

81
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,800
More money?

82
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,959
Sure.

83
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,879
(Qin Moyao,)

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,959
(didn't you warn me not to touch her?)

85
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,759
(I wonder)

86
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,120
(if you really are as capable
as you say you are.)

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,199
Why are you here?

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,199
Waiting for you.

89
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,759
Where is Lin Xintong?

90
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,800
She'll be back in a bit.

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
Where did you take her?

92
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,319
Don't panic.

93
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,240
I just got some people to scare her.

94
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,639
Where is she?

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,439
She's fine.

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,680
She's in the nearby underground garage.

97
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
Behave yourself.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Bite?

99
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,879
Come here.

100
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,399
Behave yourself!

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Do you hear me?

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,759
Such smooth skin.

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,199
Who are you?

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,759
Who are you?

105
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,800
Tell me, who sent you?

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,120
I don't know.

107
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,920
Just a woman.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,920
A woman?

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
She was wearing a necklace.

110
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,319
A diamond one

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,680
with a blue heart-shaped pendant.

112
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,839
Very shiny.

113
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,839
I don't know anything else.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Get lost!

116
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,360

178
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,159
I'm just teaching her a lesson.

179
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,559
Mo,

180
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,879
tell them now.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
That wasn't me.

182
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080

184
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,600
(Come here.)

186
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,919
(Do you hear me?)

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
Mo,

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,679
I really just happened to pass by.

189
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,039
It wasn't me.

190
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,200
(Delete the video)
You have to believe me.

191
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,399
It really wasn't me.

192
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
I've warned you before.

193
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,320
I have a bad temper.

194
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,080
Seems like I didn't make myself
clear enough.

195
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,453
