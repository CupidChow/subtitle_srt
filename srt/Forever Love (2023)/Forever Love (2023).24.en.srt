Tong,

5
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,759
give me a few minutes,

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,119
just a few minutes.

7
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,679
I'll confess everything to you.

8
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,560
You're going to confess to me?

9
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:54,719
Yes.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,920
Tong.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,240
I regret it.

12
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,479
I want to tell you everything.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,200
Go ahead.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,120
What are you doing?

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,959
Tong,

16
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,879
I was wrong before.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,480
It wasn't until today that I realized

18
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,879
I really couldn't let you go.

19
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,879
It's all Yuwei's fault.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,120
I shouldn't have listened to her

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
to hurt you so much before.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,280
She made all the plans.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Tong,

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,840
she badmouthed

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,879
your father,

26
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,480
saying he'd stop at nothing
to achieve his goals

27
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,879
and even forced
his subordinate into death.

28
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,840
She also told me

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
if I married you,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,959
I'd be made your father's scapegoat.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
I was stupid for a moment,

32
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,480
so I believed her words.

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,599
Chi Shan,

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,520
how much longer do you
pretend to be innocent?

35
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,599
It was clearly you who killed my father.

36
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't you admit it?

37
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,039
Tong,

38
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,439
I really didn't do anything.

39
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,240
I've told you so many times

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
your father's death was an accident.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
If you didn't kill him,

42
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,000
then why did you steal his hair?

43
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,520
You still don't know until today

44
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,240
that strand of hair was not his.

45
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,319
And the concentration
of digoxin in the hair

46
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,840
can't be detected at all.

47
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,400
You and Qin Moyao set a trap for me.

48
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,280
If we didn't do that,

49
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
how would we know
that you were the murderer?

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,479
Lin Xintong,

51
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,360
do you think
you can threaten me like this?

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
You don't have
any solid evidence at all.

53
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,280
There will be, sooner or later.

54
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,680
What a pity.

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,560
I originally wanted
to reconcile with you.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
But since you insist
on turning against me,

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,639
I can't be nice to you as planned.

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,199
How are you going to treat me badly?

59
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,680
If you have the guts, kill me.

60
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,960
Don't be afraid.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,479
Why would I kill you?

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,919
I haven't gotten your shares yet.

63
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,719
I'll still be as good to you as before.

64
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,199
Have you forgotten?

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,759
We will get married.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Qin Moyao.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,399
Chi Shan,

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,480
you'd better leave here now.

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
Don't be too complacent.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
The game has just begun.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,079
I will be enjoying it with you.

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,959
What are you here for?

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,639
What are you going to do?

74
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,279
Using yourself as bait
to induce him to kill you?

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,319
Lin Xintong,

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,240
why are you so foolish?

77
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,720
This is none of your business.

78
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,000
As long as it's about you,

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,959
it's my business.

80
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,120
Why are you treating me like this?

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm the daughter of your enemy.

82
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,399
My father killed your father.

83
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,240
Qin Moyao, you don't have to do this.

84
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,560
Leave.

85
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,519
Lin Xintong.

86
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,399
You know everything now.

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,959
Yes,

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,279
I know everything.

89
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,839
I know it all.

90
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,600
Qin Moyao,

91
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,519
it's our family who owes you.

92
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,639
I can't face you anymore.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,360
This isn't important.

94
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,800
It's not your fault.

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
What I care about is you,

96
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,319
no matter who you are.

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,920
It's very important.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Now I finally know

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,839
why you came to my house

100
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,519
and did those things.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,480
But my father made you suffer a lot.

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,160
Why do you still protect me
again and again?

103
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,000
Because I love you.

104
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Ever since I realized
my feelings for you,

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,439
I can't do anything else.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800

I can't be with you without a qualm,

nor do I have the right

113
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,680

114
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,560
and be good to me.

Don't come to see me anymore.

119
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,560
Can you please not say things like that?

I can't.
