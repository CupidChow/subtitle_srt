Directly in front of you,

a palm's distance away is your plate.

7
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,960

For convenience,
I'll put soup in the cup.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,719

You're smart.
Now, try to find the glass.

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,800
Miss Lin, Mr. Chi is back.

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
He brought people from the funeral home.

33
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,879
He wants to discuss
about Mr. Lin's funeral.

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,159
Okay, take them to the living room.

35
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,592
Yes.

36
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,759
Miss Lin, that's all for the funeral.

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,960
According to your request,

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
we've selected three good cemeteries.

39
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,360
Would you like to confirm now?

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Tong, I think
the cemeteries look similar.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,039
Why don't you let them decide?

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,479
How about the one in Xishan.
It's halfway up the mountain.

43
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,719
It's convenient to drive in.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,520
It's not far from here.
You can often visit.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,879
Is the scenery good there?

46
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,159
Yes, the sea can be seen.

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,319
I'll pick the one he suggested.

48
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Okay, Miss Lin, we will prepare for it.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,919
I'm sorry, Tong.

50
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,479
I didn't tell you in advance.

51
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
I know you want to find the murderer

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,919
to make your dad rest in peace.

53
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,120
But he has been dead for many days.

54
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,840
You can't always leave him
in the hospital.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,280
We should put him to rest.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,199
As I said,
the hospital has made a conclusion.

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,199
You're right.
I shouldn't be too paranoid.

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll hold the funeral
as soon as possible.

59
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,680
Okay, it's about time

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,079
to execute your father's will.

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,399
I've made an appointment
with the lawyer, Mr. Wang.

62
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,720
He will get a clear account
of your dad's assets.

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,519
We'll handle all the procedures at once.

64
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,560
Dad, today you were buried.

65
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,879
I finally realized that you left me.

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,759
They say you can see the sea.

67
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,879
Can you see it?

68
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,079
Mom was buried at sea.

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,480
Now you can see her every day.

70
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,639
You promised to be
with me for a lifetime.

71
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,160
But I didn't even see you one last time.

72
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,319
You liar.

73
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,720
Miss Lin, you can have some
tofu thick soup after the funeral.

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
It will make you feel better.

75
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,879
You seem to know a lot about funerals.

76
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,120
I arranged my father's funeral myself.

77
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,879
You must have been in a lot of pain.

78
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,120
I remember many debt collectors came
on the day of the funeral.

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,879
My dad owed a lot of money.

80
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,519
They yelled loudly at my dad's funeral.

81
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,720
They threw eggs, spat,
and trampled on the wreath.

82
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,759
They even forced me to kneel

83
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,759
and asked me to pay them back.
My mom had a stroke from the anger.

84
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,879
I will never forget that day in my life.

85
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,759
How did your dad pass away?

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,240
Is such a big investment feasible?

87
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,920
Don't worry. My friend won't trap me.

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,000
(Moyao, our family is bankrupt.)

89
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,160
(I can't find your dad.
I'm worried about him.)

90
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,279
Isn't he the boss of the Qin Group?

91
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,360
Why did he commit suicide?

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,079
Dad.

93
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,839
Dad.

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
Dad.

95
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,199
You don't need to know about that.

96
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,319
Mo, thank you for choosing
a good cemetery for my dad.

97
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,519
You're welcome.

98
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,360
Eat it while it's warm.

99
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,759
(Chi Shan is in a hurry
to hold the funeral.)

100
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,519
(He must be related
to Lin Guofu's death.)

101
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,840
(Now she's alone.)

102
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
(How can she protect herself?)

103
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
No matter what,

104
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,159
I will find the murderer.

105
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,399
You don't suspect me anymore?

106
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,120
Did I say that?

107
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,200
- Miss Lin.
- What's the matter?

108
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,759
Someone at the door asked me
to give this to you.

109
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,159
What is it?

110
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,840
A USB drive?

111
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Did he say anything?

112
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,279
He said Zhou Mo is not Zhou Mo.

113
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,519
He said you would know
through the USB drive.

114
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,840
I don't get it.

115
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,159
