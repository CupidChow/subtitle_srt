=The Truth Is About to Come Out=

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,440
Here you are.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Thank you.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,430
No need to be so polite.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,400
Didn't you publicly say you want to marry me?

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,840
Come on. Mr. Yan,

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,040
that's enough.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,560
Tell me everything you know now.

21
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,550
Of course.

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,480
You exchanged yourself for the information.

23
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,710
I will definitely not let you down.

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,180
(Archive)

25
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,590
You are truly capable.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,790
You actually could get the archives

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,310
from the Patrol Station.

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,710
However, I have reviewed this

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,280
and did not find anything unusual.

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,840
I have

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,120
had someone analyze it carefully.

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
Ordinary people can't find issues.

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,190
But according to the autopsy report,

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,590
Mr. Cheng got several gunshots,

35
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,430
but the final fatal wound

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
was located in the heart area.

37
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,690
According to the ballistic trajectory

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,190
and the burn marks from the bullet holes,

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
the deceased is only one meter away

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,520
from the muzzle.

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,590
Do you mean

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
my dad may be killed by his companion?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,310
Evidence never lies.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,750
Based on the location of death,

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,430
his companion could not be excluded.

46
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,030
Are you saying

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
Cheng Feng is also a suspect?

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,030
Impossible!

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
He wouldn't do that.

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,470
Based on all the evidence available now,

51
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,910
he can't get away from this.

52
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,000
Because all the testimonies

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,800
are all his own words.

54
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,080
Whether he lied,

55
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,360
we don't know.

56
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,030
The car mentioned in the file...

57
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,900
(An old Jeep)

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,470
I seem to have seen it somewhere before.

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
I remember.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Ru,

61
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,310
why are you still awake so late?

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
I heard some noise outside, so I came out.

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
You

64
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,330
didn't sleep in the middle of the night.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,310
What are you doing here?

66
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm here to get some stuff.

67
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,430
The Station needs them tomorrow.

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Let's go home.

69
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,540
(Archive)

70
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,480
Interesting.

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
It seems

72
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,240
I need to make Mr. Cheng speak truth.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,390
All right, it's getting late.

74
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Go to bed early.

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,070
I'll find out the details for you.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
Good night, Miss White Peony.

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Cheng Ru.

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,680
White Peony is my stage name.

79
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,040
After tonight, I won't need it anymore.

80
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
From now on, call me Cheng Ru.

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,600
Good night, Cheng Ru.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,440
Good night.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
He has been here for half a day.

84
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,790
Yeah.

85
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,790
What's wrong with him?

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,070
Why is he drinking in silence?

87
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,390
He is the one that White Peony mentioned.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,840
It's him?

89
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,710
Yeah.

90
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,830
What are you looking at?

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Get lost.

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,870
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go.

93
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,430
Mr. Cheng,

94
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,630
you don't seem to be in a good mood.

95
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,590
What?

96
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,480
You pity me too?

97
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,310
Both of us are heartbroken.

98
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,240
You really don't see yourself as an outsider.

99
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
You are also at home.

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
What to do?

101
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,920
I only made breakfast for two people.

102
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,110
All right.

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,310
Send them to my and Yan Liang's room.

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Not good.

105
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,430
I'm afraid you will think I poisoned it.

106
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,790
Is that so?

107
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,120
Then don't eat.

108
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't be angry.

109
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,680
My dad used to educate me

110
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
not to waste food.

111
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,510
Look.

112
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,550
Others don't want it.

113
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,150
But it still tastes yummy, right?

114
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
I asked you to disappear.

115
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,000
Why are you back?

116
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,600
You should ask the President.

117
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,960
Why doesn't he want me to leave?

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
You?

119
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
A dissolute singer. Are you worthy?

120
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,910
Yes, it's me.

121
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
I am a dissolute singer.

122
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,750
I can sing into his heart.

123
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,240
I can give him

124
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,000
whatever he wants.

125
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,040
But what about you?

126
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
It seems like you can do nothing at all.

127
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,840
Honey, getting angry is harmful to you.

128
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,470
Fine.

129
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,110
Fine.

130
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,630
Are you ok?

131
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,940
(Smith
Shareholder of Dongsheng Bank)

132
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,670
Mr. Smith,

133
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
what brought you here?

134
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,360
In China,

135
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,750
there is an old saying

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
that the dog that bites doesn't bark;

137
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,030
the dog that barks doesn't bite.

138
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,870
Which kind are you?

139
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,990
I don't understand.

140
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,870
Has the bank robbery case been finished?

141
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,030
Why bother wasting time on the opium case?

142
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,480
Is my money more important,

143
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,120
or is it more important for you

144
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,910
to serve the people and gain promotions?

145
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,910
You need to understand

146
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,150
who is your master.

147
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,150
The one who support you and help you succeed

148
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,550
is us,

149
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,030
not those Chinese people in the concession.

150
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,240
Mr. Smith,

151
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,390
we found clues

152
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,790
about the robbery case from the opium case.

153
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,790
I believe we will solve the case soon.

154
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,750
I will give you another seven days.

155
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,030
If there's still no progress,

156
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,510
I'll find a new one

157
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,600
to replace you,

158
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,390
including your head.

159
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,240
Do you understand?

160
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,510
Yes, sir.
