Well,

15
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,280
she left,

16
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,400
but why are you unhappy?

17
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,350
No.

18
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,710
I'm happy.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
All right.

20
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,920
Then let's continue our world of two.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Honey,

22
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,510
what are you nervous about?

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,710
Honey, how about

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
talking about the Prince's Gang?

25
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,520
I like

26
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,630
that you look so serious.

27
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,030
Mr. Yan, something bad happened.

28
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,590
Excuse me.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Mr. Cheng! Mr. Cheng!

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Mr. Cheng, I just received intelligence

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,120
Miss Bai was captured by the Prince's Gang.

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,430
Does she resemble?

33
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,270
Yes, she does.

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,150
Yes, she does.

35
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,980
(Chen Chuang
The head of the Prince's Gang)

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,150
Hello, Miss Bai.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Who are you?

38
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,080
You don't know me,

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,430
but I know your fiancé, Cheng Feng.

40
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,870
You don't seem to know much about him.

41
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,360
We have been estranged for quite some time.

42
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,910
If you have any grievances with him,

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,870
you can go find him directly.

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,520
You misunderstand me, Miss Bai.

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,590
Cheng Feng is not my enemy.

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
On the contrary,

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,710
we used to be friends.

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
Friends?

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,470
With you guys

50
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,470
who kidnapped people, sold opium at will

51
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,800
and did nothing but evil?

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,080
You are absolutely right.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,430
Your fiancé,

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
no,

55
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,150
your ex-fiancé Cheng Feng,

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,430
in order to seize power

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,240
and consolidate his position,

58
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,870
really did some small tricks

59
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,590
with us.

60
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,280
For example,

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
that time at the nightclub.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Miss Bai, you didn't get hurt, right?

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,110
Impossible!

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,600
He can't possibly have friends like you.

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
Yeah.

66
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,680
We think so too.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
We regarded him as a friend.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
But who knows

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,190
that he carried out a purge against us

70
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,600
and even took all of our opium away.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,750
In that case,

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
we are all victims.

73
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,920
What do you want to do?

74
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,950
Of course, I'll give him a lesson.

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,510
Our hands are tied.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Look at us.

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,360
Many of our guys

78
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,870
are dead or get injured.

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
I have to give them some explanation.

80
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,150
So

81
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,920
I will just trouble you a little.

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
But don't worry.

83
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
We will send you back soon

84
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,560
just as a statue

85
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,680
placed at his doorstep.

86
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,030
This way,

87
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,800
you can be with him forever.

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Wait a minute.

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,630
I have one last question.

90
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,270
Go ahead.

91
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,390
Who exactly wants to kill me?

92
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,680
You really need to think it over.

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
Have you offended anyone

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,270
