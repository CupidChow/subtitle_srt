I am not Yan Liang.

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,320
I am his younger brother,

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
Yan An.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,560
How long are you going to hide,

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,680
my dear brother-in-law?

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,480
After my investigation,

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,200
Mr. Yan actually has a twin brother.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
(Three years ago I went to study abroad.)

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,430
(When I was about to return,)

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,680
(I received the last call from my brother.)

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,590
(He urged me not to come back)

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,150
(and stay away from disputes.)

26
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,510
(Dongsheng Station)

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,660
(My brother treated me like a father.)

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,350
(I can't let him die without a clear reason.)

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,310
(So I used my brother's identity)

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,480
(to investigate the truth.)

31
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,870
(When I found out the only survivor,)

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,230
(Cheng Feng, has a fiancée,)

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,040
(I decided to approach her.)

34
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,760
(I wanted to get clues from her.)

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,560
(In order to gain her trust,)

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,350
(I decided to help her find the murderer.)

37
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,790
(However, what I never expected was)

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,200
(that during our time together,)

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,680
(I completely fell in love with her.)

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,840
So why are you doing this?

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Because of you.

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,590
Don't stop, keep going.

43
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,150
What brought you here?

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,150
Mr. Cheng,

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
you really change your mind easily.

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,850
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Miss Lisha,

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,190
I truly love you.

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,590
Smooth talker.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,710
Unreliable.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,030
Aren't we the same kind of person,

52
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,550
Miss Lisha?

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
You really resemble someone I know.

54
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,240
Is he also a bad person?

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,910
He's worse than you.

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
But you have already killed him.

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,080
His name is Yan Liang.

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,680
You must be crazy.

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,520
Isn't he living well?

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,800
Seems that he was indeed killed by you.

61
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,120
I just want a result.

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,800
The current President Yan

63
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,630
is his twin brother.

64
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,470
We were all deceived by him.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,310
I am the President of the Dongsheng Chamber,

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Yan Liang.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
Impossible.

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,710
If only you hadn't done those things,

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,430
you wouldn't be killed by me today.

70
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
Miss Lisha,

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,600
you underestimated me.

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,270
I am not a puppet to be manipulated.

73
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,680
You truly are a crazy person.

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,270
All right, let's stop here.

75
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,870
What did you put in my suitcase?

76
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,190
I'll be away for only several days.

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Why is it so heavy?

78
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,830
They are some stuff that you can use.

79
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,270
I also bought you

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,720
a few more sets of thicker clothes.

81
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,190
I'm afraid you might need

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
to make some connections over there,

83
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,800
so I prepared some money for you.

84
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,600
I put it in the compartment.

85
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,950
- And some...
- All right.

86
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you have any intentions?

87
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,830
I'll be away for a few days.

88
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,430
Do you intend to find another woman?

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,240
Yan An, if you really do this,

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,830
you know what I'm capable of.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Silly girl.

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
How could that be?

93
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,800
The Japanese are watching me closely.

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,560
The police have been trying to capture me.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,600
I had no choice but to let you

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,630
deliver the letter

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,870
to Mr. Zhou this time.

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,430
So you must promise me

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,470
to take good care of yourself.

100
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
Ok, I promise you.

101
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,510
Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
I was just joking before.

103
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,040
I understand.

104
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
I will pay attention to safety.

105
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,070
Now the weather has turned cooler.

106
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,750
You should wear thicker clothes too.

107
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Take care of yourself.

108
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,680
Eat well every day.

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Do you know?

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,070
You promised me

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,390
your life belongs to me.

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
So now I want you to

113
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,240
take good care of it for me temporarily.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
I promise you.

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,690
I can't bear to part with you.

116
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,040
I can't bear to part either.

117

This gift is a bit special.

118
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll keep it well for you first.
