87
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,160
you're hard to figure out.

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,190
Why would you be concerned

89
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,040
about a singer like me?

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,480
Miss Peony, don't belittle yourself.

91
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
I heard you're the daughter
of the former chief inspector.

92
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,750
Would you be interested

93
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,600
in becoming my second concubine?

94
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,360
It's our first meeting.

95
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,800
I didn't expect you

96
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,000
to say this to me.

97
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,190
What you thought was a first meeting

98
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600

106
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,600
that there's opium trafficking
in the venue.

107
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,080
Please cooperate with us
in the investigation.

108

- Opium?
- This is a serious matter.

This is not something to mess with.

110
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm Yan Liang, the president

111
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,510

112

President Yan,

117
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,120
is this one of your associates?

118
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
He was caught in the act.

119
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,720
How do you explain this?

120
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
President, President,
you must believe me.

121
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,280
I was forced.

122
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,270
I swear I won't touch it again, President.

123
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,550
Please forgive me.

124
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,630
President Yan,

125
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,720
using lynching
and obstructing official duties,

126
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,270
do you think we don't exist?

127
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,390
Inspector Cheng, you misunderstand.

128
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,080
I was afraid he would resist.

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,020
If he didn't cooperate,
it would be troublesome.

130
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,120
Our chamber members
are all law-abiding citizens.

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
Only I am deeply opposed to evil.

caused trouble,
