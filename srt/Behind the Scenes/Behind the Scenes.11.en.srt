I haven't tasted your dishes in a long time.

15

I remember you used to love cooking.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
Yeah.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,710
I love having the whole family together,

18
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,710
eating the meals I prepared.

19
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,710
Very warm.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Very happy.

21
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,790

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,120
I should have listened to you.

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,430
I shouldn't get involved in this matter.

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,280
I will never let you get hurt again.

27
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,150
I do want to go back to the original life.

we can definitely do it.

Come on. Let's eat.

31
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
Mr. Cheng,

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
let him go.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,750
This is the superior's intention.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Mr. Cheng,

35
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,880
thank you for your hospitality.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,920
We will meet again someday.

37
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,150
We'll see.

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
You are...

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,800
You don't need to know who I am.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,000
My superiors sent me to save you,

41
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,030
but

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,190
you should remember

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,120
the Patrol Station is not your backyard

44
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,710
where you can come and go as you wish.

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
If there is a next time,

46
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,280
I may not help you.

47
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,030
Thank you, sir.

Everybody,

00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,450
(Admission by ticket only)
Today is White Peony's

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,710
last performance.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
I believe you all feel regret

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,590
about her departure.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,190
Now let's welcome her with applause.

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Miss White Peony,

55
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,230
may I ask why you decided to step back

56
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,200
after becoming the new pillar?

57
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,240
Do you have any plans?

58
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,750
Could it be that you have an engagement?

59
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,800
Miss, are you planning to retire?

60
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,000
Good evening, friends.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,160
Today, taking this opportunity,

62
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,750
I'd like to announce something.

63
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,160
The reason why I leave the music industry

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,270
is indeed because I am engaged.

65
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,560
Who is she getting married to?

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,400
Going to get married?

67
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,480
Which man is so lucky

68
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,560
that he can marry her?

69
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,720
Exactly.

70
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,160
The one I want to marry is...

71
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,950
Yan Liang?

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,870
She is going to marry Mr. Yan.

73
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,360
Congratulations!

74
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,560
I know how your dad died.

75
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,160
Follow me to find the truth.

76
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,590

79

Why?

80
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,480
Tell me why it turned out like this.

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,870
What exactly did I do wrong?
