(Half a year ago
Dongsheng Central Bank)

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,140
(Open for business)

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,030
(Closed for business)

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,280
Isn't there still an hour until closing?

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm in a hurry to make a remittance.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,840
Please make an exception.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,950
The bank is conducting a routine inventory

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,990
and will not be open for business.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,710
Just do me a favor, please.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,230
Can you not understand me?

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,320
Get lost!

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,950
How can you do business like this?

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,700
(Closed for business)

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
Don't move, everyone.

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,680
Squat properly.

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Behave yourself!

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,790
The sea is calm and tranquil.

32
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,350
Get started.

33
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,760
- Sir...
- Come here.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,150
Sir, please don't kill me.

35
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,070
Behave yourself!

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
I'll cooperate.

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
- Go.
- Don't kill me...

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
Don't kill me.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
This one is good.

40
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,300
That's quite a lot.

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,150
Give me this one.

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,550
It's all mine.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
We become rich.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,470
Hurry up.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
This thing in my hand,

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,870
everyone should recognize it, right?

47
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,030
What is this?

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,190
Bomb...

49
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,150
- Speak louder!
- Bomb!

50
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,150
As long as you cooperate with us

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
to make us pack this money properly,

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
I promise

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,560
you can go back before dinner.

54
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,710
Of course,

55
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,280
if someone wants to play the hero,

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,120
that's fine,

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,590
then...

58
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,030
The game is on.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,190
What do you want to do?

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,630
I said I'm here to report a case.

61
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
What case?

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
80 million in the bank was stolen.

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,520
I advise you not to challenge my patience.

64
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,360
Don't forget where you are right now.

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,120
You must be surprised to see me again.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
As the only informed person in the case,

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,920
you

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,080
should be more clear about that money.

69
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,190
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,430
You are creating a smokescreen.

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,160
Don't think I would fall for that.

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,630
How serious is it to slander an inspector?

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,150
You know that?

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,390
An inspector incited others to kill me.

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,310
What kind of crime is that?

76
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,190
Everything requires evidence.

77
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,710
Otherwise, Mr. Yan,

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
do you think you could leave here today?

79
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,240
I've already said

80
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,920
I am a law-abiding good citizen.

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,950
I didn't do anything wrong.

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,390
What evidence do you have to keep me here?

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm going.

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
Mr. Cheng,

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,360
if you don't like Miss Bai,

86
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,720
please tell me.

87
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,720
I happen to be in need of a gentle wife.

88
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,710
I'm off.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,510
Sorry, Miss Bai.

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,430
I hope you can understand what I did to you.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,160
But I can't let you go right now.

92
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,720
You don't mind keeping someone

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,870
who wants to kill you around.

94
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,190
If I don't meet your good intentions,

95
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,240
am I not a bit ungrateful?

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,830
There may be a deep misunderstanding.

97
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,390
But it doesn't matter.

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,310
I have already agreed

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,430
to give my life to you.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,720
Can you give me a little more time

101
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,190
so that I can prepare for the aftermath?

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,190
In this house,

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,160
all sharp objects have been removed,

104
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,390
including the mirror.

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
What?

106
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,070
Are you scared?

107
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,680
These are all done by the servants.

108
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,710
I don't know it.

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,190
They may

110
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,510
be not afraid I will get hurt,

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,190
but they're afraid you'll hurt yourself.

112
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,480
The new product from Muyun Shop.

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,430
Consider this my apology to you.

114
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,920
Your means of caring for women

115
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,270
is quite attentive.

116
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,750
But

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,270
if there isn't even a mirror

118
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,000
in a woman's room,

119
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,120
isn't it

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
a bit disrespectful to this woman?

121
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,920
Or

122
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,800
you want to use your eyes as a mirror?

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,510
You are shy, aren't you?

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
Am I not beautiful enough?

125
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm afraid I'll become lost

126
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,630
and be reluctant to let you go.

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,200
