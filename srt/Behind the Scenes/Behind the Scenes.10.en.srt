=Can I still Trust You?=

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:04,990
Good morning, Mr. Cheng.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Good morning, Mr. Cheng.

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,190
Mr. Cheng.

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,380
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Mr. Cheng.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,230
Congratulations on achieving new merits.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
In today's Morning News,

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,070
the whole layout is about you.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,480
(The Station will conduct an operation.)

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,320
Yeah.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,230
Mr. Cheng has made a significant breakthrough.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,150
The concession is expected to be peaceful.

25
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,630
Mr. Cheng,

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,350
shouldn't we ask to drink to celebrate?

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,560
- Is that so, guys?
- Is it?

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,790
- Yes.
- That's right.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,730
We really need to have a drink.

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,990
- Right.
- Let's celebrate it.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
In a few days.

32
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,480
There are some matters at home.

33
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,310
It seems that Mrs. Cheng is quite strict.

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,910
Come on.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Yang Ming,

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
tell the people in the Chamber

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,920
that the President is not doing well lately.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,350
Later, all the company's affairs

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,120
will be entrusted to me.

40
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,040
Is this the President's intention or...

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,590
Mrs. Yan, don't misunderstand.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,280
I didn't mean to offend.

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,470
Did you forget

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,240
this chamber was founded by my father?

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,710
He was able to become the President

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
because I recommended him.

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
What?

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
Are you questioning my abilities?

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
No.

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
It's just...

51
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,310
If we take away Yan Liang's power,

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,630
and he finds out,

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
will he...

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,280
What if he finds out

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,520
we both wanted to kill him before?

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,800
You need to understand, Yang Ming,

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,430
that I chose him back then

58
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,120
just because of the rules my dad set

59
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,280
that women can't be the President.

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,360
He is just my dog.

61
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,030
What do you want to do?

62
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,520
He likes to deliver things to the Station.

63
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,870
Why not send himself in there as well?

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,940
(Dongping Account Books)

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Sure.

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,910
Then I'll hand the books to the Station.

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,960
What is this thing?

68
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,800
This is my kindness for you.

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,710
If this gift is not valuable,

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,630
I will not accept it.

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Mrs. Yan, rest assured.

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,910
You will definitely like this gift.

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Mr. Yang,

74
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,680
your taste is getting worse and worse.

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,150
Ru, what brought you here?

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,430
You must be hungry, right?

77
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,870
Eat it while it's hot.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,590
Do you still remember my favorite dish?

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,310
Taste it, it will be cold soon.

80
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,310
Report.

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,710
Sir, we found evidence.

82
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,420
Have you confirmed it?

83
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,270
I've confirmed it.

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,740
Prepare the vehicle.

85
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,190
Notify Team One and Two quickly.

86
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,150
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,400
What's the rush?

88
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,560
Are you going on a mission?

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,630
I won't eat today.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,310
It's ok, I'll clean up.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Work is important.

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
I think I'll go home a bit late today.

93
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,630
After cleaning up, you go home early.

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Be safe.

95
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,860
(Archive)

96
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,000
What you see may not be the truth.

97
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,350
(Cheng Feng,)

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,630
(what are you hiding from me?)

99
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,600
(Can I still trust you?)

100
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,540
(The operation targeting opium smuggling...)

101
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
Mr. Cheng,

102
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,480
what brought you here?

103
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,860
(Arrest Warrant)

104
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,910
Yan Liang,

105
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,390
you are suspected of drug trafficking.

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
We lawfully arrest you.

107
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,120
Your fiancé,

108
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,230
no,

109
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,830
ex-fiancé Cheng Feng,

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
in order to seize power and profit

111
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,190
and consolidate his position,

112
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,800
he really made such a small move

113
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,310
with us.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,950
For example,

115
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,630
that time at the nightclub.

116
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,240
Speaking of Cheng Feng,

117
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,950
he's quite bold.

118
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,120
Our people said

119
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,430
he's just a policeman,

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,190
but he dared to trade opium with the Gang.

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,750
Ru, you have something on your mind?

122
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,470
No.

123
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,430
I'm a bit worried about you.

124
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,000
I happen to have something to say.

125
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Today we arrested Yan Liang.

126
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,510
He is suspected of trafficking opium.

127
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,040
He was finally brought to justice.

128
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,270
So I don't think you need

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,950
to work outside anymore.

130
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Places like the Grand World,

131
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,710
you know,

132
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,390
are full of mixed people and unsafe.

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
From now on,

134
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,630
just stay at home.

135
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
I will take care of you.

136
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Ok.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,830
But Xia usually treats me well.

138
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
I want to hold a ceremony

139
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,160
to say goodbye to them.

140
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,270
No problem.

141
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
I have one more thing.

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Ru,

143
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,670
will you marry me?

144
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
A lot has happened during this time.

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,270
I have also understood a lot.

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,320
Only by keeping you by my side

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,360
can I better protect you.

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,150
- So...
- How about

149
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,550
giving it to me at the ceremony?

150
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,550
I want more people to witness this moment.

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
Ok.

152
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
Here.

153
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,160
