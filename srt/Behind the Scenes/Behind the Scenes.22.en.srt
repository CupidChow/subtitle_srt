14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,880
You are awake.

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,640
Why are you?

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,550
Didn't I...

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,230
- You...
- It really wasn't me this time.

18
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,120
It was Cheng Feng who kidnapped you.

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,920
Didn't you always want me to disappear?

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm really not used

21
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,280
to you doing it this way.

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,680
Shouldn't the woman who robbed my man

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,510
disappear?

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,710
But now the nature is different.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,510
If you are with Yan An,

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,870
you're my sister-in-law.

27
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,950
How can I bear to let you get hurt?

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,190
No matter what,

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
thank you.

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,280
But Miss Lisha,

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,310
now I just want to go home.

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,030
Do you want to see Yan An?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,080
Don't worry.

34
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll take you to see a show.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,150
Inspector Cheng,

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
no,

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,470
Supervisor Cheng,

38
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,750
just do it.

39
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,750
Kill him.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,080
When he dies, you will have everything.

41
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,960
Do it.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,750
Darn it!

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Cheng Feng,

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
do you know what you're doing?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Someone! Someone!

46
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,430
Someone!

47
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,470
Kill them!

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,710
Don't shout, Mr. Yamada.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,310
Listening to the noise outside,

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,430
your men can't protect themselves too.

51
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,270
Cheng Feng,

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840
I can give you whatever you want.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,560
80 million, the position of Supervisor,

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,840
I promise.

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,750
We are the same kind of people.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,190
Why don't we cooperate and win together?

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120
What you said was right.

58
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,960
I love money.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,190
I love the feeling of wielding power.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
But I hope you understand

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,430
that you've broken my bottom line.

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,960
Even if I do too many bad things,

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,460
I won't betray the country and seek glory,

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,750
and use your weapons

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,870
to mutilate our countrymen.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Are you serious?

67
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,690
Will Yamada really want to use the arms

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
to deal with fellow countrymen?

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Why should I trust you?

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,190
I'm in your hands now.

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,830
Does it make sense if I lied to you?

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,510
Even if what you say is true,

73
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,480
why should I work with you?

74
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,360
How is this good for me?

75
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,720
All I want right now is your life.

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Mr. Cheng,

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,800
you can choose not to believe me.

78
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,390
You should know your situation

79
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,870
better than me.

80
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,000
After dealing with these issues,

81
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,830
will Yamada and Smith

82
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,920
really get you promoted

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
and make you rich?

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,270
You are so naive.

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,070
People who know too many secrets

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,510
often don't end well.

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
You should understand the principle

88
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,680
of killing the dog after the rabbit is dead.

89
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,150
Mr. Yan,

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
you don't need to set a trap for me.

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,560
This trick doesn't work on me anymore.

92
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,950
You'd better think about your own situation.

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,800
After all, you are no longer

94
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,190
of any use to me now.

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,390
You have to pay for your actions.

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,600
I have no intention of persuading you.

97
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,600
I just hope you can understand

98
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,190
if this batch of arms

99
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,190
will be used on our own countrymen,

100
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,950
many families will be destroyed

101
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,630
and many countrymen

102
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
will die under these fire.

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,910
You're an orphan.

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,510
The Japanese killed your parents.

105
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,350
What do you want to do?

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Don't play tricks.

107
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,560
Otherwise you'll die miserably.

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,040
You brought Yamada here.

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,440
I am the bait.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,870
When it's done, the credit goes to you.

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,400
You can pick up

112
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
my life anytime.

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,560
What do you think?

114
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,560
You'd better keep your word.

115
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,040
You can go with peace of mind.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll make up a good story for you

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,870
in tomorrow's newspaper.

118
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,400
Keep an eye on them.

119
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,790
Mr. Cheng,

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,930
everyone outside is under control.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,940
Please give instructions.

122
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,350
Very good.

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,830
Take them back and wait for a decision.

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,270
Mr. Yamada was assassinated.

125
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,220
The murderer has been brought to justice.

126
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,510
Take his body back to the morgue.

127
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,710
Collect all team members.

128
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,070
- Understand?
- Understood.

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,630
How is it, Mr. Yan?

130
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,510
I've already done something

131
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,070
that I promised.

132
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,600
Is it time for you to keep your promise?

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

134
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,630
Some things should have a conclusion.
