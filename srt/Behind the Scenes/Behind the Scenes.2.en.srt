15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
Mr. Yan,

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
we were wrong.

17
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,560
Please, let us go.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,600
Let me go.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,840
The Chamber prohibits the sale of opium.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,510
Why must you defy the law?

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,400
Just say a name.

22
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,590
You will suffer one less beating.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Ok.

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,910
Ok.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
There are also Wang Tian and Liang Yuan.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,310
Mr. Yan, we were wrong.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,790
We shouldn't sell opium with the gang.

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,910
We won't...

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,070
We won't do it again in the future.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,990
We won't.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
Ok.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,870
If you sell opium again,

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,760
you will ruin the future of others.

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,000
You can only blame yourselves.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,960
Right?

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,400
Mr. Yan, Miss Bai is here.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
You handle the rest.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,150
Nice to meet you, Miss Bai.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,410
Mr. Yan

40
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,750
ordered me to deliver you a cake,

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
as he would like to invite you out

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
to express his apologies in person.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,590
That Yan Liang has ill intentions.

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Stay away from.

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,870
You said you wanted to avenge my dad.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,030
What did you do?

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,470
(Bright Cake)
I'm doing this for you,

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
for this family.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,910
Miss Bai, have a taste.

50
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,710
Thank you.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,280
You didn't just invite me here

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,870
for a cup of coffee today, did you?

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,710
Don't think of me as that complicated.

54
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,000
I just simply

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,630
want to ask you out for a date.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,680
It seems you

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,430
have already received my gift.

58
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,630
I was just

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,470
returning it to its owner.

60
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,470
What do you mean?

61
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,240
Why do you have my father's badge?

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,630
You exert great effort to approach me.

63
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,630
What exactly do you want?

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't get me wrong.

65
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,680
I sincerely apologize

66
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
for bringing up the past of Mr. Cheng.

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,710
I just happened

68
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,630
to obtain this badge.

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
Just doing a favor.

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,630
As for the ins and outs of this matter,

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,710
Inspector Cheng Feng

72
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,520
should know better than I do.

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,240
(Why does Yan Liang look like the robber?)

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
(What on earth is going on?)

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Mr. Cheng...

76
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,920
Are you scared?

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,880
It's you, Ru.

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,040
Had a nightmare?

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,600
The patrol station has been very busy.

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,510
I really feel a bit overwhelmed.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Ru,

82
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,070
I shouldn't say that to you yesterday.

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
I know.

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,750
After the master was gone,

85
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,750
you seem to have changed a lot.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
I should show you more care.

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Ru,

88
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,630
how did you get this thing?

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
The master's badge.

90
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,310
It must be Yan Liang's trick.

91
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,390
I already told you

92
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,950
he approached you with bad intentions.

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
Why are you so excited?

94
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,360
Why is my dad's badge

95
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
in Yan Liang's hands?

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,750
You are the inspector.

97
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,310
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

98
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,590
Cheng Feng,

99
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,190
I am really disappointed in you.

100
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,870
What are you hiding from me?

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,040
Ru, believe me.

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,070
Things are not what you think.

103
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,630
Yes, I have hidden some things from you.

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm afraid you might get into danger.

105
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,270
In fact, I will never forget the face

106
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,360
of the person who stole the money

107
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,720
and shot my master.

108
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,870
Until that day

109
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,510
I saw him in the Grand World.

110
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,270
Yan Liang.

111
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,070
I'm Yan Liang, the president of Chamber.

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,950
Why didn't you tell me directly?

113
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,360
Am I really not trustworthy?

114
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,480
The one who died is your master,

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,920
my father.

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Do you think

117
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,310
I can forget all this hatred

118
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,510
just because you didn't tell me?

119
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,670
Ru,

120
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

121
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,600
Let me bear the hate alone.

122
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
To me, the master

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,240
is like my father.

124
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,510
I can't forget his death for a moment.

125
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
You know Yan Liang is the murderer.

126
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,310
Why don't you go catch him?

127
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,480
Why do you let him get away with it?

128
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
Ru,

129
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,600
I am a police officer.

130
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,600
This is the concession.

131
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,510
Catching someone relies on evidence.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,270
It's impossible to bring him to justice

133
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,430
based solely on my personal words.

134
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
You must listen to me.

135
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,200
Keep a distance from him.

136
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,040
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

137
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,480
I also don't want to lose you.

138
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,470
Trust me.

139
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,390
I won't let the master die with regrets.

140
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,830
(Yan Liang,)

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,830
(since the Patrol Station can't manage you,)

142
