14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,590
Mr. Yang, it's time.

15
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
Mr. Yang,

16
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,790
you want...

17
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,630
Well...

18
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,790
Isn't it obvious yet?

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,680
It's the matters of the Chamber.

20
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,400
There's no need to involve her, right?

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,710
I'm fine. You go first.

22
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,550
Don't worry.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,870
Neither of you can leave this door today.

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
By the way,

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,310
do you remember I taught you

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,910
to leave some room for others,

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,470
so we can meet again in the future?

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
We have worked together for so long.

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,400
Can't we sit down and discuss properly?

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
Does it have to be so tense?

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Very uncivilized.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
Yan Liang,

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,520
let me tell you the truth.

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,280
Since you set foot in this door today,

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,000
I never intended to let you leave alive.

36
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,910
Want to feel more like a man?

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Ok, let's settle the score carefully.

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,870
Then let's talk

39
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,630
about you accepting bribes from the Gang

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,430
and selling opium in the name of the Chamber.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,630
How should this score be settled?

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
It's been ten years.

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,910
I have followed you for ten years.

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,190
I work hard and endure complaints.

45
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,990
What am I doing this for?

46
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,590
I do this for the whole Chamber.

47
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,190
I want my brothers to live better.

48
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,560
Do I do wrong?

49
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,080
However, you

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,840
ignored those easily obtainable businesses

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,150
just for your invisible conscience.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
Brothers,

53
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,470
tell me

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
who is really the hindrance to the gang.

55
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,800
Have you ever thought

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,470
that these opiates

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,360
have led the ruin of their families?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,030
Have you ever asked them if they obey you?

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
What are you doing?

60
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,120
Are you crazy?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
In life,

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
the most important thing is to be happy.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
But as a leader,

64
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,680
the most important thing is to be wise.

65
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,070
Next time when you rebel,

66
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,630
it's best to find some reliable brothers.

67
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,150
What's more,

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,560
I don't sell opium

69
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,190
because I don't want my brothers

70
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,680
to become the sinners of a fallen nation.

71
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,230
But now...

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,190
Well played, Yan Liang!

73
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,590
Go.

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,870
No worries. I'm here.

75
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,510
The robber jumped into the river.

76
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,240
I went over to check

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,630
and found the robber had long vanished.

78
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,950
Then I returned to the crime scene

79
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,310
and saw both the car and money were gone.

80
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,360
This is the entire course of events.

81
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,670
My master...

82
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,800
My master also lost his life in action.

83
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,190
The top priority

84
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,830
is to help Mr. Smith

85
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,800
retrieve the lost 80 million.

86
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,630
I'll definitely bring the fugitive to justice

87
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,560
to avenge my master and brothers.

88
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Supervisor,

89
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,120
I don't care what method you use.

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,270
You must give me an explanation.

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,510
Yes, sir. We will.

92
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,430
Give me some time to investigate.

93
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

94
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,000
I hope you understand

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,070
the lives of your countrymen

96
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,870
are worthless in my eyes.

97
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,950
If you can't get my money back,

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,510
just bring your heads to see me.

99
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,710
Cheng Feng,

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
I hope you can pull yourself together,

101
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,800
take over the position,

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,560
investigate the robbery case thoroughly

103
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,270
and retrieve the lost 80 million.

104
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,310
I will give you another seven days.

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,630
If there is still no progress,

107
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,480
I will find a new one

108
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,430
to replace you,

109
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,390
including your head.

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
Do you understand?

111
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,350
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,430
If you want to rise to power,

113
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,950
why not tell me earlier?

114
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,560
Maybe I would agree.

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,190
Mr. Yan,

116
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,360
I am in your hands today.

117
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,750
You can do whatever you want.

118
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,140
Don't pretend to be a good person

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,920
in front of me.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,630
I'll give you one more chance.

121
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,560
Let's see if you can seize it.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,140
Apart from colluding with the Gang

123
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,630
to sell opium,

124
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,390
is there anything else you're hiding from me?

125
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
For example,

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
the missing 80 million

127
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,430
in the bank robbery case.

128
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,710
Yan Liang,

129
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,080
you are really forgetful.

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,200
Who has the 80 million?

131
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
I believe you know better than I do.

132
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,870
If I had 80 million,

133
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,750
would I need to sell opium?

134
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,750
I'll tell you, Yan Liang,

135
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,550
if you want to kill me, just do it directly.

136
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,750
Don't use this to set me up.

137
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,270
Don't get too agitated.

138
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm doing this to let the brothers see

139
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,080
what are the consequences

140
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,590
of betraying me.

141
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,390
Your turn.
