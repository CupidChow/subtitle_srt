Sorry, Miss Bai.

15

My life can't be given to you for now.

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
She still doesn't say anything.

Continue?

18
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,310
Miss Bai,

19
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,800
I don't know what happened

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,710
that caused such a big misunderstanding,

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,430
you even tried every means to kill me.

22
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,750
But I can responsibly tell you

23
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,240
that many things are not

24
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,400
as they seem.

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,550
I think we can

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,150
communicate in a more civilized manner.

27
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,750
What do you think?

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,030
Mr. Yan,

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,430
stop pretending to be so innocent.

30
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,190
I don't know how you got my father's badge.

31
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,150
But I know

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,470
his death

33
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,800
is related to you.

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,190
This is the reason I want to kill you.

35
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,310
As long as I am alive for a day,

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
I will not give up on killing you.

37
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,870
Unless

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,240
you kill me first.

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,080
I see.

40
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,560
It seems before it is resolved,

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,630
you plan to be with me for a lifetime.

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,800
With a beauty like you by my side,

43
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,190
I will certainly accompany you.

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
Interesting.

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,190
You make me more and more fascinated.

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,030
I'll take care of the rest.

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
You all go back first.

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
But...

49
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,830
Is she still not willing to eat?

50
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,310
It's been three days already.

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
If this continues,

52
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,630
I'm afraid something might happen.

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Why don't you eat?

54
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,160
Why don't you kill me?

55
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,190
It seems like you've misunderstood me.

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,510
Murder is against the law.

57
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,950
If you want to avenge your father,

58
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,360
then you can't take it so lightly.

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,390
Just give up after one failure?

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,190

61
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,240

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,310
You don't have the right to mention him.

64
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,870
You are unworthy.

65
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,070

66
