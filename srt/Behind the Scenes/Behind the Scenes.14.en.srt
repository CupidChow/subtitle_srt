14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Your turn.

15
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,190
Mr. Yan,

16
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,710
I have assigned someone to follow him.

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,120
You're a rare guest, Mr. Yang.

18
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,310
What can I do for you at this late hour?

19
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,310
I'm here to give you a grand gift.

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,030
Let's talk inside.

21
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,960
I have reached a dead end.

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,470
If you don't help me,

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,710
I will reveal

24
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,630
what I know.

25
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,990
What do you know?

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,080
You can eat randomly.

27
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,560
But you can't speak carelessly.

28
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,870
Your fiancée

29
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,960
probably don't know what you've done before.

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
The survivor of the bank robbery case

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
is not only you.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Go ahead.

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,520
What do you want?

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,190
You are much more sensible than Yan Liang.

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
Ok.

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,870
Then I'll make a long story short.

37
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,990
First,

38
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,000
I need a safe place.

39
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,030
During this period,

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
I can help you deal with Yan Liang.

41
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
Second,

42
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,150
I know that 80 million is all on you.

43
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,120
There are so much money

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
that you couldn't spend it all very soon,

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
- so...
- Ok.

46
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,110
I agree.

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Now,

48
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll take you to get some good rest.

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
Mr. Cheng,

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,270
you are indeed clever.

51
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
(No one can threaten me.)

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,270
(Why do you think you can?)

53
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,150
Have you made a choice?

54
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,270
Let me think it over.

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
The checkered one.

56
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Forget it.

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
Why?

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,800
That was given by your rival Lisha.

59
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,380
Are you sure you want me to wear this?

60
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,230
Boring!

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Why do you only have suits and overcoats?

62
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,190
They all look the same.

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,120
We're not going to a ball

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
and compete in beauty.

65
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,230
It makes sense.

66
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,230
Then this one.

67
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
This color isn't in style this year.

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,350
Ok, this one.

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
There is news.

70
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,730
Yang Ming went to find Cheng Feng.

71
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Be careful.

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,950
Why is everything moved out?

73
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
He should have sensed something.

74
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
Cheng Feng,

75
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,600
you rushed to call me back,

76
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
I hope there's good news.

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,630
Otherwise, I might have to punish you.

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
Mr. Smith,

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
the tasks you assigned to me,

80
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,360
I think I can finally report back.

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
Good boy.

82
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,310
Good boy.

83
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,630
Thanks to your guidance.

84
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,070
I knew I didn't misjudge you.

85
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,870
You truly live up to my expectation.

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Good boy.

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,160
I'll make some arrangements tonight.

88
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,750
Let's celebrate properly.

89
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
(Cheng Feng solved the robbery case.)

90
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,300
(Yang Ming is the main mastermind.)

91
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,190
(Isn't this all still mine?)

92
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,920
(The survival of the fittest.)

93
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,680
(Don't blame me.)

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,390
(Everyone's hands are tied.)

95
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,550
(Then let Yang Ming be the scapegoat.)

96
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,750
(I just took)

97
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,480
(what belongs to me.)

98
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
(Is it wrong?)

99
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,030
(In the end, it's still me who laughs last.)

100
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,200
Yang Ming is dead.

101
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,800
Are you sure?

102
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,870
I'm sure.
