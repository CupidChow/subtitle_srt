14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,250
How could you return so abruptly

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,480
without even giving advance notice?

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,870
I don't like surprises.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,430
If I had notified you in advance,

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,200
wouldn't I have missed this great show?

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,790
Who is she?

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,870
Someone who always wants him dead.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
I can prove it.

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,840
You two have already reached that point

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
behind my back.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
If you don't believe it,

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
I can try again.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,240
No need for that.

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,840
Seriously, she really wants my life.

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,840
I also want your life right now.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,790
Yan Liang,

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,120
although we agreed to have our own fun

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,480
after getting married,

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,230
you promised me

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,920
that you wouldn't bring women home.

34
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,430
I don't care about your family matters,

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
but

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,510
if you have a plan to become a widow,

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,590
I can consider participating in it.

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,150
It seems I am destined

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,430
to be killed by women.

40
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,350
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,350
Mr. Yan!

42
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,920
Mr. Yan, bad news.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,480
You came at the right time.

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,870
Explain it to them.

45
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,120
There is something urgent at the company.

46
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,560
Your target is me.

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
Don't get innocent people involved.

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,800
She is really dangerous.

49
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
Don't provoke her.

50
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,460
(Warehouse)

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,680
These are the opium found from the Chamber.

52
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,080
Send them all to the Patrol Station.

53
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,870
Just consider it as eliminating harm.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,750
The Station has started to conduct

55
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,200
a thorough investigation on the Gang.

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,870
If we hadn't searched them out in time

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,080
and been caught by the Station,

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,310
we wouldn't get away with it.

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,310
Mr. Yang,

60
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,000
during the time I've been away,

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
why did those guys

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,710
get into the business of selling opium?

63
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,750
You should give me an explanation, huh?

64
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,750
Mr. Yan,

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
those guys getting into trouble

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,030
are those who can't afford enough to eat.

67
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,680
You know what the market is like now.

68
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,150
Business is hard to do.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,430
The dock business

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,520
has almost been swallowed up by the Gang.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,150
Those veteran staff in the Chamber

72
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,400
have quite a lot of opinions about you.

73
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,120
I still remember you say

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,430
that if we can't get enough to eat,

75
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
we can be self-reliant.

76
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,470
I let you be self-reliant,

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,480
but I didn't ask you to do immoral things.

78
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,600
Being left behind means being eliminated.

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
What's more,

80
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,630
if anyone has objections,

81
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,950
ask them to talk to me.

82
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,710
Do you understand?

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Understood.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
Mrs. Yan?

85
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,470
What brings you here?

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
Mr. Yan is upstairs. I take you there.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Shh.

88
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,710
Yang Ming,

89
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,190
you have been with him the longest, right?

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,350
That's right.

91
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,200
Don't you think

92
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,870
he has been acting strange lately?

93
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,070
What do you mean by that?

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,800
When he came back this time,

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,430
I felt

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,040
his behavior and way of doing things

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,120
were completely different.

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,560
Considering what you said,

99
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,360
I also find it a bit strange.

100
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,000
Mr. Yan has disappeared for half a year.

101
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,160
He suddenly reappeared this time.

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
Indeed, he's completely different.

103
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,720
Could it be that something

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
made him become like this?

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,160
You're really standing up for him.

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,600
If it weren't for me back then,

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,920
can he get this far today?

108
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,510
What an ungrateful man!

109
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,390
In the past when I came back,

110
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
he put on a show at least.

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
Now he doesn't even want to touch me.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
Has he changed his heart?

113
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,600
He must have some issues.

114
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,800
The key is that I'm so beautiful.

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Yang Ming, tell me

116
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,230
if I am beautiful.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
Am I beautiful?

118
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
Of course.

119
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,360
How could you not be beautiful?

120
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,040
These words such as gorgeous

121
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,270
and stunning

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,560
are used to describe you.

123
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,230
Get to the point.

124
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,750
Get to the point...

125
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,440
Ok.

126
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,430
Then I say it directly.

127
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,040
Mrs. Yan, I also feel

128
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,630
that Mr. Yan has issues.

129
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,510
The only person who knows him well

130
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,800
in this world is you.

131
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,920
In other words,

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,750
are there any special scars

133
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,720
or any birthmarks

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,310
on Mr. Yan's body?

135
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,390
You should know best.

136
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,390
Find an opportunity to check.

137
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,360
Then you can dispel your worries.

138
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,070
Do you mean

139
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,270
that the current president is fake?

140
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,870
You are right.

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
During the conflict a few years ago,

142
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,390
he had several gunshot wounds and scars.

143
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,070
I will find a chance to check it.

144
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,190
You're back.

145
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,670
What's wrong?

146
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,480
Miss Bai is not here.

147
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,190
You are disappointed.

148
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,550
You must be kidding.

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Miss Bai and I are just acquaintances.

150
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,600
You are the most important one in my heart.

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,040
Good.

152
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,480
I want to see

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,910
whether I am important in your heart,

154
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,960
or if you forget your old love

155
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,600
once you have a new one.

156
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,120
No one can replace you

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,030
in my heart.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm not that easily deceived woman.

159
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,510
Honey,

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,960
the water is ready.

161
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,480
Let me help you take your clothes off.

162
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,200
Honey, I recently caught a cold.

163
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,120
The doctor said I shouldn't get chilled.

164
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,630
We must listen to the doctor's advice.

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,270
The doctor doesn't know you well like I do.

166
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,200
Why do you smell different

167
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,790
when you come back this time?

168
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,360
The fragrance you wear is different now.

169
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,960
You pick up someone else's scent, right?

170
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,080
You can't keep getting jealous

171
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,670
and suspecting me of cheating

172
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,910
just because a woman came to our house.

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,790
Jealous?

174
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,840
Where am I not as good as her?

175
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,630
I just want her to see

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,000
who is the hostess of this house.

177
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,320
It must be you.

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,040
I promise.

179
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,000
Then you must behave well.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
All right.
