=I Anticipate Your Anticipation=

14
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,350
Mr. Yang,

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,840
it seems you are much concerned

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,320
about our married life.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,280
Mr. Yan, don't get me wrong.

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,430
These days

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
the Prince's Gang has been trying

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,640
to trouble the Chamber of Commerce.

21
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,480
To protect the safety of you,

22
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,230
I brought these guys here

23
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,350
for defense.

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
You have been more and more careful

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,870
in your work lately.

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,400
Does Chen Chuang think

27
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,680
that clinging to Cheng Feng

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,920
can make him have no worries?

29
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,000
Speaking of Cheng Feng,

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
he really has some guts.

31
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,910
Our guys said

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,280
that he dared to collude

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,870
with the Prince's Gang to sell opium.

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,280
Continue to keep an eye on them.

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,030
What's more,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
I want Chen Chuang to disappear.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
That batch of opium should disappear too.

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,870
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,560
Then I won't disturb you.

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Let's go.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Where are we going?

42
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,190
That day when we were fighting,

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
I accidentally damaged your clothes.

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
I

45
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,630
dislike owing others anything the most.

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,030
I happen to have time today.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll take you to go shopping.

48
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,030
Do you think that by doing this,

49
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,710
I will give up on killing you?

50
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,400
If you let your guard down, I'll kill you.

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
Ok.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
Wait a moment.

53
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,310
Where are you going?

54
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,840
You take another woman out but not me.

55
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,870
Isn't this bias?

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,910
I didn't mean that.

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,000
We can't let Miss Bai become a third wheel.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,840
It's uncertain who the third wheel is.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Let's go.

60
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,160
Welcome, welcome!

61
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,340
Please take good care of the two ladies.

62
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,350
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,040
I don't want him.

64
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,800
I want you to choose for me.

65
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,110
I want you too.

66
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,470
Ok.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
I serve both of you.

68
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,910
Yan Liang.

69
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
Yan Liang.

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
Yan Liang.

71
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,950
Yan Liang.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,270
Come over and help me.

73
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,480
What are you afraid of?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,950
Mr. Yan,

75
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,830
can you help me pull up the zipper?

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,320
What's wrong?

77
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,510
Are you embarrassed?

78
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,790
No.

79
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,350
I will go out first.

80
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,350
Where is she?

81
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,040
White Peony won't run away, will she?

82
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
What's wrong with you?

83
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,800
You didn't even have breakfast.

84
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,360
What does it have to do with you?

85
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,360
You have to be full to fight me.

86
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,510
Otherwise, it's unfair for me to win, right?

87
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
I am not interested in Yan Liang.

88
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,920
I am only interested

89
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,190
in his life.

90
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I have said

91
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,310
everything in this house belongs to me,

92
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,750
including Yan Liang.

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,720
If I don't let you hurt him,

94
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,430
do you think you have a chance?

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,390
Then keep an eye on him at all times.

96
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
Don't let me find an opportunity.

97
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,120
In other words,

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,360
he doesn't want me to leave.

99
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,870
I have no way out.

100
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,920
Since you don't belong here,

101
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,360
then I'll help you disappear.

102
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,150
As I wish.

103
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,160
Miss Bai,

104
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,560
I hope you can follow your heart.

105
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,720
Don't let me see you again.

106
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,870
Wish us good luck.

107
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Wish us good luck.

108
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,440
It's uncertain who the third wheel is.

109
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,870
Excuse me.

110
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,750
Go. That way.
