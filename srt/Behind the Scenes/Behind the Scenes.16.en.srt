00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
and become...

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,400

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,600
Don't talk nonsense.

18
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,790
If you keep talking nonsense,

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
I'll stab you.

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,320
I really stab you.

21
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,040
I really stab you.

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,590
Let me help you sew a button.

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,550
This one.

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,430
- Let me help you.
- No need.

25
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,310
I'll sew it for you.

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,640
- Please wait a moment.
- Come on.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,840
I'll sew it for you.

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
No need.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
- Come on.
- Cheng Ru.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,870
- You really can't go in.
- Yan Liang.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
Mr. Cheng,

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,240
you don't consider yourself an outsider.

33
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,500
(Arrest Warrant)

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Again.

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,680
The trick is a bit clichéd,

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,280
but it never fails to work.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Go ahead.

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Is there anything new?

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,080
We suspect

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
you're related to the bank robbery case

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,560
and arrest you according to the law.

42
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,530
Please cooperate with our investigation.

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,710
Let's go.

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,750
Where is the evidence?

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,030
Yang Ming is your personal secretary.

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,430
Isn't that enough?

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,470
And he has already confessed everything.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
What?

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
Do I need

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,120
to explain in more detail?

51
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,710
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Help me sew it up.

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Wait for me to come back.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,200
Let's go.

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,060
(Order for Discharge)

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,030
Let him go like that?

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,190
This is a military order.

58
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,800
I am helpless.

59
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Stay calm.

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,830
Mr. Yan, please have a seat.

61
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,700
(Yamada
President of the Japan Chamber)

62
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,070
Long time no see, Mr. Yan.

63
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
Mr. Yamada,

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,510
thank you for your rescue again.

65
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,910
However,

66
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,040
feel free to speak your mind.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,120
Aren't you Chinese people

68
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,270
claiming to be a nation of etiquette?

69
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,600
I made an exception and saved you twice.

70
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,830
Mr. Yan,

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,560
shouldn't you show some courtesy?

72
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,670
Courtesy?

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,270
Why not deal with those fake money?

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,870
After the shootout with the police,

75
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,190
80 million has vanished without a trace.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,040
I have also been searching.

77
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,590
You

78
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,240
promised me to rob the bank,

79
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,680
so that your position can be saved.

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,510
This is the promise you made to me?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,120
We are all smart people.

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,560
I'll get straight to the point.

83
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,950
The bank lost 80 million.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
They will soon find

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,950
the money that was recovered is fake.

86
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,390
At my place,

87
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,800
there is a batch of goods worth 80 million.

88
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,310
But the name on the bill is interesting.

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Yamada.

90
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,240
How could such a coincidence happen?

91
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,160
Seems that nothing can be hidden from you.

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Mr. Yamada,

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,950
are you planning to use the goods

94
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,510
to deal with us Chinese?

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,510
If I die today,

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,000
don't ever think you can get

97
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,070
that batch of goods in my hands.

98
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,230
Ru,

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,520
I want to talk to you.

100
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
- Why do you...
- Why do you...

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,200
You speak first.

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
I know you're wondering why,

103
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,750
why I left with Yan Liang.

104
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,720
It's because I can't let go of my dad.

105
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,600
He died without a clear reason.

106
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,750
During the time I spent with you,

107
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,360
I dreamed of him every day.

108
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,720
In my dream,

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
he always shouts something at me.

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
But I...

111
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,270
I can't hear anything.

112
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
That's because you miss him too much.

113
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
Ru,

114
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,510
I have already caught the murderer.

115
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,590
I came here today

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
to tell you this matter.

117
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,040
You don't have to lurk beside Yan Liang.

118
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,920
But the murderer is Yan Liang.

119
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
You said that.

120
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,030
Yes.

121
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,390
I was afraid you would act rashly,

122
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,950
so I came up this plan.

123
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,920
It's wrong for me to deceive you.

124
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,360
But thing about it.

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,240
The person I caught is Yang Ming.

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,600
He is Yan Liang's personal secretary.

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,270
I have no evidence to prove

128
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,160
everything was instigated by Yan Liang.

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,310
But Yan Liang is not a good person.

130
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,600
Stay away from him.

131
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,060
Have you finished speaking?

132
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,200
Ru,

133
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,510
leave the master's matters to me.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Go home with me, ok?

135
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,910
Cheng Feng,

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,750
I hope you understand

137
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,480
we can't go back.

138
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
Look at the time.

139
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,840
Why are you back so late?

140
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,750
Where on earth have you been?

141
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you know I'm worried about you?

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
I don't know why,

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,750
but for a moment today,

144
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,390
I thought I would never see you again.

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,870
Mr. Cheng,

146
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,080
you seem to have something on your mind.

147
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,630
Did something happen?

148
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,910
I was just thinking about Yan Liang.

149
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,910
Thinking of the other man in my arms.

150
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,200
Is there some kind of special hobby?

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,550
I am just frustrated.

152
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,670
The Japanese are always helping Yan Liang.

153
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,670
With my position,

154
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,670
it's hard to take action against him.

155
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,480
Cooperation is temporary,

156
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,510
but interests are eternal.

157
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,550
Yan Liang has been very cautious these years,

158
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,120
still hoping to give up the old business.

159
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,440
Do you think the Japanese will agree?

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,720
Yan Liang has their handle in his hands,

161
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,440
so they dare not touch him.

162
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,120
I advise you

163
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,030
to check it out.

164
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,440
After all, the enemy of my enemy

165
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,510
is my friend.

166
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,030
You are so smart.

167
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,390
Losing you

168
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,440
is truly a great loss in his life.

169
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,600
So you took advantage of it.

170
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Why not deal with those fake money?

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,100

At my place,

172
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,030

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,440

174
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240

(Yamada's real purpose)

177
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,910
(was to rob the batch of fake money.)

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
(But in order to deceive others,)

179
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
(he made everyone believe)

180
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,910
(that the 80 million stolen was real.)

181
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,840
(Actually, he had swapped it out)

182
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,670
(and took that money to buy that goods.)

183
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,000
