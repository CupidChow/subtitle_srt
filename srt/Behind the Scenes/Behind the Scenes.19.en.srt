15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
Mrs. Yan,

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,630
hope you are very well.

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
You have not treated me poorly.

18
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,560
Now, I will present all the truth

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,680
that I know.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,950
When the bank robbery occurred,

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
I was at the scene.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,790
I have also witnessed everything.

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,790
That day, Mr. Yan fell into the river.

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,430
And the shooter

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,560
is Cheng Feng, the current Inspector.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
Mrs. Yan,

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,510
your suspicion about Yan Liang

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,560
has always been correct.

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,280
He probably never told you

30
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,920
that he has a twin brother.

31
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,950
I have found out

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,350
his name is Yan An.

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,710
He had been studying abroad.

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,680
Later, he smuggled back to the country.

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,080
This Yan Liang is no longer the same one.

36
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,840
You must be careful.

37
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,470
Do not be negligent.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Yan Liang.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
Yan Liang, let go of me.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,630
Let go, Yan Liang.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,150
Put me down.

42
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,150
Yan Liang.

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,240
How many things are you hiding from me?

44
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,710
I promised

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,430
that I won't hurt you

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
and I won't deceive you either.

47
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,310
So,

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,030
I hope you can believe me

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,280
about what I am about to say next.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
But I have already seen the evidence

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
of your collusion with the Japanese.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,200
You once said

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,590
evidence never lies.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
If you don't believe me,

55
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,430
you can ask it.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,190
If I lie, you can shoot me.

57
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Ok.

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,310
Have you ever colluded with the Japanese?

59
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,470
No.

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,460
Is there a direct connection

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,560
between you and my father's death?

62
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,430
No.

63
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,350
Do you know how my father

64
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,560
actually died?

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,020
There is not enough evidence right now,

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
but I will give you the answer.

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,160
So why are you doing this?

68
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,910
Because of you.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,190
I don't want to involve you in the dispute.

70
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm afraid you will be in danger.
