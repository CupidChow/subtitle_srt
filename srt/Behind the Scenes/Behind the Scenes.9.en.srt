stop right there.

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,400
He has left you again.

But this matter that you were kidnapped

25

Mr. Yang,

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
I heard you recently purchased a property.

67
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,390
No wonder you're looking glowing.

68
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,000
Our company has not been doing well lately.

69
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,000
Is the salary enough?

70
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,270
How about cooperating with the Gang again

and buy more opium?

72
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Well...

73
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,240
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,800
I don't quite understand.

75
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
It's normal to have two sets of accounts.

76
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,430

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,800

79
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,270
Mr. Yang,

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,070
you are a smart person.

81
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,790
You should

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,950
make sure to clean up the mess properly.

83
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,790
Mrs. Yan, don't worry.

84
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,220
There will definitely not be a next time.
