14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,400
What's wrong?

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,560
You look

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,790
unhappy today.

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,950
Mr. Yan, may I ask

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,350
what we are going to do?

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,350
You'll find out in a bit.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Let's go.

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,150
Let's go.

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,350
So annoying.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,840
Your suit has long been made.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,950
Mrs. Yan's wedding dress

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,760
took some time.

26
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,710
Look.

27
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,950
The patterns on it

28
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,230
were specially embroidered

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,560
stitch by stitch by an embroiderer.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
And its style

31
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,150
was designed as per Mr. Yan's request.

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Mrs. Yan,

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,150
Mr. Yan really cares about you.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,470
No need to mention such trivial matters.

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,000
Mrs. Yan, why don't you give it a try?

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,910
Who is Mrs. Yan?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Mr. Yan,

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,400
I wonder why you took me here.

39
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,910
Xiaohua told me

40
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,710
women all love wedding dresses.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
But I don't know...

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Go.

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,200
Go.

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Be careful.

45
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,790
Are you ok?

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,030
I'm fine.

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,390
How dare you deceive me with fake money?

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,800
Do you really think I'm a fool?

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,870
Cheng Feng.

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,390
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

51
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,560
I was also deceived by them.

52
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't care what method you use,

53
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,680
you have to get the money back.

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
If you can't,

55
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,390
just find a way to compensate me.

56
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,600
Remember?

57
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Remember?

58
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,590
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,790
It hurts a little.

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Bear with it.

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
How many people have you offended?

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Why do so many people want to kill you?

63
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,270
Basked on the skills of that group of people,

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,310
they should not be ordinary people.

65
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,710
In this way,

66
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,950
we are closer to the truth.

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,510
Do you mean

68
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,390
the mastermind behind the robbery case

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,040
has already set his sights on us?

70
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,110
It's possible.

71
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
The closer we get to the truth,

72
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,240
the more dangerous it becomes.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,840
Aren't you afraid?

74
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,040
If you're not afraid, why should I be?

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Don't forget

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,750
your life is mine.

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Hold on.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,840
Don't look.

79
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,790
I'm not in the mood today.

80
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,560
What happened?

81
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,310
Who bullied you?

82
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,030
None of your business.

83
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,190
Let me tell you some good news.

84
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,510
I guarantee you'll feel refreshed and relaxed

85
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,920
after hearing it.

86
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
What?

87
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,920
The Japanese took action against them.

88
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
Take action?

89
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,910
What about Cheng Ru?

90
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,270
She

91
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
put herself forward

92
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,920
and saved your rival in love.

93
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,950
Have you confirmed their deaths?

94
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,950
They are living well.

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
You still care about her quite a bit.

96
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,950
I didn't mean it that way.

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,240
I am worried if she and her father

98
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,390
all died tragically beside me,

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
others may...

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,750
A lion doesn't care

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,510
how a rabbit curses it.

102
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,150
Cheng Feng,

103
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,630
they are now our common enemy.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
You need to understand this point clearly.

105
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,720
One must be ruthless to stand firm.

106
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
Cheng Feng,

107
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,000
you still haven't made any progress.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
Thank you for your time.

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
Mr. Yamada...

110
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,510
Mr. Cheng,

111
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,240
you must be busier than me lately, right?

112
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,750
I wonder what brings you

113
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,240
to my place this time.

114
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,750
I'd like to discuss a collaboration with you.
