00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,910
Mr. Yan,

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,280
documents from Yang Ming's office show

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,280
that a batch of goods in the Yongli warehouse

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,680
has remained undelivered for half a year.

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,790
Strangely,

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,230
overdue warehouse rental fees

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,400
has always been paid by someone.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,640
(Goods Registration Form)

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,870
Is there any problem with the goods?

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,870
The goods is registered as fruit.

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,710
Fruits?

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,090
What fruit can be stored for half a year?

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,230
We were also thinking like this.

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,000
When we handled them,

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
we found there was no unusual smell.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,120
Who is the holder of the goods?

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
This is even more strange.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,760
This company

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,510
is registered as a Japanese shell company.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,710
You don't need to know who I am.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,790
The superiors sent me to save you.

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,590
Has anyone handled with the goods?

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
No.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,000
Apply to the railway bureau and customs.

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,880
I want to inspect the goods.

43
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,910
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Hurry up.

48
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,310
Coming.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,710
So infuriating.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,640
Well...

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Come on. Be careful.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Move the one next room later.

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Ok.

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,310
Mrs. Yan, what are you doing?

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Mr. Yan will scold me.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,260
Everything is going wrong.

57
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,470
I get rid of bad luck. What's wrong?

58
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,030
Mrs. Yan...

59
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,030
Yan Liang, the bed downstairs...

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Bed?

61
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,470
Your bed is also gone?

62
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,470
Lisha even moved the sofa away.

63
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,430
I'll go find Lisha.

64
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,430
I just looked for her.

65
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,520
She is not in the mansion.

66
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,910
The bed is gone.

67
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
How about

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,710
going to the hotel?

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
What are you saying?

70
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
I said

71
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,150
we

72
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,040
book two rooms and sleep separately.

73
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,190
What are you thinking about?

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
Forget it. Let's make do with it.

75
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,270
Dad...

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
Dad, don't go...

77
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,040
Dad, don't go...

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
Don't leave me.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Dad, don't go.

80
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,670
Dad...

81
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,590
Dad...

82
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,790
Dad...

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
It's ok.

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Dad!

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I won't leave.

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,520
I'm here.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,870
I will be with you forever.

88
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,590
I won't leave.

89
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,910
I won't leave.

90
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,390
I'm happy today. I want the good wine.

91
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,640
All right, sir.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,950
This drink is on me today.

93
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,120
Mr. Cheng,

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,160
the death of Yang Ming

95
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,120
seems to make you very happy.

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Survival of the fittest.

97
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,000
The weak are consumed by the strong.

98
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,430
Isn't that how it should be?

99
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,240
Who do you say is weak?

100
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,830
Don't be angry, Miss Lisha.

101
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,950
Not until the end,

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,390
everything is still uncertain.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,360
By the last moment,

104
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,800
we may destroy everyone together.

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,510
