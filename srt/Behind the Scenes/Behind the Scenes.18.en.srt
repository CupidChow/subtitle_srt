Mr. Cheng,

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,710
you must be busier than I am lately, right?

43
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,150
I wonder what brings you

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,270
a collaboration with you.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,630
Mr. Cheng,

48
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,750
I am just a businessman.

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm afraid I can't help you.

The 80 million bank robbery case,

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,080
I wonder if you has heard of it.

52
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,840
A little.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
But this matter

54
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,030
has nothing to do with me.

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,800
Mr. Yamada, as a shareholder of the bank,

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,470
you are a victim too, right?

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,310
Or

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,800
you instructed Yan Liang to rob the bank?

59
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,190
What made you think

60
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,630
your arbitrary subjective speculation

61
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,870
as a Chinese person

62
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,360
can undermine the friendship

63
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,120
between us Japanese and the French?

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I can't.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,190
But 80 million can.

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,950
Yan Liang, who hasn't been killed, also can.

67
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,040
Tell me about your conditions.

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Money.

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
I want that missing 80 million.

70
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,310
Ok, then I want the goods.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,920
I have a batch of goods at Yan Liang's place.

72
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,070
Help me bring them over.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,840
No problem.

74
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,270
You are so capable.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,870
Why must you work under the French?

76
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,950
It would be better to follow me.

77
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,870
Let me first submit my letter of loyalty.

78
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
You are awake.

79
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,150
Do you remember

80
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
when you first came to find me,

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,950
I played this piece.

82
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,920
Of course I remember.

83
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,680
I just didn't expect you to remember it.

84
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,580
What you like is the most important.

85
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Here.

86
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Thank you, Yan Liang.

87
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,800
Thank you for taking care of me.

88
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,360
I should thank you.

89
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,270
You saved me.

90
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,070
But I have conditions.

91
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
What conditions?

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,750
From now on, no matter what happens,

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,870
you must not lie to me.

94
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
Ok.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
I promise you.

96
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,430

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
How are you now?

103
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm fine now.

104
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,070
Thank you for your concern.

105
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,600
After so many years of our relationship,

106
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,030
there's no need to be so cold.

107
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,870
It's all just a matter of mutual choice.

108
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,600
Your choice

109
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,510
is really him, isn't it?

110
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,000
Have you ever thought

111
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,200
about what would happen to you if he knew

112
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,720
you intentionally got close to him?

113
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,870
That's a matter between him and me.

114
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,670
You don't have to worry about it.

115
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,360
Seems you are really out of your mind.

116
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,550
Why don't you ask the Japanese

117
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,480
why he colluded with them?

118
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Impossible.

119
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,960
He is not that kind of person.

120
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,870
Ru,

121
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,550
don't be silly.

122
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
If I didn't have enough evidence,

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,870
I wouldn't be telling you this.

124
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,550
What made you think

125
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
I would believe you now?

126
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,270
These are transport agreements signed

127

128
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,800
You take a good look.

129
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,480
You can choose not to believe me.

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
But I also advise you

131
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,550
not to trust him too much.
