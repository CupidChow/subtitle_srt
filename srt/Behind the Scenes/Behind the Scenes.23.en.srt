=The Most Unlikely Killer=

14
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,430
Did you kill my brother?

15
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,760
You just didn't expect

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,710
the money you worked so hard to recover

17
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,870
turned out to be fake.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,350
Yamada made you a huge joke.

19
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,610
The feeling of being fooled is not good, huh?

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,350
That's right.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,760
I killed your brother, so what?

22
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,760
I still remember his eyes before he died.

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,920
Full of desire to survive.

24
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,430
I think before he died,

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,230
he must have thought of you.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Mr. Cheng,

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,870
you've done so many bad things.

28
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,590
It must not feel good to stand alone.

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,840
Do you find it hard to sleep every day?

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Mr. Yan, it's

31
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,590
not your place to teach me how to do things.

32
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,000
I forgot to tell you.

33
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,360
Cheng Ru is also in my hands.

34
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,030
In the end,

35
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,080
you didn't get anything.

36
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,520
Yan An. Yan An.

37
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
Yan An.

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
Yan An, where are you?

39
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,350
Yan An.

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,830
Cheng Feng, what are you doing?

41
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Yan An,

42
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,310
Cheng Ru is in my hands.

43
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,790
Yan An.

44
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,240
Come at me.

45
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,670
Don't hurt her.

46
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,470
Yan An!

47
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,830
You're on the brink of death,

48
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
yet you're pretending to be affectionate.

49
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,560
Ridiculous!

50
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,240
Didn't I let you go?

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Why did you come back?

52
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,630
If something happens to you,

53
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,470
what should I do?

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,630
Do you think by sending me away,

55
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,070
you bear all this alone,

56
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,390
I can live in peace?

57
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Come on, you guys,

58
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,720
why do you have to force me

59
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,310
make the scene so embarrassing?

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
The three of us

61
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,720
obviously can live peacefully.

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Cheng Feng,

63
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,870
are you worthy of me,

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
are you worthy of your master?

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Are you worthy of yourself?

66
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,390
Worthy of him?

67
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,870
You ask him if he is worthy of me.

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
I've been adopted by your family.

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,630
To say it nicely,

70
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm the adopted son.

71
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,310
To say it bluntly,

72
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm just one of your dogs.

73
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,670
You...

74
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,430
I also need to take good care of you.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
What about him?

76
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,070
He forcefully imposed his wish

77
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,160
for my success on me,

78
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,000
making me a lackey for the foreigners.

79
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,040
Inspector?

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't care!

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Cheng Feng,

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,240
did you really kill my dad?

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
No,

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,070
it's all his fault.

85
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,750
He is too much of an obstruction,

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,160
blocking my road to success.

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Master.

88
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,710
Master.

89
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,670
Master,

90
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,710
how are you?

91
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,160
Be sure to catch the robbers.

92
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,240
Sorry, Master.

93
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,070
You must die today.

94
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,000
Yan An. Yan An, are you ok?

95
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,480
Ru, be away from him.

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,430
We can start it over.

97
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,510
Otherwise, don't blame me.

98
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,390
You are daydreaming.

99
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,830
Starting today,

100
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,070
I have a mortal enmity with you.

101
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,270
Why don't kill me together?

102
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,230
Fine.

103
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,920
I let you die together.

104
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
Yan An...

105
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,590
Yan An...
