(Warehouse)

Search!

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,990
Stop.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,310
What

20
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,310
brought you here, Mr. Cheng?

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Mr. Yan,

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
we received a report,

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,470
saying the Japanese lost a batch of goods.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,710
According to the informant,

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,240
the goods seem to be related with you.

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,150
So what exactly are the goods?

27
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,400
Did the informant explain it carefully?

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,240
If everyone in this concession

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
claims to have lost something

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,870
and blames it on the Chamber,

31
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,400
and you, as the police, act on hearsay,

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,750
isn't it a bit disrespectful to us?

33
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,030
Don't pretend, Mr. Yan.

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
I know Yamada's goods

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
are right here.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Delivering

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,870
is good for both of us.

38
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,630
Have your investigations

39
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,470
become so crude and despicable now?

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,960
As long as it is useful.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,710
Mr. Yan,

42
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,750
go with me.

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,280
Don't make me get rough.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,020
(Warehouse)

45
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,310
Mr. Yamada.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,750
Mr. Cheng, have some tea.

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,640
No need.

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,750
Mr. Yamada,

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
I visited today

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,630
to let you know

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,560
that I found the goods

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
you asked me to find.

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,270
Moreover,

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,120
I also prepared a great gift for you.

55
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,150
I think

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,310
you'll love it.

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,240
Mr. Cheng,

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
you are indeed exceptionally talented

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,030
and outstanding.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
This way.

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Mr. Yamada,

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
it's not good to bring so many people in.

63
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,960
Too many eyes

64
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,000
might ruin your big plans.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,470
Mr. Cheng, it makes sense.

66
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,080
The rest of you guard at the door.

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,590
Don't come in without my orders.

68
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,590
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,150
Mr. Yamada,

70
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,710
please.

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,270
Great!

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
So great!

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,720
Mr. Cheng,

74
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,830
you truly are the most outstanding inspector.

75
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,510
Turns out that the gift you mentioned

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,630
is Mr. Yan.

77
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,240
Well done. Well done.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Mr. Yamada,

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
your goods.

80
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,270
Mr. Yamada, if there are no objections,

81
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,240
please keep our promises.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,070
I'll hand over the rest of the arms.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Looks like you still don't trust me.

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
Today's world is dangerous.

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,370
Everyone puts themselves at risk.

86
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,920
We work in the Patrol Station

87
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,800
and have to leave a way out for ourselves.

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,920
I understand that you act carefully.

89
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,830
But I'm a businessman.

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,630
Chinese people value integrity the most.

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,190
You understand this principle, huh?

92
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,800
Yamada,

93
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,920
have you heard of the two words in China,

94
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,830
called 'deception

95
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,480
and scheming'?

96
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to give it to you and Cheng Feng.

97
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,120
I think it's just right.

98
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,160
Yan Liang,

99
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,230
you

100
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,920
should learn from Mr. Cheng

101
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,870
what is the ability to get things done.

102
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,510
How could such a simple task

103
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,950
lead to such a big oversight?

104
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,870
Now I have to clean up after you.

105
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,310
I'm afraid that will disappoint you.

106
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,190
Yan Liang is dead.

107
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,600
My name is Yan An.

108
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,590
By the way,

109
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,720
my brother told me in my dream

110
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,240
that he missed you

111
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,390
and he wished to see you sooner.

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
Yan An?

113
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,470
Yan Liang?

114
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,630
Why are you guys so alike?

115
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,510
Was it you who acted before?

116
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
Yes.

117
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm surprised too.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
How did he fool everyone?

119
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,640
However,

120
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,240
he finally fell into my hands.

121
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,910
Yamada,

122
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,920
you've really done a good business,

123
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
using other people's money to sell arms,

124
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,870
doing such morally reprehensible things,

125
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,360
and yet you speak with sincerity.

126
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,680
That's ridiculous.

127
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,710
Yan Liang,

128
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,510
how could you make such a mistake?

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
Mr. Yan,

130
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,310
you should see the situation clearly.

131
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,560
Good birds choose their trees to roost.

132
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,390
Only in chaotic times can heroes emerge.

133
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,920
I don't care who you are.

134
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,310
Mr. Cheng, kill him.

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,630
Then hand over the remaining arms to me.

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,430
I will take care of the pressure

137
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,800
from Smith for you.

138
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,050
And,

139
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,910
next month,

140
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,270
I can promote you to be the Supervisor.

141
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,070
What do you think,

142
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
Supervisor Cheng?

143
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Inspector Cheng,

144
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
no,

145
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,390
Supervisor Cheng,

146
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,710
just do it.

147
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Kill him.

148
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,080
When he dies, you will have everything.
