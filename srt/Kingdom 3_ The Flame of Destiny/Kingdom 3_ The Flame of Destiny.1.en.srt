1
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,665
Your Majesty, is something the matter?

2
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,544
It's nothing.

3
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,215
What is it?

4
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,554
We've finally found out
the whereabouts of that big shot.

5
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,598
Big shot?

6
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,893
Shin?

7
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,186
Yes.

8
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,108
He's been missing for the past six months.

9
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,903
It turns out he'd been training
under Ohki.

10
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,240
Training? Under Ohki?

11
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,243
That's right, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,705
But Ohki put Shin in a stateless zone

13
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,292
and left him there to restore order
on his own.

14
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,632
The last place in the plains
where the lost tribes end up.

15
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,973
The killings continue,
fighting each other over trivial domains.

16
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,559
A crazy lawless zone.

17
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,019
A task to restore order.

18
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:31,609
Ohki's test for Shin
to become a 100-man commander.

19
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,864
If he's still alive, that is.

20
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,118
He's alive.

21
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,957
He'll come back and appear before us
bigger than ever.

22
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,768
En.

23
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,563
We did it.

24
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,689
Sure did.

25
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,486
We've restored order in the crazy plains!

26
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,548
The Warring States Period.

27
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,597
Seven states were at war
on the great continent for 500 years.

28
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,020
After his first battle at Dakan Plains,

29
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,191
Shin asked Ohki to train him
so he could become a great general.

30
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,114
In response, Ohki gave Shin
an ordeal to overcome.

31
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,247
A test to restore order in the plains
where there was endless tribal conflict.

32
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,834
Shin backed up the weakest tribe.

33
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:19,300
Gaining their trust, his troops
finally restored order in the plains.

34
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,698
Now that Shin was ready,

35
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,702
Ohki promised to take him in for training.

36
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,666
At that very moment,
near the border of Qin,

37
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:56,546
a bigger threat than the Battle
of Dakan Plains was approaching.

38
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,279
244 B.C.

39
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:26,117
QIN STATE, NORTHWESTERN REGION

40
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,376
BORDER TOWN, KANSUI

41
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,420
Dad, look.

42
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,468
Lots of flags.

43
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:54,979
Enemies.

44
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,566
They're enemies.

45
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,154
The Zhao Army is here!

46
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,489
Hold on tight.

47
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,748
QIN STATE, KING'S CAPITAL, XIANYANG

48
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,792
Zhao broke into our state?

49
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,337
Kansui, the northeastern border town.

50
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,256
There are at least 100,000 men.

51
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,509
So many?

52
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,969
This is bad.

53
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,349
General Hyoko is away
with his army on an expedition to Han.

54
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,310
No troops or generals nearby.

55
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,857
Bring Army Commander Shoheikun here.

56
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:45,571
But, Your Majesty, if we do,
Ryofui and his men will take advantage.

57
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,074
No time for arguments.

58
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:54,330
It's Zhao with a murderous grudge
against us after the Chohei Massacre.

59
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,511
THE COUNCIL ROOM
INSIDE THE ROYAL PALACE

60
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,472
Fifty thousand have surrounded Kansui.

61
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,559
Fifty thousand more are following.

62
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,397
Of all states,
Zhao holds the biggest grudge.

63
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,899
Grudge?

64
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,820
Ten, don't you know about
the Chohei Massacre?

65
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,737
What's that?

66
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,655
STRATEGIST CANDIDATE
AND AIDE OF SHOHEIKUN, MOKI

67
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:33,619
Hakuki, one of the Six Great Generals,
won the Battle of Chohei 16 years ago.

68
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,248
The Zhao troops surrendered.

69
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:42,336
But General Hakuki massacred them
by burying them alive.

70
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,339
Four hundred thousand men.

71
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,425
Four hundred thousand?

72
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,225
Then how come we let Zhao
break in so easily?

73
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,978
Up until now,

74
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,273
we weren't aware of
any generals who could lead big armies.

75
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,609
Generals?

76
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,572
With no general to lead his men,
there would be no armies.

77
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,325
Like our Six Great Generals,

78
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:17,497
Zhao once had the Three Great Heavens
but not anymore.

79
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,291
So, how?

80
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,668
I guess

81
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,797
it means a new general has appeared.

82
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,503
How smooth, Fuki.
You've brought them down already.

83
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,004
CHOSO ARMY'S
ADJUTANT COMMANDER OF ZHAO, FUKI

84
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,215
Let me take the rest.

85
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,009
Do as you please.

86
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,511
Mangoku.

87
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,601
CHOSO ARMY'S
ADJUTANT COMMANDER OF ZHAO, MANGOKU

88
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,473
I shall repay you, Qin!

89
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,657
For what you did to
my people of 400,000 in Chohei.

90
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,629
I am at your service.

91
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,300
Chancellor Ryofui has arrived.

92
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:46,562
How surprising it is
to see Zhao making a move.

93
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:07,708
Times are urgent,
but there is a disorder of precedence.

94
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,714
It'll bring distortion to the battlefield.

95
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,759
Shobunkun.

96
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,678
You're in my place.

97
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,773
Work together now.

98
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,902
Step down.

99
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,840
Urgent message!

100
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,677
Kansui Castle has been taken!

101
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,306
Kansui.

102
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,354
The lord of the castle and its people
were beheaded and left in a blood pool.

103
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,778
Recruit soldiers and form an army at once.

104
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,788
An emergency call is pretty unusual.

105
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,373
There's trouble somewhere.

106
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,291
TERRITORY OF QIN STATE, JOTO VILLAGE

107
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:34,628
Good thing we were here,
the soldiers of the Battle of Dakan.

108
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,756
I have a bad feeling about this.

109
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,050
Stop your whining.

110
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,929
Guys, let's get going.

111
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,514
Bito.

112
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,477
Here.

113
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,149
Wow! A good luck charm.

114
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,068
Come back safely.

115
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,612
I will.

116
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,741
Bihei, your brother beat you to it.

117
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,242
Shut up.

118
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,160
Bihei.

119
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,287
Huh?

120
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,500
Tohbi.

121
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,545
Please come back home safely.

122
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,133
Sure.

123
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,053
I'll make it back bigger than ever.

124
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,528
The Zhao Army is now headed towards Bayo.

125
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,571
How many are in Bayo?

126
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,158
Bayo is a large castle.

127
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,538
There must be approximately
150,000 people altogether.

128
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,292
Your Majesty,
Bayo is the key to our front line.

129
00:13:55,376 --> 00:14:00,297
If it falls to the Zhao Army,
they will penetrate deep into our state.

130
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:08,597
If both Kansui and Bayo fall,
they'll come straight here to Xianyang.

131
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,561
What are our strategists doing?
Still no word from the Council Room?

132
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:22,069
Hundred thousand Zhao Army.
80,000 Qin Army on their way to Bayo.

133
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,823
We're short of 20,000 men.
Won't that be a problem?

134
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,200
It won't matter as much.

135
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,118
I beg to differ.

136
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,122
Their military force is greater.

137
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,460
If the careful King of Zhao made a move,
he must be confident.

138
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,217
At least 100,000 of these men
are most likely to be well trained

139
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:51,473
while our 80,000 men we gathered up
worked as peasants until yesterday.

140
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,476
A big difference in power.

141
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,402
It all depends on the leader
of the Qin Army.

142
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,324
Only the General's ability
can compensate for the difference.

143
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,828
Now that all our generals are away,

144
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,751
it's a blessing in disguise that
you stayed here in Xianyang, Mobu.

145
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,003
Leave it to me.

146
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:31,263
Your Majesty, please appoint Mobu
as commander-in-chief of Qin.

147
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,723
Please do not.

148
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,311
Do I hear a noise from the rear,
Shobunkun?

149
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:43,442
It's not wise to make Mobu
the commander-in-chief.

150
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,742
Want to get killed?

151
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,787
Stop, Mobu.

152
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:01,168
Shobunkun has been a true warrior
since the reign of King Sho.

153
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,921
He's the most experienced here.

154
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,007
Shobunkun.

155
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,219
Share with us your ideas.

156
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,936
There are two kinds of power in warfare.

157
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,479
The offensive

158
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,398
and the defensive.

159
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,736
I take it that Mobu specializes
in offensive skills.

160
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:33,283
When it comes to the offensive,
Mobu may be the best man in Qin.

161
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
But…

162
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,999
I'm afraid I must say
he lacks defensive skills.

163
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,754
This battle is crucial
to the survival of Qin.

164
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,925
Our fate cannot be in your hands.

165
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,388
Old man.

166
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,392
Are those your last words?

167
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,269
Hold your horses, Mobu.

168
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,480
He has a point there.

169
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,607
But Shobunkun.

170
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:11,739
Who else in our state of Qin
can save us from this crisis?

171
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,491
There's one man

172
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,330
who's been away from battle,
resting his wings.

173
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,624
Offensive and defensive.

174
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,963
The best warrior of Qin
who has a combination of both.

175
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,924
The only man.

176
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,802
No.

177
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,888
It can't be.

178
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,778
It's been a while
since things have gotten lively here.

179
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,198
Gentlemen.

180
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,701
How have you been?

181
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,334
Shin.

182
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,103
What is it, Mobu?

183
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,023
You're interrupting the discussion.
Buzz off.

184
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:33,320
But I was summoned here
to participate in the discussion.

185
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,988
Bullshit.

186
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,908
Who in the world would summon you?

187
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,618
I did.

188
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,163
What for?

189
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,417
To offer him the top position.

190
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,174
General Ohki as our commander-in-chief?

191
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,179
Please explain, Shoheikun.

192
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,686
I had already made a request
to General Ohki.

193
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,397
But receiving no answer, I asked Mobu.

194
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,441
Two to choose from.

195
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,027
Which will be the commander-in-chief?

196
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,156
General Ohki, of course.

197
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,869
Expect me to step down so easily?

198
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,370
Shoheikun.

199
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,586
I am your army leader.
My decision will not be overturned.

200
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,089
General Ohki is our commander-in-chief.

201
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:47,144
I will not recognize
a relic of the past like you.

202
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,108
That's too bad because
I recognize your abilities

203
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,444
to a certain degree.

204
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,512
Now, gentlemen, would you mind
stepping out for a moment?

205
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,891
Why is that?

206
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,103
You are now the center of the discussion.

207
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,649
First, I must be appointed

208
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:38,445
as commander-in-chief by the King himself.

209
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,993
Shall we go, Chancellor?

210
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,946
What is it, Ohki?

211
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,741
Why clear the room just to speak to me?

212
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,289
King Sei.

213
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,627
Your great-grandfather, King Sho,
was a great king.

214
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,505
I'm aware of that.

215
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,008
What's unfortunate

216
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,804
is that you haven't had the chance
to see him for yourself.

217
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:52,561
Because you had been taken hostage
by Zhao up until seven years ago.

218
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,316
Hostage?

219
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,193
I suspect

220
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:06,700
no king has ever experienced
such pain and hatred as you.

221
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,993
Ohki.

222
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,996
What's your point?

223
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,294
There's something I'd like to confirm.

224
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:23,592
The reason why
you wish to unify all of China.

225
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,735
I made a promise.

226
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,822
A promise?

227
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,948
That's right.

228
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,576
A promise to someone.

229
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,584
My father, being of royal blood,

230
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:03,215
was taken hostage by the Zhao
enemy state in exchange for a truce.

231
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,009
That was when I was born.

232
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,932
With Ryofui's help,
my father escaped back to Qin

233
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,853
while I was left to rot
in the gutters of Kantan.

234
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,862
ZHAO STATE, KING'S CAPITAL, KANTAN

235
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,491
SEVEN YEARS AGO

236
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,912
After the Chohei Massacre,

237
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,833
all the anger was directed at me,
Qin's royal blood.

238
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,545
While I was in Kantan,

239
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:47,384
I became the target of violence
from every man and woman in the city.

240
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,262
You thief!

241
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,013
Until the day I met her.

242
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,890
Stop!

243
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:08,655
That was the first time
anyone had ever saved me.

244
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,995
Her name was Shika,
a black-market merchant.

245
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,957
Black-market merchant?

246
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:26,798
Since my father escaped to Qin,
I was left to starve.

247
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,801
I lived my life like a slave.

248
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,056
But one day,

249
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,060
my world suddenly turned around.

250
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,148
King Sho passed

251
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,152
and your father was to become king.

252
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:53,325
Which meant that you were
the next heir to the throne.

253
00:24:55,076 --> 00:25:00,123
That's why they had to
bring me back to Qin at all costs,

254
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,668
and a black-market merchant was hired.

255
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:09,257
They're geniuses when it comes to
smuggling goods to other states.

256
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,010
I see.

257
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:18,808
But entrusting an important heir
to a black-market merchant

258
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,729
is a risky plan, don't you think?

259
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,814
There was no time.

260
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,943
The King of Zhao knew

261
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,822
if I were to become king,
that would mean trouble to him.

262
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,370
I had to escape
before he had his men kill me.

263
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:43,875
Why did a black-market merchant agree
to take on such a perilous mission?

264
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,963
I know. It's a wonder.

265
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,074
You have angry eyes.

266
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,743
Don't you like the moon?

267
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,714
I didn't like the moon.

268
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,257
I hated it.

269
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:40,640
When you've hit rock bottom,
it looks brighter than usual.

270
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,061
As if it's laughing at you.

271
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,732
That made me angry.

272
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:57,532
But someone told me
that wasn't true at all.

273
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,872
My father, who found and raised me…

274
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,668
he would say,

275
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,089
"When the moon looks brighter than usual,

276
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,719
it's trying to cheer you up
so you won't be discouraged."

277
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:55,048
Shika, I must thank you for two things.

278
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,722
For saving me and telling me

279
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,684
the secret about the moon.

280
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,939
Thank you.

281
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,652
You're welcome.

282
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,479
I've turned down the job.

283
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,358
No need to risk our lives
for a filthy kid.

284
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,533
Boss! I hope you're not having
second thoughts.

285
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,538
I'm not having second thoughts.

286
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,876
My mind is set.

287
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,738
You again.

288
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,203
No.

289
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,705
Go away!

290
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,874
Wait, Your Highness!

291
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,464
We have come for you.

292
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:03,218
We apologize for
the hardships we've caused.

293
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,515
It's time to return to Qin.
Please come with us.

294
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,060
Qin?

295
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,691
King Sho has passed
and your father is the crown prince.

296
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,028
You are now the heir to the throne.

297
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,995
Please wait. Now's our chance to escape!

298
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,330
No way!

299
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,335
You won't make it out of the city.

300
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,214
Bastard, you just turned us down.

301
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,136
We've decided to take the job.

302
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,223
I, the notorious Shika,

303
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,601
will help His Highness go back to Qin.

304
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:03,361
Shika bribed the guards at each checkpoint

305
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,822
and laid the groundwork.

306
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,494
Where the guards were familiar
with Shika, I hid inside the load.

307
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,706
She was smart with the guards.

308
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,963
Next!

309
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,885
Shika.

310
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,264
Who's the stranger?
Never seen his face before.

311
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,770
We're shorthanded,
so I hired him at the village.

312
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,774
Turns out he's no use.
Can I leave him here?

313
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,526
No, you can't! Go!

314
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,244
We passed the third checkpoint.

315
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,289
There was just one more to go.

316
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,263
He hasn't been eating.

317
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,373
If you don't eat,
you won't make it to Qin.

318
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:47,966
Why would you risk your life
to save a man like me?

319
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,349
Amon and I were war orphans.

320
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:02,188
We were about to starve to death
when a black-market merchant saved us.

321
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:11,406
That's the man I call father,
who told me the secret about the moon.

322
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,874
Amon and I,

323
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:27,171
we'll never forget the warmth
of his hands that reached out to us.

324
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,187
Unfortunately, he died
when I was ten years old.

325
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,986
I cried and told him I hadn't repaid him.

326
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,033
He smiled on his deathbed and said,

327
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,581
"Repay by giving kindness
to the next person in need."

328
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,601
That's why I am reaching out to you now.

329
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,700
Fine. Good to go!

330
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,202
Thanks a lot.

331
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,377
That was our last gate.
Qin's straight ahead of us.

332
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,629
Thanks, Shika.

333
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,925
Thank me when we've finished
delivering him safely.

334
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,434
What is this?

335
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,151
Just testing.

336
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,019
Didn't make a sound.

337
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,231
Your Highness!

338
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,657
Can't move. Pull it out.

339
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,081
How courageous of you
to have endured the pain.

340
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,124
Here.

341
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,171
How could he stay so calm?

342
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,299
We're almost there.

343
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,176
We should be safe now.

344
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,803
Enjoy your rich life, future king.

345
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,183
Who's going to be king?

346
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,406
Who's going to be king?

347
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,828
What is it?

348
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,918
You'll never be king.

349
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,884
-Your Highness!
-We have no time for this.

350
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,010
Leave it to me.

351
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,336
Who's going to be king?

352
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,634
You were abandoned by your parents.

353
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,096
There's not a soul who needs you.

354
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,807
Stop.

355
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,850
There's no place for you in Qin.

356
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,768
Besides,

357
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,689
no one wants a broken king.

358
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,198
Your Highness!

359
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,786
Wait.

360
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,707
Your Highness!

361
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,297
What's the matter? You're almost home.

362
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,339
Go away!

363
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,009
Your Highness!

364
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,138
I can't go back.

365
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,395
There's a reason I can't.

366
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,194
Don't.

367
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,246
I don't feel pain.

368
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,334
Not just that.

369
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,755
There's no taste, no smell.

370
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,509
I don't feel hot or cold at all.

371
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,305
That can't be.

372
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,685
I'm broken.

373
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,604
That's why

374
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,524
I'm not fit to be king.

375
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,406
After beatings

376
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,078
and receiving so much hatred,

377
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,081
I've become numb.

378
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,712
I wanted to be king.

379
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,677
A king to guide my people.

380
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,107
You'll be king.

381
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,194
I'll help you.

382
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,865
If you don't feel pain,
I'll feel it for you.

383
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,493
Taste.

384
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,496
Smell. Everything.

385
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,626
But don't worry.

386
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,505
You're not numb at all.

387
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:30,803
That night when we saw the moon,
you felt its brightness.

388
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,238
I'll be with you.

389
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,532
Together,

390
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,285
we shall go back to Qin.

391
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,295
Let's go.

392
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,840
Hey, what's up with that kid?

393
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,929
Don't worry. He's fine now.

394
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:01,936
A signal fire!

395
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,396
They're coming after us.

396
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,482
Hurry. Ditch our things.

397
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,672
They're right behind us!

398
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,218
Still far from our rendezvous point.

399
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,304
Your Highness! Keep your head down.

400
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,270
Watch out!

401
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,107
Shika!

402
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,403
Behind the shield!

403
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,572
Enemy from the side.

404
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,664
Still four hours away from our rendezvous.

405
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,125
Damn it, we're doomed!

406
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,294
Don't give up, Amon!

407
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,964
We have arrows and a horse that's running.

408
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,632
Never say die!

409
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,429
Shika's right.

410
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,352
Our soldiers may be coming for us.
Focus on getting closer to Qin!

411
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,568
That's the spirit.

412
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,204
I see you've truly awoken.

413
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,124
Thanks to you.

414
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,935
There's Eisei! Kill him!

415
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,734
Your Highness! Forgive me!

416
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,321
Doken!

417
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,746
Your Highness.

418
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,540
A cloud of dust ahead. Our soldiers!

419
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,129
We're almost there!

420
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,687
Idiot! You stay down!

421
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,854
I can't!

422
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,732
-Down!
-Amon!

423
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,410
Forgive me.

424
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,205
It's okay. It's Shika's decision.

425
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:12,042
But let me say this. You go back to Qin.

426
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,836
Go back

427
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,839
and become a real king!

428
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,448
Amon.

429
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,498
Amon!

430
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,715
Hold the reins, please.

431
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,925
My hand.

432
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,843
Hurry!

433
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,220
Quick. There are more coming!

434
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,770
Got it.

435
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,338
Shika, are you alright?

436
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,589
Don't look back!

437
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,134
Focus or our cart will tip over.

438
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,976
I'm not done yet!

439
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,415
Shika!

440
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,416
Don't look!

441
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,936
Leave her. Kill Eisei!

442
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,981
I won't let you!

443
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,942
I won't let you!

444
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,657
Never!

445
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,640
Qin's cavalry is here!

446
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,227
Your Highness!

447
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,817
Take him down!

448
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,279
We made it, Shika!

449
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,001
Shika!

450
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,429
Shika.

451
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,264
Wake up!

452
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,392
Are you hurt?

453
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,354
I'm fine.

454
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,900
Thanks to you all, I can go back to Qin.

455
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,237
Thanks to you all,

456
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,365
I can become king.

457
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:15,345
You were born under an unlucky star

458
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:22,144
and were made to walk the path
no other royalty would ever tread.

459
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:30,277
No future king
has ever experienced such pain.

460
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,155
No one.

461
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,117
That's why

462
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,788
I know…

463
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,543
you'll be the greatest king ever.

464
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,673
Yes.

465
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,592
I definitely will.

466
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,720
I promise.

467
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,559
Your Highness.

468
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,611
I'm glad.

469
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,698
Free of your inner demons.

470
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,581
Your eyes.

471
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,211
They're so beautiful.

472
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,094
Shika.

473
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,055
Shika.

474
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,390
Shika.

475
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,645
No, Shika.

476
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,982
Shika!

477
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,861
Shika!

478
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,034
Shika!

479
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,800
That was my first promise.

480
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,143
Not only for Shika

481
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,231
but for those who died protecting me,

482
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,193
I must put an end to this war-torn era.

483
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,157
This is why

484
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,995
I am on a journey
that no one's dared to go on.

485
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,503
Will you kill me?

486
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,132
In that case,

487
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,554
I won't die without a fight.

488
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,684
To honor those who died protecting me.

489
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,396
Including Hyo.

490
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:22,240
Ethnic groups can only coexist
after blood has been shed.

491
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:29,539
Years of discrimination
and resentment can't be erased.

492
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,629
Yotanwa.

493
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,548
Join me on a journey.

494
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,428
A journey that no one's dared to go on.

495
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,931
At the end, there'll be light.

496
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,185
A unified China?

497
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:58,485
Do you think the other states
will agree with your idea?

498
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:03,865
If they don't, I'll have to use force.

499
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:06,952
I will be

500
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,460
the first emperor to unify our world.

501
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,324
I now see how determined you are.

502
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,369
King Eisei.

503
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,210
Come out, Shin.

504
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,346
Shin, my boy.

505
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,599
Call everyone back.

506
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,270
Commence the appointment ceremony.

507
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,367
Sure thing.

508
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,506
Actually,

509
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,928
I have something important
to convey to you.

510
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,556
What is it?

511
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,395
A message from King Sho

512
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,607
to you, King Eisei.

513
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,236
From King Sho?

514
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:16,122
The Zhao Army has already invaded Kansui.

515
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,627
Its people were massacred,
the place destroyed.

516
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:26,341
And now, our key defensive front, Bayo,
is under attack.

517
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,095
If they get past Bayo,

518
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,890
this bloodbath will spread
all over our state.

519
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:41,481
Qin's fate lies in your hands!

520
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,071
General Ohki.

521
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,200
I appoint you as our commander-in-chief.

522
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,121
Save Bayo

523
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:00,583
and demolish the Zhao Army
once and for all.

524
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,799
I, Ohki,

525
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,594
am at your service.

526
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,868
THE QIN ARMY'S CAMPSITE

527
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:40,165
45 KM SOUTHWEST OF BAYO

528
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,919
-They're all losers.
-Who needs them?

529
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,840
Form a "Go"! Squad Leaders assemble.

530
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,009
-Hey, Ryusen.
-Let’s team up.

531
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,260
No, pick me.

532
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,471
Oh no!

533
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,516
The Go making's begun.
Where are you, Shin?

534
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,394
Enough men for a 100-man unit.

535
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,773
Shin! You're supposed to be
our 100-man commander.

536
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,318
Our 100-man commander has arrived!

537
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,912
Hey!

538
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,747
You're all here.

539
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,707
Shin!

540
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,626
Hairo.

541
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,922
Don't care if they're roughnecks.
Gather up some tough ones.

542
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,840
Leave it to me.

543
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:47,106
Yeah, I think I see the chemistry here.

544
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,824
Twenty teams of Go roughnecks.

545
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:03,039
You guys are my commemorable
first 100-man unit.

546
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,295
That kid is our commander?

547
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,965
Bro, I'll bet you can beat him.

548
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,302
We don't belong to any other large units.

549
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,306
But we're a special 100-man unit
under General Ohki.

550
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,851
Under General Ohki?

551
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:30,650
I have no idea what we are
or what we're supposed to do.

552
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,653
All I can say is this.

553
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,323
If our general made us independent,

554
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,743
we'll be posted to a major battlefield.

555
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,707
We may even be ordered
to make a surprise attack.

556
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:51,087
Then we'll score big time
and make military exploits.

557
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,304
Most of us survived
the Battle of Dakan Plains.

558
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:04,100
We can confront any enemy
if we stick together.

559
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,606
Tomorrow, we will finally reach Bayo.

560
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,191
You sons of bitches!

561
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:18,323
We'll take down the Zhao Army
and score big time!

562
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,248
Is he the Shin we know?

563
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,833
He's amazing.

564
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:32,003
The kid grew up in six months.

565
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:36,841
I've been permitted
to have two vice commanders.

566
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,093
Vice Commander En.

567
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,180
Let's kick ass!

568
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,351
Who's the other?

569
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,562
That person's not here yet.

570
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,943
There she comes.

571
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,332
Yes!

572
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,501
Our reliable companion.

573
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,877
We've missed you.

574
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,754
Welcome back, Kyokai.

575
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,012
That's what I mean.

576
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,223
Alright!

577
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,893
My 100-man unit is complete!

578
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,882
I'll get you!

579
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,020
Your moves are better.

580
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,523
Right?

581
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:20,945
Give it back.

582
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,241
Show me your move.

583
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,537
That thing you did
when we were surrounded.

584
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,999
To-on, tan-tan

585
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,752
You're stupid after all.

586
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,339
In ancient times,

587
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:45,386
priestesses would do a sword dance
to calm the raging gods.

588
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,350
The Shiyu turned this into
a killing method.

589
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:56,856
They summon the gods
and in their intoxication,

590
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,484
they would kill while dancing.

591
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,781
This is the "Priestess Dance"
of the Shiyu.

592
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,618
What kind of gods do they summon?

593
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,203
No idea.

594
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:19,170
It's so unfair!
How come you guys get help from a god?

595
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,971
We're not the only ones.

596
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,643
Some masters of martial arts
can do the same

597
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,355
without knowing it.

598
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,530
But what's more terrifying

599
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,699
are those who host a god within.

600
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,160
Within?

601
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,495
That's right.

602
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,665
We called them

603
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,167
Bushin "War God".

604
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,170
"Bushin"?

605
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:12,223
Why did you decide to participate, Ohki?

606
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:15,226
Because of King Eisei's past story.

607
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:19,438
I too, must come face to face
with my past.

608
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,898
What do you mean?

609
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,775
I'm talking about Bayo.

610
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,408
I see.

611
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,954
I remember now.

612
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:42,003
Bayo was the castle
you, Kyo, and I had once taken

613
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,048
from the state of Zhao.

614
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,553
That's why

615
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:02,732
you cannot give up the land
where Kyo fell.

616
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:13,117
But who in the world was that brute
that defeated Kyo?

617
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,121
He seemed like "war" in disguise.

618
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,124
His name was Hoken.

619
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,545
No, don't go there. He's already dead.

620
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,256
Let us put the incident behind us.

621
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,259
For good.

622
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:32,071
BAYO CASTLE

623
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,009
Peasant soldiers, don't fall behind!

624
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,021
Deserters?

625
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,564
Yeah.

626
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:11,444
No deserters from our unit,
but rumor has it there are many elsewhere.

627
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:16,449
It was a last-minute call
and most of them are rookie soldiers.

628
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,828
The Zhao Army is invincible.

629
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,497
Some say Bayo is under siege

630
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,168
and they're waiting for us
to fall into their ambush.

631
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:31,505
There'll be more deserters
as we approach the battlefield.

632
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:37,136
Cowards everywhere.
There'd better be none in our unit!

633
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,263
Wimps!

634
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,015
Say that again.

635
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,852
Never heard of kid commanders.

636
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,854
No need to get excited.

637
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,444
Who do they think they are?

638
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,946
Ignore them.

639
01:07:56,614 --> 01:08:00,367
They're grouchy,
but you can trust their skills.

640
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:06,165
What we need to think about is
whether we can fight in this situation.

641
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:13,714
This isn't good, Commander Shin.
Our men's morale is getting low.

642
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,384
Damn.

643
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,099
Our cavalry.

644
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,233
General Ohki.

645
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,198
-It's him.
-General Ohki.

646
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,461
All armies…

647
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,882
forward.

648
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,681
He's awesome.

649
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,893
The greatest general on Earth!

650
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,124
Qin's cavalry!

651
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:27,473
All armies, halt!

652
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,899
They're here.

653
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,360
It's the Qin Army!

654
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:44,114
-Defensive line formation.
-Yes, sir!

655
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,666
They're changing formation.

656
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,919
Advance to the right!

657
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,170
Huh?

658
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,798
Advance to the right!

659
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,175
Moving away from Bayo?

660
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,159
They're moving to the side.

661
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,662
Given up their castle.

662
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,874
They're trying to lure us away.

663
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,626
Choso.

664
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,255
Well done, Fuki and Mangoku.

665
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,631
CHOSO ARMY'S STRATEGIST OF ZHAO, CHOSO

666
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:48,095
They feared our powerful cavalry
and avoided battle in the plains.

667
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:53,309
South from here is Kan Plains,
where our mobility will be obstructed.

668
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:58,605
If we stay and focus on Bayo, it will mean

669
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,150
turning our backs to Ohki.

670
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:05,237
That's not very wise.

671
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,241
No choice but to tag along.

672
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:16,665
We knew he'd choose Kan Plains
as our battlefield.

673
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,300
KAN PLAINS

674
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:30,429
15 KM SOUTH OF BAYO

675
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:34,308
Master Shoheikun predicts
it'll be this area.

676
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,770
He always tells us

677
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:43,025
the best way to learn
is to see and know the battlefield.

678
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:49,406
That's why I come here discreetly
and see for myself.

679
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:52,785
Ten.

680
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,079
You should see it, too.

681
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,207
See what real war is like.

682
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,926
The Zhao Army has followed us here.

683
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:55,139
Yes, they have. They're all pumped up.

684
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,183
Very pumped up?

685
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,519
Very pumped up.

686
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:04,106
-Very, very pumped up?
-Very, very pumped up.

687
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,108
-Very, very--
-My Lord.

688
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,027
We must get in position.

689
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,994
I wish you luck.

690
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:18,912
Yes, sir!

691
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,713
Damn! We're not at the front.

692
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,721
Both finished positioning.

693
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:45,314
The main attack from Zhao
will be by Mangoku's 40,000 army.

694
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:48,567
Their aim is to penetrate through
our side.

695
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,610
KANOH - MANGOKU

696
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:53,739
Meanwhile, our 30,000 right army
is on guard,

697
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:58,535
but Mangoku likes to push deep
into his opponent's camp.

698
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,830
A strategist known for "suicide attacks".

699
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,751
He'll come for our side,
closer to the central army.

700
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:12,508
On the other hand, we have
our 10,000 left army led by Kanoh.

701
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,425
KANOH

702
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,843
Just 10,000?

703
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:18,639
Yes, because it's General Ohki's
private army.

704
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:24,603
Six thousand of Ohki's men led by Kanoh,
together with 4,000 of Shobunkun's.

705
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:26,813
OHKI ARMY'S
LEADER OF THE LEFT ARMY ATTACK UNIT, KANOH

706
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,608
Our left army is an elite mercenary unit.

707
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,111
THE 1000-MAN COMMANDERS OF QIN
HEKI - SHOKAKU

708
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:37,449
On the other hand,
Fuki leads an army of 20,000.

709
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:45,332
Fuki has an eye for tactics
and the equal intellect of a strategist.

710
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:50,963
He can push and pull
and deploy formations accordingly.

711
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,342
He won't let us come close easily.

712
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,767
Because of the high hills
on the left side of the battlefield,

713
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,144
his army looks isolated.

714
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:11,483
It'll be easy to attack but hard to target
the central army from the side.

715
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:15,153
So, the outcome of this battle

716
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,365
depends on the right army, Moki?

717
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:22,786
Yes, for the Zhao Army.
But Qin's main force is the central army.

718
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:27,708
Mobu's 20,000 men with Ohki's 20,000
make 40,000.

719
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:32,170
While Zhao's central army consists of
Choso's 40,000 men.

720
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:41,138
Judging from his ability,
Choso must be the commander-in-chief.

721
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,726
The same number of men
in both central armies.

722
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:47,811
Yes, in numbers.

723
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:51,565
But most of Qin's men
are peasant soldiers.

724
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,655
The difference in military forces
won't matter.

725
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,992
It'll be the General's capability.

726
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,621
Their ability will decide the day.

727
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:15,547
Charge!

728
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,978
-They're off.
-Our central army.

729
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:36,401
Show us what you've got, Mobu.

730
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,245
Shield wall!

731
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,523
He's vicious.

732
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,525
No command for us yet.

733
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,111
Can't wait to get in there.

734
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,779
Zhao's right army!

735
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,169
Mangoku Army has charged.

736
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,506
We exceed in power and numbers.

737
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:44,177
They'll lose their men in vain
if they force their way in.

738
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,348
Now what will you do, Ohki?

739
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,310
That's our left army!

740
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,111
Heki.

741
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,624
Their left army has made a move.

742
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,294
Their left, too?

743
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:21,047
They must be crazy
to charge at Fuki head-on.

744
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,217
Ohki.

745
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,678
What are you up to?

746
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,449
Their left army is moving in.

747
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,951
They're outnumbered.

748
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,454
Go with the plan.

749
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:53,413
Yes, sir.

750
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:08,178
Forward!

751
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:10,472
They're daunted by us.

752
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:13,892
Thanks to General Ohki,
their morale is boosting.

753
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:30,909
Central and right are competing.

754
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:32,994
Come on!

755
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,121
Call us in.

756
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,165
Shin, my boy.

757
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,417
General Ohki!

758
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,295
I will give you a mission.

759
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,924
Show me what you've learned.

760
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,178
Sure. Leave it to me!

761
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:51,888
No "Yes, sir"?

762
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:59,354
As you can see,
10,000 men of our left army

763
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:03,942
have initiated an attack on
the 20,000 Zhao Army led by Fuki.

764
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,028
This will be

765
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,991
the most important battle
at this early stage.

766
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:13,994
With all due respect,

767
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:18,915
our left army doesn't have
any terrain advantage out there.

768
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,426
To fight efficiently,
it's standard tactics

769
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:33,930
to take away areas
that hold terrain advantage.

770
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,600
I know.

771
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,605
We made sacrifices to take
the enemy's hill at Dakan.

772
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:47,611
But there's a better way
than taking advantageous locations.

773
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:55,452
To kill competent enemy generals
one by one.

774
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:05,295
Fuki, who is now leading
his 20,000 right army,

775
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:08,757
is talented in warfare analysis.

776
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:15,180
As the battle reaches its climax,
generals like him will become

777
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,933
like thorns in our sides.

778
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:20,936
That is why

779
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:24,981
Fuki must be the first to go.

780
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:29,694
However, Fuki is a great warrior

781
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:30,904
and above all,

782
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:34,115
he has twice as many men as our left army.

783
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,786
It will not be easy.

784
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,081
So,

785
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:45,585
this is where Shin's 100-man unit
comes in.

786
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:54,177
Your unit will charge from the side
where both armies are fighting

787
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,640
and amidst the confusion,
you will take Fuki's head.

788
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:07,148
But that's impossible, sir!
It'll be a suicide mission.

789
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:10,193
What do you say, Shin?

790
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,863
Do you agree with En?

791
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:33,883
There's one thing I noticed
while training in the plains.

792
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:39,556
Hundred men in a huge army
are like tiny beans.

793
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,977
Still, a tiny bean
has a strength of its own.

794
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:46,438
It can slip through gaps.

795
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,441
Together, they're unbreakable.

796
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:55,488
If our 100-man unit
stick together and fight,

797
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:58,575
we can take down a 20,000-man commander.

798
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:10,712
Our 100-man special unit
will take on the mission.

799
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:20,388
You seem to have learned
a thing or two, Shin, my boy.

800
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:28,480
Now, here's your reward.

801
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:33,193
I will grant you a name for your unit.

802
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:35,195
A name?

803
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:40,366
As of now, you will call your unit…

804
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,453
Hishin Unit.

805
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:47,832
Hishin Unit.

806
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,004
Fly like an arrow

807
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,508
and thrust deep into enemy headquarters.

808
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:04,099
This battle is crucial.

809
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,310
No failure is to be tolerated.

810
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,855
I'll be counting on you.

811
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:15,860
Commander Shin of the Hishin Unit.

812
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:41,261
What is it?

813
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:45,932
I see a line of men between
the left and central armies.

814
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,023
Great eye-sight.

815
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,486
No, it can't be!

816
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,239
Their headquarters is beyond that cliff.

817
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:46,659
Look.

818
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,703
The Qin Army is pressing hard!

819
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:21,861
Alright.

820
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:26,074
Move back the front line.
The left and right armies in position!

821
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,450
Yes, sir!

822
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,412
Retreat!

823
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,790
Zhao Army, retreat!

824
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:35,208
Back off!

825
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,876
They're retreating.

826
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:42,382
We were pressing hard,
but there wasn't much of a resistance.

827
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:45,802
Go after them!

828
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:50,807
Get them!

829
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,438
Hold it! Hold your positions!

830
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,149
Heki Unit, halt!

831
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:13,746
Our left army seems to be in danger.

832
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,874
They're being lured.

833
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:20,211
Half of our left's vigor
is driven by ability.

834
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,505
The other half

835
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,466
is a trap of Fuki's.

836
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:34,350
Flank their left army from both sides.
Kill them all.

837
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,076
Heki! We're surrounded from both sides.

838
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,829
Archers, shoot!

839
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,335
It's a trap!

840
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:09,927
There's no time for unnecessary combat.

841
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:13,431
Run straight to the general
in column formation.

842
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:18,478
But the moment we break in,
they'll put up their defenses.

843
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:21,981
There's also a cliff
in front of their headquarters.

844
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:28,363
When we get past this,
our army will move in.

845
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,949
Then we'll attack Fuki from the side.

846
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:36,496
To open up a breach, we need power.

847
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:38,956
Hairo's friend, Ryusen.

848
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,835
Yeah, he's twice as strong as I am.

849
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,837
Right, Ryusen?

850
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:52,345
Hey, Ryusen, you don't look so good.

851
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:56,766
No kidding.

852
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,560
You're scared.

853
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,981
I don't blame him.

854
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:10,113
He told me his first child
was born last month.

855
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:15,201
That goes for us all.

856
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:18,788
We've all got someone waiting.

857
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:38,975
Back to our topic.

858
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,564
Our Hishin Unit is an arrow.

859
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:47,775
We can fly and take down our enemy

860
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,320
or we'll get smashed to pieces and die.

861
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:57,368
If we fail, all the men
in the left army will die.

862
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:02,039
Then everyone waiting for us
back home will die, too.

863
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:15,553
If we lose this war,
the Zhao Army will come rushing in.

864
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,431
Then, like the people of Kansui,

865
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:23,895
every man, woman, and kid will be
killed and left in a pool of blood.

866
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:26,564
Ryusen.

867
01:31:27,523 --> 01:31:30,151
The same will happen to your kid.

868
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,030
That's the kind of war it is.

869
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,165
Let's go, Commander.

870
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:48,044
Together, we'll score a victory.

871
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:17,865
Now!

872
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,790
Enemy attack!

873
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:30,461
There!

874
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:32,797
Ryusen!

875
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,967
-Moron, don't go alone!
-Does he have a death wish?

876
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:45,810
Hishin Unit!

877
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,395
Charge!

878
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:50,481
We're in!

879
01:32:50,564 --> 01:32:51,816
Shin!

880
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,068
Enemy attack!

881
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:56,612
Enemy attack from the left!

882
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:57,989
The left?

883
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:02,493
Which unit?

884
01:33:02,576 --> 01:33:03,786
We don't know.

885
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:07,081
Make way! Urgent message!

886
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:14,422
Hundred enemy troops from the left.
They've reached our second line.

887
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,466
All this way with just 100?

888
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,094
They seem to be acting solo.

889
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:22,930
What's going on?

890
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:25,766
I see.

891
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,269
I get it now.

892
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:33,316
So, you're after my head.

893
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,776
Interesting.

894
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:40,031
Well then, let's see you try, Ohki.

895
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,343
Go up that cliff!

896
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:16,776
Shin of the Hishin Unit.

897
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:19,737
Time for your ordeal.

898
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:32,375
Enemies!

899
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:42,635
Can't get any closer!

900
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:46,263
There's more. Throw them off!

901
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,682
There's more gathered down there.

902
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:49,975
Damn.

903
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,732
No good. We're surrounded.

904
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:58,067
Commander Shin.

905
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,112
Let's split.

906
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:02,488
Split?

907
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:05,866
We'll only run out of strength and die.

908
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,745
We should send out a crack team instead.

909
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:12,331
But the rest of you will die.

910
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:15,793
Our aim is to behead Fuki.

911
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:18,045
Then it'll be our victory.

912
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:22,258
We can stall the enemy here
while you go up the cliff.

913
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:25,136
I'd gladly stay behind for our victory.

914
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:26,595
Me, too.

915
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:32,143
Me, too. Someone has to stay
and lead our unit.

916
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:34,145
I'll stay behind.

917
01:35:34,728 --> 01:35:35,855
Guys.

918
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,027
We need to win, right?

919
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,658
When you break through, we'll disengage.

920
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:50,703
Leave these guys to me and En.

921
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,372
Yugi.

922
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,666
Hurry, Commander Shin.

923
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:12,141
En, we'll go,
but survive this no matter what.

924
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:13,642
Of course.

925
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:16,645
We'll all survive.

926
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,898
-Let's go.
-Okay.

927
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:19,815
Yugi.

928
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,903
I'll see you later.

929
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:28,324
Sure. Take Fuki's head for us.

930
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:29,950
We will.

931
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,001
Let's go.

932
01:36:39,084 --> 01:36:40,211
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

933
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:55,351
They've split the unit.

934
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,967
En and Yugi are waiting.

935
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:30,594
Hang in there, you sons of bitches!

936
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:35,558
What? A detached force?

937
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:43,649
Take out the leader!

938
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:44,608
Shin!

939
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,319
No, you won't!

940
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,494
Stop everyone!

941
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:56,412
Crush them!

942
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:57,830
Bring it!

943
01:37:57,913 --> 01:37:59,206
Reporting!

944
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:03,877
Some from the enemy unit
are approaching the clifftop.

945
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,504
Our garrisons?

946
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:07,047
They're at battle.

947
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,635
They're just peasant soldiers.

948
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:15,889
An easy 100-man unit. Wipe them out!

949
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:23,522
Enemies!

950
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:34,491
I see him.

951
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:42,875
No way we're going to get in.

952
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:52,926
Even in small numbers,
they've become unstoppable.

953
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:57,765
I must say I admire Fuki's skill
at destroying half of Qin's left army.

954
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:02,186
But he paid the price
by letting the Hishin Unit in deep.

955
01:39:02,978 --> 01:39:05,981
Fuki excels in long-distance combat

956
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:09,735
but not in short distance combat.

957
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,738
For the Hishin Unit,

958
01:39:13,947 --> 01:39:16,325
the real battle is yet to come.

959
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:21,705
Shin, you're the one who said
we're like an arrow.

960
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:23,290
Right.

961
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:28,212
Now's the time to show them

962
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:31,382
that our Hishin Unit is no ordinary arrow!

963
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:35,761
Sure is!

964
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:38,597
You're kidding.

965
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:40,391
Let's go then!

966
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:42,059
You're crazy.

967
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,147
Crazy!

968
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,536
Crazy!

969
01:40:07,918 --> 01:40:09,378
What's the commotion?

970
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:24,893
I'll cover you.
Run like mad and go take Fuki's head!

971
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:26,437
Go, Shin!

972
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,487
Be careful!
The general's guards are tough.

973
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:36,864
I know.

974
01:40:46,081 --> 01:40:48,208
Don't let them near our headquarters!

975
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,794
Run!

976
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,214
We broke through!

977
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:57,968
Bodyguards, line formation!

978
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:06,143
From the side!

979
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,574
Bro!

980
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,872
Go, Shin!

981
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:28,040
Go!

982
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:30,626
Bihei! Bito!

983
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:43,388
Heki!

984
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:04,326
You're finished.

985
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:07,788
Central army, forward!

986
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:21,301
Their central army is moving.

987
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:26,014
We're done!

988
01:42:27,724 --> 01:42:29,142
Hang in there!

989
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:43,574
-Go, Shin!
-Sure!

990
01:43:05,762 --> 01:43:06,722
Go!

991
01:43:34,499 --> 01:43:37,252
Damn, the closer I get,
the tougher they get.

992
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:45,886
Fuki!

993
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:47,220
I'll cover you.

994
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,513
A split second.

995
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:52,100
That's all I need.

996
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,399
Can't hold them back.

997
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:02,110
These guards won't budge!

998
01:44:13,246 --> 01:44:14,790
Come on!

999
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,215
We're at our limits!

1000
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:41,274
Dammit!

1001
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,196
We can close in and finish them off.

1002
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:51,702
Stop wasting time
on those peasant soldiers!

1003
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:06,758
This is the first time I've ever
let an enemy come this close.

1004
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:12,097
Could such a small unit
have come all this way here by luck?

1005
01:45:12,597 --> 01:45:14,850
Break into headquarters?

1006
01:45:15,934 --> 01:45:20,063
My plan was to surround
Qin's left army and destroy them.

1007
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,941
But if I hadn't moved both wings,

1008
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:26,445
they couldn't have come this far.

1009
01:45:28,321 --> 01:45:29,364
Impossible!

1010
01:45:30,782 --> 01:45:34,369
Was I led into moving both wings?

1011
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:39,958
If their army of 10,000 were to come
charging at our 20,000,

1012
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:43,003
I would move both wings to surround them.

1013
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:48,341
Is that why Ohki made his left army
come at us?

1014
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:53,472
The advance of that small unit
was no coincidence.

1015
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:57,768
I'd been caught in Ohki's scheme
from the very start!

1016
01:46:06,234 --> 01:46:11,198
You're a genius manipulating
the battlefield without leading it.

1017
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:17,913
That's because, surprisingly,
I don't dislike it.

1018
01:46:17,996 --> 01:46:19,873
Long-distance combat, that is.

1019
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:26,755
Kyokai!

1020
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:40,060
Retreat.

1021
01:46:40,852 --> 01:46:41,686
Sir?

1022
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,522
Retreat!

1023
01:46:43,605 --> 01:46:45,023
Pull back!

1024
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:52,072
Fuki! Too late for that!

1025
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,742
There's no getting away.

1026
01:46:56,451 --> 01:46:57,869
General Fuki.

1027
01:47:01,456 --> 01:47:03,041
Shin, go!

1028
01:47:04,417 --> 01:47:07,420
There goes our Lord's arrow!

1029
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:39,327
I got him.

1030
01:48:09,774 --> 01:48:10,609
Hey, kid.

1031
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:14,487
Did our Lord name your unit?

1032
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:20,076
Hishin Unit.

1033
01:48:22,704 --> 01:48:24,623
Zhao General Fuki's head

1034
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:29,085
has been taken by Shin of the Hishin Unit!

1035
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:46,436
Zhao General Fuki's head has been
taken by Shin of the Hishin Unit!

1036
01:48:59,824 --> 01:49:04,412
Well done, Shin of the Hishin Unit.

1037
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:29,646
You're a real commander now.

1038
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:32,357
Shin.

1039
01:49:56,548 --> 01:49:59,467
Qin's flag is hoisted on enemy camp.

1040
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,094
Their general's down.

1041
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:03,847
Shin! You did it!

1042
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,181
Yes!

1043
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:22,240
General Fuki is killed!
Our right army is defeated.

1044
01:50:22,324 --> 01:50:23,325
Not yet.

1045
01:50:23,908 --> 01:50:25,952
Our battle isn't over.

1046
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:29,539
There's a man
who'll lead us to our victory.

1047
01:50:30,498 --> 01:50:34,502
All armies! Move our headquarters.

1048
01:50:35,211 --> 01:50:36,212
Which way?

1049
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,256
Backward.

1050
01:50:53,521 --> 01:50:54,981
They're retreating.

1051
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:58,193
This isn't good.
They're headed to the mountains,

1052
01:50:58,693 --> 01:51:02,155
where they can ambush us,
unlike in the plains.

1053
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:05,784
The Zhao Army has fled.

1054
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:10,413
Who are you?

1055
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:14,459
Lord Riboku, our seat has been taken.

1056
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,754
No need to be alarmed.

1057
01:51:18,254 --> 01:51:20,799
We've come to watch.

1058
01:51:20,882 --> 01:51:24,135
Would you allow us to join you?

1059
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:33,478
Well, well.

1060
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:36,106
They've retreated too easily.

1061
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:39,776
Toh.

1062
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:43,863
Was there another strategist
besides Choso?

1063
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:48,326
No, My Lord. Not that I recall.

1064
01:51:50,703 --> 01:51:53,039
Something smells fishy.

1065
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:55,625
Is it a trap?

1066
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,713
We'll let this one go.

1067
01:52:01,214 --> 01:52:02,799
Nevertheless,

1068
01:52:02,882 --> 01:52:07,595
we must find out
who this mystery commander is.

1069
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:16,146
For now, we shall move along with them.

1070
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:45,341
Let's get them.

1071
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:47,427
Our lord will decide.

1072
01:52:48,052 --> 01:52:50,054
We'll go tomorrow.

1073
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:55,310
We'll leave at sunrise.

1074
01:52:56,352 --> 01:52:57,520
One thing.

1075
01:52:58,021 --> 01:53:00,440
You must promise me this.

1076
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,320
The farthest you can go

1077
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:10,074
is up to where you see Zhao's
former headquarters mountaintop.

1078
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:14,829
All of you.

1079
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:19,584
-Never ever break this promise.
-Understood, sir!

1080
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:40,897
Our Hishin Unit…

1081
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:44,651
Lost 31 men.

1082
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,114
What's with the glum face?

1083
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,951
Smile for them.

1084
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:56,663
They'd be happier that way.

1085
01:54:02,627 --> 01:54:03,503
Right.

1086
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:08,967
He's right.

1087
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:10,885
General Ohki!

1088
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,471
Shin, my boy.

1089
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:18,184
Do you know why I gave your unit a name?

1090
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:22,855
So it can be called?

1091
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,567
So people can remember

1092
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:28,778
our allies as well as our enemies.

1093
01:54:29,737 --> 01:54:30,822
Our enemies?

1094
01:54:32,365 --> 01:54:37,287
Every soldier in the Zhao Army
should know by now

1095
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:39,706
that the one who killed Fuki

1096
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:43,918
was Shin of the Hishin Unit.

1097
01:54:44,544 --> 01:54:46,546
But that's not all.

1098
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:50,258
Fuki was a renowned general.

1099
01:54:51,384 --> 01:54:54,095
Since you defeated him,

1100
01:54:54,178 --> 01:54:57,599
your name will spread across all of China.

1101
01:54:58,266 --> 01:54:59,642
Though,

1102
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:04,355
it'll only take a while
until everyone forgets you.

1103
01:55:07,483 --> 01:55:12,572
But if my name and our unit's name
come up every time…

1104
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:15,533
then,

1105
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:21,164
the name will be known
across all of China.

1106
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:25,293
Yeah!

1107
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:28,254
Let's make it happen!

1108
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:33,927
Well done, all of you. I commend you.

1109
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:57,659
Let me explain for those
who missed what happened.

1110
01:55:58,159 --> 01:55:59,202
Do Fuki.

1111
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:01,287
Not again.

1112
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:03,039
Give me a break.

1113
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:05,041
Enough. I'll ask Shin.

1114
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:07,335
Yeah, you drunkard.

1115
01:56:08,419 --> 01:56:09,754
Sit down, will you?

1116
01:56:09,837 --> 01:56:12,507
Don't you want to see it?

1117
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:14,133
You missed it.

1118
01:56:15,009 --> 01:56:15,843
Cut it out.

1119
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:47,625
You're really something.

1120
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:48,835
Bito.

1121
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:55,466
A year ago, you were
the stupidest slave in our village.

1122
01:56:56,384 --> 01:57:01,389
Now, you're a 100-man commander
and took the head of our enemy.

1123
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:03,474
I'm not stupid.

1124
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:13,943
When we get home, you'll be a hero.

1125
01:57:15,069 --> 01:57:19,407
Yeah, everyone in our Hishin Unit
will be heroes.

1126
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:24,370
Right. Us too?

1127
01:57:24,454 --> 01:57:26,039
Absolutely.

1128
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:32,462
What is it?

1129
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:34,630
We're tired of seeing it.

1130
01:57:35,548 --> 01:57:38,801
Okay, enough is enough.

1131
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:40,762
What, Bihei?

1132
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:56,611
Who the hell are you?

1133
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:02,492
Which unit?

1134
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:07,205
Please stop.

1135
01:58:11,959 --> 01:58:13,961
Don't ignore us.

1136
01:58:22,303 --> 01:58:25,056
Enemy attack! Sound the alarm!

1137
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:33,773
We found out who Zhao's
commander-in-chief is.

1138
01:58:33,856 --> 01:58:35,441
Who is it?

1139
01:58:35,525 --> 01:58:37,527
A man called Hoken.

1140
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:40,571
Hoken? Who is he, Shoheikun?

1141
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:42,949
I've never heard of him.

1142
01:58:43,991 --> 01:58:47,829
No, it can't be.

1143
01:58:48,788 --> 01:58:49,789
Impossible.

1144
01:58:50,665 --> 01:58:52,416
What is it, Shobunkun?

1145
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:54,252
What do you know?

1146
01:58:57,672 --> 01:59:01,342
Hoken is the name of the man

1147
01:59:02,885 --> 01:59:06,472
who killed the Great General Kyo
nine years ago.

1148
01:59:11,227 --> 01:59:12,478
However,

1149
01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:17,191
he was supposed to have been slain
by Ohki.

1150
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:24,782
What do you mean?

1151
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:30,663
Didn't Kyo, one of Qin's
Six Great Generals, die from an illness?

1152
01:59:33,749 --> 01:59:35,376
Back then,

1153
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:41,257
Kyo had become a symbolic figure
of our Six Great Generals.

1154
01:59:42,091 --> 01:59:43,551
But then,

1155
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:47,889
she was suddenly killed by an unknown man.

1156
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:51,475
We couldn't admit it.

1157
01:59:53,394 --> 01:59:55,354
So, Ohki and I decided

1158
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:58,900
to have Kyo die of an illness.

1159
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:04,238
Shobunkun.

1160
02:00:06,073 --> 02:00:08,367
You will pay for twisting the facts.

1161
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,664
But first, you must tell us
what kind of man Hoken is.

1162
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:18,669
He is

1163
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:24,300
not the kind of warrior who leads men.

1164
02:00:24,383 --> 02:00:27,094
He is a complete individual.

1165
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:30,598
Or rather, the man is

1166
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:36,812
a result of a horrifyingly pure
"art of war".

1167
02:00:45,696 --> 02:00:48,616
This guy's dangerous. Be careful!

1168
02:00:49,325 --> 02:00:50,618
I'll stop him.

1169
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:52,495
Run!

1170
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,002
-Yugi.
-Bro!

1171
02:01:04,882 --> 02:01:06,384
Yukaku!

1172
02:01:13,808 --> 02:01:15,977
This can't be happening.

1173
02:01:16,477 --> 02:01:17,895
You bastard!

1174
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:20,064
Stop! He's no match for you.

1175
02:01:20,147 --> 02:01:21,232
Shut up!

1176
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:28,072
Perhaps Ohki had known from the beginning.

1177
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:32,743
That's why he took the post
of commander-in-chief.

1178
02:01:34,412 --> 02:01:40,251
But then why would Hoken
become the commander of Zhao now?

1179
02:01:42,586 --> 02:01:44,380
Could it be?

1180
02:01:45,673 --> 02:01:48,384
Hoken has come to destroy Ohki.

1181
02:01:53,097 --> 02:01:55,224
Most likely, Your Majesty.

1182
02:01:59,228 --> 02:02:01,105
This is a fateful battle

1183
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:05,484
that goes back nine years.

1184
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:08,779
A war of vengeance.

1185
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:29,342
-Shin!
-Commander!

1186
02:02:44,899 --> 02:02:47,610
He dodged Kyokai's blow!

1187
02:02:55,826 --> 02:02:56,994
Who the hell are you?

1188
02:02:59,163 --> 02:03:02,124
I am Hoken, Bushin "War God".

1189
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:06,003
"Bushin"?

1190
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:18,325
Defeating an invincible equestrian tribe
one-sidedly?

1191
02:04:31,172 --> 02:04:34,842
Looks like there's quite a monster
lurking around

1192
02:04:36,093 --> 02:04:38,220
in this state of Zhao.

1193
02:06:09,311 --> 02:06:12,314
