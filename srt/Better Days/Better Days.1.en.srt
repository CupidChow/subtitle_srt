1
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,667
School bullying is a worldwide phenomenon.

2
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,500
It may be happening around us right now.

3
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:20,584
We hope this film will engage
and unite us against bullying

4
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,334
and extend hope to those who are in need.

5
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,834
Does anyone know the difference
between "was" and "used to be"?

6
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,125
Anyone?

7
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,709
"Was" means it has passed.

8
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,875
In fact, both of them mean
that it has passed.

9
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,625
But the difference is that "used to be"

10
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,125
carries a sense of loss.

11
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,000
Understand?

12
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,459
Let's go over the sentences again.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,875
One. One, two, one.

14
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,000
- Score 600!
- Score 600!

- Is it her?

23
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,500
REALLY? WHY?

24
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,709
Really?

25
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,625
Stop taking photos!

26
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,959
Phones away! Everyone back
to your classroom.

27
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,834
OKAY

28
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,334
TOO MUCH PRESSURE?

29
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,709
WHAT HAPPENED?

30
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,375
SELF-DISCIPLINE, WORK HARD, NO REGRETS

31
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,917

00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,000
Chen Nian.

36
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,375
They asked for you.

37
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,084
Relax.

38
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,209
We just need to ask you a few questions.

39
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,625
Did Hu Xiaodie say anything to you
the day she died?

40
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,000
Nothing.

41
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,125
Are you sure?

42
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,709
Take your time.

43
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,459
Think hard.

44
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,500
I heard you're taking
the college entrance exam this year.

45
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,084
You enrolled in a remedial course

46
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,084
to get into a prestigious college, right?

47
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,209
Her old school
wasn't academically up to par.

48
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,959
Did Hu Xiaodie have
any close friends in school?

49
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,334
You don't need friends here.

50
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,125
Do you mean you or her?

51
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:52,709
Just me.

52
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,459
I don't know about others.

53
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:56,875
Suicide is a serious matter.

54
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:00,834
Did she appear
emotionally disturbed to you?

55
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,209
Or did something happen to her?

56
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,500
Chen Nian.

57
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,417
If you know something, tell us.

58
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,709
The school board is highly concerned
about campus safety.

59
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,000
The school and your teachers
will protect you.

60
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:14,917
Don't be afraid.

61
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,625
Why did you do that?

62
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,959
You said you barely knew her.

63
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,125
It's time for class.

64
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,709
They can't spare more time.
Exams are approaching.

65
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:43,000
But we need your cooperation
in this investigation.

66
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,709
Hu Xiaodie...

67
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,834
wouldn't have wanted

68
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,000
to be seen like that.

69
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,000
Didn't you hear the bell?

70
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,209
Rise.

71
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,167
Salute.

72
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,250
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, sir.

73
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,334
Sit.

74
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,584
What's wrong?

75
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,875
Who did this?

76
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,917
The exam is almost here.
There is no time for pranks!

77
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:44,459
Also, try to get along
with your classmates.

78
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,792
But if you do get bullied,
you must tell me.

79
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,334
Okay?

80
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,209
- Good day, sir.
- Hold on.

81
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,084
- Okay.
- I'll deal with your child later.

82
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:55,625
I am your teacher.

83
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:57,917
I care about your grades
as well as your life.

84
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,459
Is your mom home yet?

85
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,292
No.

86
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,417
Okay, go back to class.

88
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,792
The child will have her exam soon.

89
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,209
Someone must be home.

90
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,584
- Zhou Lei!
- I know you are in there!

91
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,000
Stop hiding, open the door!

92
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:41,959
Zhou Lei!

93
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,625
Open the door!

94
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,917
- Zhou Lei!
- Pay us back!

95
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,292
Are you going to order that?

96
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,042
What? Stewed pork dumplings?

97
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,875
Stop pushing me.

98
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,459
Chen Nian's over there.

99
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Let's go to her.

100
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,500
Hi. We're coming in.

101
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,875
Hey. Your ranking is up again this week.

102
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,250
What?

103
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,042
I'm asking you.
How did you manage to do so well?

104
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you want to join our study group?

105
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,709
Why not?

106
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,834
I want to ask you a few English questions.

107
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,459
I don't have time.

108
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:49,750
No time?

109
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,334
Or does she not want to spend it on you?

110
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:53,917
Nonsense.

111
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,667
Chen Nian is not that petty.

112
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,292
She's a good person.

113
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,500
And she's good to her fellow students.

114
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:00,959
Isn't that right, Chen Nian?

115
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,375
Look here. Let me take your picture.

116
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,375
Chen Nian!

117
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,167
Hey, are you okay?

118
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,792
Don't worry.

119
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,625
We just want to show our appreciation
for covering Xiaodie's body the other day.

120
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,625
It was very touching.

121
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,084
But when you talked to the police,

122
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,750
I wasn't so touched anymore.

123
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,667
So what did you tell them?

124
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,292
Mom, I told you already.

125
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,709
Don't open the curtains.
The creditors will show up.

126
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,542
Where were you? You came back so late.

127
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:34,292
Hey.

128
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,667
Where did you find this?

129
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,167
- I've been looking for it all day.
- Isn't the mask contraband?

130
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,292
Why are you using it?

131
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,375
It won't perform miracles,
but it won't kill you.

132
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,334
What actually happened?

133
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,042
- Let's listen to the interviews.
- Mom!

134
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,834
When the emergency...

135
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,042
DELIVERY ORDER

136
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:04,959
Are there a lot?

137
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,542
Not really.

138
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,917
So this is how hair turns grey overnight.

139
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,292
But you keep doing it. It's illegal.

140
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,875
I'm a victim too.

141
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,625
The area I picked isn't bad.

142
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:26,542
When I get my cut,
you'll get your college tuition.

143
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,584
How are your studies?

144
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,084
Good.

145
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,500
My test scores are among the top ten.

146
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,667
I know I'm not a good mother.

147
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,709
Be patient.

148
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,959
Once you graduate from university,
we'll escape this hellhole.

149
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,125
I know I owe you.

150
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,250
Boys, help the girls.

151
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,292
You're still laughing.

152
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,709
You won't be laughing
when you fail your exam.

153
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,917
I'm telling you.

154
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:31,042
Your placement now won't determine
your future social status.

155
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,417
There will be a lot of challenges.

156
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,875
If you don't want to suffer in the future,
work hard now.

157
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,584
Some of you deserve praise though

158
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,917
for performing well, such as Wei Lai.

159
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:42,917
Keep it up.

160
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,042
Thank you, sir.

161
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,125
Luo Jun.

162
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,459
I worry I'll be seeing you again
next year.

163
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:04,042
- Now!
- Mess him up!

164
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,375
- Come on!
- How dare you beat up my brother?

165
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,709
You wanted me to go to hell?
You go to hell first!

166
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:09,667
Bottle!

167
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,584
- Where is your bravado?
- Get up!

168
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,667
Aren't you tough?

169
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,584
Someone is getting beaten up by a gang...

170
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,167
Come here!

171
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,125
Hey, she called the police.

172
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:33,792
Is he your boyfriend?

173
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,334
We're talking to you!

174
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,125
- Speak up!
- No.

175
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,792
Then why did you call the police?

176
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,750
Crazy bitch!

177
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,542
Give me your bag!

178
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,125
Fifty yuan?

179
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,667
Give me your phone.

180
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,625
- I said give me your phone!
- Hey.

181
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,417
She's just a girl.

182
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,500
I get it now.

183
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:01,584
Get him.

184
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,167
This bitch likes him.

185
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,500
She's helping him because he's handsome.

186
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,334
Make her kiss this mad dog!

187
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:08,667
Kiss him!

188
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,917
Kiss him. Do it.

189
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,000
Hurry!

190
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,917
- Are you deaf?
- I'm letting you kiss him.

191
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:18,084
- Didn't you hear me?
- Do you have a death wish?

192
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,250
Hurry up and kiss him!

193
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:20,292
Kiss him!

194
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,209
Do you want him to die?

195
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,042
Are you going to kiss him?

196
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:25,500
Do it!

197
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:35,167
She did it!

198
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,959
- She really did it!
- She kissed him!

199
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,084
How dare you mess with my brother.

200
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,625
- They kissed!
- Who the hell are you?

201
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:50,209
Brother!

202
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,792
Brother, are you all right?

203
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,084
This is not over!

204
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:07,875
How much did they take?

205
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:11,959
- Answer me.
- Fifty yuan.

206
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:17,875
I don't have change.

207
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,417
Bei!

208
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,209
Give me your phone.

209
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,750
I thought we're here for change.

210
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,542
You have to buy something first.

211
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,875
MOBILE PHONE REPAIR

212
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,417
This... will cost 200 yuan.

213
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,459
- What?
- I'm not scamming you.

214
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,625
Look. It needs major repairs.

215
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,250
The parts alone cost 150 yuan.

216
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:50,125
Fine.

217
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,709
Give me 50 back.

218
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,667
Fine. You're so cheap.

219
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,375
Not even service charge.

220
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,750
Fix it yourself.

221
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:23,042
- You can fix phones?
- I deal with stolen phone parts.

222
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,792
You had it repaired before?

223
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,959
Most of the original parts were replaced.
You didn't watch the repair?

224
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,917
- They probably stole your data too.
- I don't have any important data.

225
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,209
Fool.

226
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,792
You're a perfect target.

227
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,667
How about this?

228
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,542
If you pay me, I can give you protection.

229
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,792
You can't even protect yourself.
How can you protect me?

230
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,084
Getting beat up is nothing.

231
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,334
I always get even in the end.

232
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:12,834
Then you go ahead.

233
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,417
I am going to the best university
in the country.

234
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,542
Unlike you.

235
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:22,834
How are we different?

236
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,750
Haven't you seen it for yourself?

237
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,917
Either you bully others

238
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:29,709
or you get bullied.

239
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:32,334
So which one are you?

240
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,834
Is your house on the left or right?

241
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,792
You don't have to escort me.
It's just nearby.

242
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,875
What's your name?

243
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,334
You can't even tell me
even if we've kissed?

244
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:34,459
Hey.

245
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,750
POLICE

246
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,292
Pull down your hood.

247
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,625
- How did you get hurt?
- Is it a crime to be hurt?

248
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,917
- Just answer the question.
- Show me your ID.

249
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,750
EXPOSED! DON'T TRUST THIS CROOK

250
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,042
- Look at this.
- "Your daughter is still in school."

251
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,875
"It will be ugly if we take it to court."

252
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,625
Seriously?

253
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:08,834
How shameless!

254
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,792
EXPOSED! DON'T TRUST THIS CROOK

255
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,625
Chen Nian! Liu from Class Five wants
to buy a facial mask!

256
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,542
Shut up! Enough already!

257
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:47,709
THE SMART ALWAYS FIND WAYS,
THE FOOLISH TRAP THEMSELVES

258
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,459
- Where to?
- Wherever.

259
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:34,125
Sit.

260
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,750
Shut the door.

261
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,500
I HAVE MONEY TO HELP YOU AND YOUR MOM

262
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,209
Are you fighting with your boyfriend?

263
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,792
Why come here if you have one?

264
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,459
SWITCH OFF

265
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:41,917
Do you like me?

266
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,334
What's there to like?

267
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,542
I've never even considered it.

268
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,792
Why follow me home then?

269
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,542
I didn't expect you to bring me here.

270
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,084
Is my place too shabby for you?

271
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:14,625
Don't worry.

272
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:18,250
- I'm not going to sleep with you.
- Why bring it up then?

273
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,875
I did consider it though.

274
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:25,417
- Are you going to keep talking about it?
- I'm just making small talk.

275
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,167
Has no one ever taught you manners?

276
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,750
Are you scared now?

277
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,084
I'm just a punk.

278
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,084
Why bother with manners?

279
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,167
Class is over.

280
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,750
You can go and study if you wish.

281
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,417
Put the balls back when you leave.

282
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,167
My mom said,

283
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,542
"Like mother, like daughter.
Like a chip off the old block."

284
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,875
You must be exhausted

285
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,542
from paying your mom's debt.
How can you even play today?

286
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,667
Are you done?

287
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:51,792
Chen Nian.

288
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,584
- Chen Nian.
- Chen Nian.

289
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,125
Are you all right?

290
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,084
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

291
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:11,500
Be careful
when using the stairs next time.

292
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,334
Keep your wound dry.

293
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:14,792
Done.

294
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:34,542
Just one more month
and we can go to Beijing.

295
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,459
What if I can't hold out?

296
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,375
Like Hu Xiaodie.

297
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,084
She was weak.

298
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,250
She let those people affect her.

299
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,167
She wasn't the only weak one.

300
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,875
You and I are weak as well.

301
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,917
They've been bullying me all along.

302
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,209
Why didn't any of you do anything?

303
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,000
Hello, Officer Zheng?

304
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,209
That's absurd.

305
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:49,500
I don't remember.

306
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:52,917
I'm afraid of ghosts.

307
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:55,625
Hu Xiaodie was a slut.

308
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,250
Everyone hated her.
What does it have to do with us?

309
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:03,250
What about Chen Nian?
Didn't you push her down the stairs?

310
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,667
Tell me how you bullied her.

311
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,250
You believe Chen Nian?

312
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,834
I know nothing.

313
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,667
We're good friends with Chen Nian.

314
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,209
We play pranks on one another
all the time.

315
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,334
- Pranks?
- Just now...

316
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,000
So what prank did you play
that killed Hu Xiaodie?

317
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,375
Do you have proof?

318
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,250
Would you be here if I didn't?

319
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,042
It was her choice to kill herself.
I have nothing to do with it.

320
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,250
She didn't want to study.
Her mom forced her.

321
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:35,500
Her grades were terrible.

322
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,625
The teacher said third-tier universities
were her best hope.

323
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,292
Maybe it was all too much for her.

324
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,042
Don't you feel even a tiny bit of remorse?

325
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:47,834
Who's calling?

326
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,459
Your mom.

327
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,959
Good timing.
Your parents should see you now.

328
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:54,167
Answer it.

329
00:35:57,834 --> 00:36:01,334
You should've asked for them sooner.
Why ask me so much bullshit?

330
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,250
I didn't do anything.

331
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,709
Even if my mom comes,

332
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,375
I won't give them a penny.

333
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,459
Isn't it good that Hu Xiaodie died?

334
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:15,334
How else would her mom
get such a big payout?

335
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:18,125
If she sues,
she might even get a half million!

336
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,250
If Xiaodie hadn't died
and had gone to university and worked,

337
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:24,375
It would've taken her years
to earn that much money.

338
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,334
There's something I want to tell you.

339
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,334
School bullying cases are tricky.

340
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:13,167
You can't file charges
without hard evidence.

341
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:16,667
In the end, the Ministry of Education
always intervenes.

342
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,000
More witnesses will come forward.

343
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:20,959
Why were you a bully
when you were young?

344
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,125
I did not.

345
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,875
Then you must have been bullied.

346
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,167
I don't smoke.

347
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,667
Empathy only comes with age.

348
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,834
You just tend to forget the wrongdoings.

349
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,292
We weren't nearly as bad as they are now.

350
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,792
It's quite common now.

351
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,042
Not long ago,

352
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,292
a group of secondary school students
beat a classmate to death.

353
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,500
When I took their statements,

354
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,875
none of them thought

355
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:52,500
that you could beat someone to death.

356
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:57,167
Just because these cases happen on campus,

357
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:00,167
it doesn't make the school responsible.

358
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:04,834
If you try talking to the principal,
he'll pass it onto the teachers.

359
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,209
If you go to the teachers,
they'll pass it onto the parents.

360
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:10,375
Then the parents will say,
"I work in Shenzhen.

361
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,584
I only see my kid once a year."

362
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,334
Who else is there left?

363
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:20,125
No matter what, we are the police.

364
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,667
We must try our best to help.

365
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:31,500
Please give her a chance. I'm begging you.

366
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,209
- I'll kneel!
- Mom.

367
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,125
Xiaomiao, come. Kneel!

368
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:38,875
- Don't kneel!
- Beg your teacher!

369
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:39,959
Please get up.

370
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,292
- Beg your teacher.
- Get up.

371
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:45,334
- Please reinvestigate. Please!
- What are you doing?

372
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,875
Don't get physical!
This is a school. Behave yourself!

373
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,834
- Get back inside.
- Please get up.

374
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,459
- Please help us.
- Get up.

375
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,917
- Who are you? Stop!
- Don't stop me!

376
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,959
- Call security!
- Why can't you learn?

377
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,667
- What are you doing?
- Stop! Don't move!

378
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,334
Why are you hitting her?

379
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,959
Is this how you parent your child?

380
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,209
This is ridiculous!

381
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:06,125
They've all been suspended.

382
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,292
But they will still take
the college entrance exam.

383
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,292
They're still young.

384
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,084
We want to give them a second chance.

385
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,542
Try to get past this.
Don't let this distract you.

386
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:28,667
Chen Nian.

387
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:32,750
You did the right thing.

388
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:39,584
Trust that you did the right thing.
There will always be shadows on your path.

389
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,542
But when you look up,
you will always see the light.

390
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,042
I'm responsible for this as well.

391
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:51,334
You will have a new homeroom teacher.

392
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,209
Chen Nian!

393
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,667
Are you disappointed in me?

394
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,042
I'm disappointed too,

395
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,667
but who can I blame?

396
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:36,875
- We did the best we could...
- But you know the truth, don't you?

397
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,209
When I was 18, I didn't like to sleep.

398
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,000
My teacher said,

399
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:59,125
"Try the police academy
or a medical school.

400
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,959
Both professions require
working at night."

401
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,584
I did what she said and became a cop.

402
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,750
Gradually,

403
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,334
I learned to appreciate sleep.

404
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,875
You know why?

405
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:16,125
There are people and things
I would rather not see.

406
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:17,959
We're not that kind of family.

407
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,334
Her dad and I always teach her

408
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,834
about principles and moral values.

409
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:27,084
What kind of people to befriend
and how to befriend.

410
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,792
They're essential social skills.
Other kids don't have to consider those.

411
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,917
But she needs to.

412
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,667
She's different.

413
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,959
Things aren't always what they seem.

414
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:41,500
For instance,
what's the background of the parents?

415
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,167
Why was the child emotionally disturbed?

416
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,417
Shouldn't the school take responsibility?

417
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,125
Moreover, everything needs proof.

418
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:52,042
If we must get to the bottom of it,
things will turn ugly.

419
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:55,125
Have you ever seen
the eyes of wild animals

420
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,417
just before they're killed?

421
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,500
My child is still young and naive.

422
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:03,292
It's hard to say
who's the innocent one here.

423
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:04,667
They have no expression.

424
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,584
None at all.

425
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,042
It's because they're afraid.

426
00:42:11,584 --> 00:42:14,042
That's why they're expressionless.

427
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:16,792
You don't need to be afraid anymore.

428
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,167
Concentrate on your exam.

429
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,500
Yes.

430
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,375
Once the exam is over,
we will become adults.

431
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,750
My mom said the advantage of getting older

432
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,209
is you begin to forget things.

433
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:39,417
So don't let anything affect you.
You'll forget it all in the end.

434
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,709
But what they don't teach you

435
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:46,500
is how to be an adult.

436
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,459
Chen Nian, listen to me.

437
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,667
Growing up is like diving.

438
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:04,625
Don't think, just close your eyes
and jump in.

439
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,917
There will be sand, rocks
and clams in the river.

440
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,625
That's how we all grow up.

441
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:24,834
Nian, are you home?

442
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Have you eaten?

443
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,834
Yes.

444
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:35,084
I ran into some trouble.

445
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:38,042
Some people had allergic reactions
to the mask.

446
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,625
They make a scene here everyday.

447
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,250
Hello?

448
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,500
Then come home. Just quit.

449
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,625
I can't make money back home.

450
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,584
Not to mention the creditors.

451
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,667
You're safer at home without me.

452
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,667
You're a child.
They won't do anything to you.

453
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:06,125
Hello?

454
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,959
Do you have enough money?

455
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Yes, I do.

456
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:16,167
Doesn't the mask give you rashes?

457
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,792
I can't let it go to waste.

458
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,959
Don't blame me if anything happens.

459
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:21,167
I won't.

460
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:23,875
You want one? Buy it yourself.

461
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,250
Once I make it to Beijing,
everything will be fine.

462
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,334
Let's open a small shop
in front of the university.

463
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:33,209
I'll grab students off the street.

464
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,917
Let's make money off my classmates.

465
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,375
All right. That's my girl.

466
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,459
I know I can count on you.

467
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,000
Listen, you're amazing.

468
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,500
So am I.

469
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:51,375
We're reincarnations of the Monkey King.
We're both invincible.

470
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,667
The end is right before us.

471
00:44:58,584 --> 00:45:01,375
Don't screw up now. Okay?

472
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,417
I heard you.

473
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,584
Trust me.

474
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,875
- Keep it up.
- Sure.

475
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,667
I'm hanging up.

476
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:13,917
Rest up.

477
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:15,209
Bye.

478
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,334
I'm really hanging up.

479
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:21,292
Bye.

480
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:40,459
We should all stand up against bullying.

481
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:43,084
If anyone should need help,
seek your teachers.

482
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,834
The school will take the matter seriously.

483
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:47,959
43 DAYS TO NATIONAL COLLEGE
ENTRANCE EXAM

484
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,125
The entrance exam is very stressful,

485
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:52,500
but the students' well-being
is our priority.

486
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,959
The school will strengthen
its counseling service.

487
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:57,917
Please approach the counselor
if you have any questions.

488
00:45:58,334 --> 00:45:59,750
We must persist!

489
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,667
It's you against the world.

490
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:06,375
If you can stand your ground,
you will prevail.

491
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,417
We are not afraid, right?

492
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,542
- Yes.
- Yes.

493
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:12,500
Class dismissed.

494
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:20,292
What kind of replacement teacher is he?
He's horrible.

495
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:29,417
Students, you'll be graduating soon!

496
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:32,750
You'll be entering
the first stage of your life.

497
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:34,417
Are you happy?

498
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,542
- Happy!
- Happy!

499
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:38,000
Let's take the picture!

500
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,084
You're graduating! Smile!

501
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,334
- Smile!
- Look into the camera. Three, two, one.

502
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:45,750
Say cheese!

503
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,292
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

504
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,750
You dared to call the cops?

505
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:29,292
Why don't you follow
Hu Xiaodie's footsteps...

506
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,500
and die?

507
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:37,750
Chen Nian! Are you rushing to your death?

508
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:53,625
Chen Nian, why are you running?

509
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,125
Chen Nian, where are you going?
Stop running!

510
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,750
You think you can escape?

511
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:02,750
Stop!

512
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:04,917
Stop!

513
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:15,875
Stop right there!

514
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,209
That way!

515
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:55,417
Did you see her?

516
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:01,625
Go to her house!
She'll go back eventually.

517
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,417
OFFICER ZHENG

518
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,000
I can't take calls during interrogation.

519
00:49:28,084 --> 00:49:29,167
What's the matter?

520
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,042
Zheng Yi, he's talking. Hurry back.

521
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:36,750
Chen Nian?

522
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,084
I'm sorry, I misdialed.

523
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,500
Can you protect me?

524
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:05,167
I don't have money to pay you.

525
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:09,167
But I must go to Beijing.

526
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:24,459
Don't move.

527
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:03,167
Do you feel hot?

528
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:07,917
What did you say?

529
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,542
Do you feel hot?

530
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,709
No.

531
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,375
Is it hard?

532
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,334
What?

533
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,375
Is the couch hard?

534
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:32,459
No, it's not.

535
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:47,750
Didn't you look down on me before?

536
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,250
Give me your notebook.

537
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:13,667
What?

538
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:15,667
Give me your notebook.

539
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,792
Bring a pen too.

540
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:31,500
Write this down.

541
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,459
"Chen Nian owes Bei one time."

542
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:41,084
I haven't specified what it is.

543
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,500
It could be just a meal.

544
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:52,542
CHEN NIAN OWES BEI ONE TIME FOR...

545
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:56,542
I didn't say it would be a meal.

546
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,500
It could be something else.

547
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:05,209
You have to get up early tomorrow.

548
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:40,250
Hey.

549
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,292
Don't touch Chen Nian.

550
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:13,500
Watch him.

551
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,584
Where's the money?

552
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:30,500
What are you looking at?
You dare to come here without the money?

553
00:56:33,709 --> 00:56:35,334
Pay us for the last job first.

554
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:41,542
Grade 12 students, raise your right hand

555
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:42,834
and take the oath!

556
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:45,834
I vow.

557
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:47,417
I vow.

558
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,709
I will not fail my parents!

559
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:53,167
- I will not disappoint my teachers!
- I will not disappoint my teachers!

560
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,084
You still owe me money!

561
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:56,709
Get lost!

562
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
I will smile confidently...

563
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,167
- ...as I strive for success and glory!
- ...as I strive for success and glory!

564
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:05,834
32 DAYS TO EXAM

565
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,500
WORK HARD, NO REGRETS

566
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:09,459
A plus B...

567
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:16,959
Six of bamboo.

568
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:21,709
Three of characters.

569
00:57:27,084 --> 00:57:28,084
Five of characters.

570
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,667
Five of characters again.

571
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:41,500
Can't do it?
Then you're not eating tonight.

572
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:12,834
What are you memorizing?

573
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:14,459
An essay.

574
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:15,750
What for?

575
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,125
Our teacher can predict exam topics.

576
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:20,917
Predict?

577
00:58:27,834 --> 00:58:28,834
Don't tell me.

578
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:30,959
I don't want to know.

579
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,959
Why don't you go to school?

580
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:39,459
It's useless.

581
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:40,542
It's not.

582
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:44,709
It's useful to you.

583
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,584
Not to me.

584
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:49,917
Bunch of punks.

585
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:52,125
You dare cause a scene in my joint?

586
00:58:52,834 --> 00:58:55,000
I'll set things right
on behalf of your parents.

587
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:58,709
Don't you like to fight?
What are you waiting for?

588
00:58:59,084 --> 00:58:59,917
Fight!

589
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:15,000
You're too pure.

590
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,084
You won't get it.

591
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,375
Who has been protecting you?

592
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,917
Can he protect me too?

593
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:39,167
Why is it my turn now?

594
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,167
I did everything they said.

595
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,834
I'll walk you home.

596
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:05,750
Does it hurt?

597
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:09,500
I'm used to it.

598
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:18,500
Since when?

599
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,584
Since I was 13.

600
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:31,500
My dad left us.

601
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:35,667
My mom was burdened with me.

602
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:38,959
She couldn't handle it.

603
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:42,584
She met a man later.

604
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:47,917
One morning, when I woke up,

605
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:52,334
she came home with some meat buns.

606
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I was so happy.

607
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:01,292
Meat buns were a rare treat.

608
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:06,000
But as soon as I ate,

609
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,875
she slapped me.

610
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:14,084
With tears running down her face.

611
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,875
That man dumped her.

612
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Because of me.

613
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,834
Did she get married eventually?

614
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:51,250
I went back to look for her.

615
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:55,500
But she had moved.

616
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:14,750
Chen Nian.

617
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,584
You're the first person
to ask me if it hurts.

618
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:42,542
You're here.

619
01:03:43,209 --> 01:03:44,459
- Thank you, bye.
- Bye.

620
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:52,125
Are you being stalked lately?

621
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,417
I'm heading out for a bit.

622
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,625
It's not the first time
I've seen someone following you.

623
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,834
Can university graduates
earn thousands a month?

624
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,917
More than that.
At least tens of thousands.

625
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,125
Can we make that much?

626
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:38,500
Look at us.

627
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,709
We don't steal things or deal drugs.

628
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,209
How can we ever make that much?

629
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,167
But you're good-looking.

630
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,167
You could sell your body.

631
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,292
Maybe I'm not who you think I am.

632
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:03,875
What did you say?

633
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,792
I ignored Hu Xiaodie
because she wanted to be my friend.

634
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:11,917
I actually liked her.

635
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:18,084
Don't you think
maybe I don't deserve your kindness?

636
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,459
What did you just say?

637
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:33,500
It's coming.

638
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:41,584
Focus.

639
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:45,459
What are you doing?

640
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:58,125
Do you want to...

641
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,667
get away from this together?

642
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:07,750
How?

643
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:24,917
There must be a way.

644
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:28,042
One day, we'll walk proudly
in broad daylight for the world to see.

645
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:37,625
Come.

646
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:40,625
- Swerve.
- Come.

647
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:41,667
Medic!

648
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,584
- Shoot!
- Everyone, stay put.

649
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,084
- Don't run.
- Don't move!

650
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:46,917
- What's happening?
- Que up.

651
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,584
- Raise your head! I am talking to you!
- Come!

652
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:50,625
- Come!
- Stand up!

653
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,042
- You.
- What are you doing?

654
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,625
- You! And you!
- Stand up.

655
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:57,125
- You three, come with me. Stand up.
- Officer. We are really good students.

656
01:06:57,209 --> 01:06:58,292
- Get in line!
- Come on!

657
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,584
- One by one, move forward.
- Where to?

658
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:01,792
- Stand up.
- Walk.

659
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:03,209
- We got a tip-off.
- Move it.

660
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:05,292
Someone saw
a suspected rapist here.

661
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:06,959
- Move.
- Please cooperate.

662
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,709
How long will this take?

663
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,084
Who knows?

664
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,750
They're looking for a rapist.

665
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:30,584
A girl is here to identify him.

666
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:32,209
Then why did you run?

667
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:35,292
I thought you were the owner of the place.

668
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:39,292
- What time is it?
- I don't even look like a rapist.

669
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:43,584
- I'm asking you.
- Have you been raped before?

670
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:45,917
When will you release us?

671
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,584
It's not your first time.
It'll be done when it's done.

672
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:11,792
The number you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

673
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,750
Shut up if you want to live.

674
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,250
Shut up if you want to live!

675
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:26,584
Get serious.

676
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:27,709
Next.

677
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,875
Shut up if you want to live!

678
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,000
Shut up...

679
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,250
if you want to live!

680
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:45,750
Get serious!

681
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:48,667
Sir, can I try again?

682
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,917
Put on the masks we gave you.

683
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:52,959
Stand up straight!

684
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,834
The number you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

685
01:09:20,459 --> 01:09:22,625
- Here comes the bitch!
- You're the bitch.

686
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:23,667
Again!

687
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:24,875
Dodge!

688
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,709
- Bitch!
- Bitch!

689
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:29,542
- Slap her.
- Crying won't help. Why bother?

690
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,375
- What's with that look?
- Hey!

691
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,709
- Where are you going?
- You can't go.

692
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:35,000
Are the books important?

693
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,500
You want to go to university?
In your dreams.

694
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:40,000
- A close-up shot.
- Miao, come here.

695
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:41,500
- Hit her.
- Go on.

696
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:47,459
- Good one!
- That's more like it!

697
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:49,959
Goodness.

698
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:52,084
Come on, go ahead!

699
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:58,125
A close-up shot!

700
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,542
- We're cutting her hair.
- Cut!

701
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,792
- Cut!
- More, keep going!

702
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,417
- More!
- Cut it all off.

703
01:10:10,209 --> 01:10:12,000
So now you're not talking?

704
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,334
- Goodness.
- Why are you crying?

705
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,000
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

706
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:17,125
Quit crying!

707
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:19,167
Do guys like you?

708
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:22,834
Let's see. You're not even pretty.

709
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:24,709
How did you get guys to help you?

710
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:26,334
What a pretentious slut.

711
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:28,334
You must have a great body.

712
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:29,459
Do you want to see it?

713
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,459
- Yes!
- Yes!

714
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,042
Let's see what you've got! Strip her!

715
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:37,542
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!

716
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,709
- What are you doing? I've called the cops!
- What a bitch!

717
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,834
We just say the same thing
to the police every time.

718
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,459
That guy must be going to prison.

719
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:09,584
It's just a bottle.

720
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:01,875
Let go.

721
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:03,709
Let go!

722
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:05,417
Let go!

723
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,917
- Let go!
- Go kill them all then!

724
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,125

Of course.

743
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:20,334
Of course I trust my little girl.

744

Where were you the night of May 31st?

795
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:06,292
I was at the hospital.

796
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,042
Many people saw me.

797
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:09,584
You can ask around.

798
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,375
Your car was captured on CCTV
near the crime scene.

799
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,125
The trunk was tested positive
for traces of blood.

800
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:17,209
Explain that.

801
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,542
My car...

802
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:23,000
was stolen.

803
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:24,500
Stolen?

804
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:28,250
Who would return a car
after murdering someone?

805
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:30,750
Don't you own a motorbike?

806
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:34,209
Unless it's someone you know.

807
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,209
What do you need my dad's cab for?

808
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,209
His shift starts early tomorrow.

809
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,125
I want to try driving a cab.

810
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,250
Kang.

811
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:47,375
Yes?

812
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:48,834
We're buddies, right?

813
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,125
Then listen to me.

814
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:56,667
Get a full checkup from a doctor.

815
01:22:57,042 --> 01:22:58,000
Test everything.

816
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,709
Don't return home until you're done.

817
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:05,792
Hey!

818
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,625
You'll be fine.

819
01:23:09,792 --> 01:23:11,625
Whatever they ask, just tell the truth.

820
01:23:41,334 --> 01:23:42,417
Is she really dead?

821
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,042
Why are you smiling?

822
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,709
I'm not.

823
01:23:48,959 --> 01:23:51,000
Wei Lai hasn't called me since that day.

824
01:23:51,084 --> 01:23:51,959
"That day"?

825
01:23:56,042 --> 01:23:57,417
It has nothing to with me.

826
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,459
They all went mad that day.

827
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:02,209
If I didn't do as told,
they would have killed me.

828
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:04,709
Chen Nian killed her.

829
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:07,584
You're accusing Chen Nian
because you've been bullying her.

830
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,625
Who's the bully here?

831
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:12,334
Wei Lai feared for her life.

832
01:24:19,959 --> 01:24:21,000
Quit crying!

833
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:23,542
So now you're not talking?

834
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,625
- Give her a haircut.
- Don't like the haircut?

835
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:27,750
How is the haircut?

836
01:24:28,084 --> 01:24:30,625
You have no right to cry.

837
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:33,750
- Quit crying!
- Why are you crying?

838
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:44,959
I saw the video.

839
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,667
Why didn't you call the police?

840
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:54,750
I had to focus on the exam.

841
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,917
I've already filed a complaint before.

842
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:03,000
Can't we...

843
01:25:03,334 --> 01:25:05,042
postpone this until after the exam?

844
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:08,125
I still have two papers left.

845
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:11,042
No.

846
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,709
You must come with me.

847
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:16,709
Chen Nian.

848
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:20,000
Wei Lai is dead.

849
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:22,209
You're a prime suspect.

850
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,375
Chen Nian.

851
01:25:49,292 --> 01:25:51,167
You're being interviewed as a suspect.

852
01:25:51,834 --> 01:25:54,292
Tell the truth and they'll be lenient.

853
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:55,834
Understand?

854
01:25:59,834 --> 01:26:00,667
Answer me.

855
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,334
I understand.

856
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,875
Did you tell your mom after the incident?

857
01:26:09,084 --> 01:26:10,209
Has she returned?

858
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,000
No.

859
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:16,792
Did it affect your studies?

860
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:19,292
They filmed you.
Why didn't you report them?

861
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,834
I told you I wanted to focus on my exam.

862
01:26:26,209 --> 01:26:27,084
Really?

863
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:29,542
They took naked pictures of you.

864
01:26:29,792 --> 01:26:33,250
You were assaulted but didn't report it.
How could you stay focused?

865
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,542
When was the last time you saw Wei Lai?

866
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:47,292
I haven't seen her since the incident.

867
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:53,375
- How did she die?
- Just answer the questions, understand?

868
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:57,167
Yes.

869
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,750
Where were you the night of May 31st?

870
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:07,750
At home, studying.

871
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:09,917
I study at home every day.

872
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,417
Any witness?

873
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:18,250
It's okay. We can ask your neighbors.

874
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:33,959
Hey.

875
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,459
Are you done?

876
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:39,417
So?

877
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,542
She doesn't have an alibi.

878
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,125
But we don't have any evidence,
just motive.

879
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,209
Let's release her for now.
She has exams tomorrow.

880
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:53,584
- What do you think, Wang Li?
- Her reactions were odd.

881
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:56,334
What's the right reaction?
Should she cry and scream?

882
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,875
Don't allow emotions
to cloud your judgment.

883
01:27:59,959 --> 01:28:01,625
What about Fang Yongkang's car?

884
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,125
Did Chen Nian steal it?

885
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,542
She's tiny.
How could she have moved the body?

886
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,959
What's your problem?
She might have an accomplice.

887
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:10,334
What's wrong with you?
You're being unprofessional.

888
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:11,334
Enough.

889
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,125
Calm down, you two.

890
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,042
A girl just filed a report.

891
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:16,917
She was almost raped in a park.

892
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,125
She saw the attacker's face.
It fits the serial rapist's description.

893
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:23,084
Wang Li, the girl is not in...

894
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:31,042
Release Chen Nian.
Keep her under surveillance.

01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:36,625
Call for help.

908
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,542
There's no time.

909
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,000
Scream for help now.

910
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,584
I stalked you and harassed you.

911
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,125
I tried to rape Wei Lai
but accidentally killed her.

912
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:49,542
No. You didn't.

913
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:51,792
I left evidence. They're looking for me.

914
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:57,417
I'll turn myself in.

915
01:32:01,209 --> 01:32:02,125
Chen Nian.

916
01:32:04,209 --> 01:32:05,500
Look at me.

917
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:08,334
Can't you see?

918
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:10,875
I'm a guy with nothing.

919
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,459
No brains, no money,

920
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:14,792
no future.

921
01:32:17,084 --> 01:32:18,375
But I love someone.

922
01:32:19,709 --> 01:32:21,250
I want her to have a happy ending.

923
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:26,209
I won't leave you.

924
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:31,084
I'm a minor.

925
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:36,334
I won't get a harsh sentence.

926
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,625
When you graduate from university,

927
01:32:41,584 --> 01:32:42,625
I'll already be out.

928
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:47,125
I'm not going anywhere.

929
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:50,584
Only if you succeed...

930
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,917
will I not be a total loser.

931
01:33:02,334 --> 01:33:03,209
You go first.

932
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:04,959
Find somewhere safe.

933
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:06,084
No.

934
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:08,375
Chen Nian.

935
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,875
When you grow up...

936
01:33:16,334 --> 01:33:18,167
We'll meet again, right?

937
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:36,292
Don't forget.

938
01:33:38,334 --> 01:33:39,417
You still owe me one.

939
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:18,584
Shut up if you want to live!

940
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:36,584
Hold him!

941
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,834
Don't move!

942
01:35:27,042 --> 01:35:28,334
Shut up if you want to live!

943
01:35:29,084 --> 01:35:31,334
Help!

944
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,667
You said you were pretending
to be the rapist

945
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:44,750
when you assaulted Zhang Jing
and Chen Nian.

946
01:35:44,834 --> 01:35:46,084
Check the records.

947
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,584
My buddies and I were dragged here

948
01:35:51,209 --> 01:35:52,625
to stand in the lineup.

949
01:35:53,167 --> 01:35:54,334
We were later released.

950
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:57,292
I'm not the rapist you're looking for.

951
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:00,500
I don't understand.

952
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:02,334
You're a good-looking kid.

953
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:04,542
You could easily get a girlfriend.

954
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,209
Why did you do it?

955
01:36:07,209 --> 01:36:08,667
Take a guess.

956
01:36:09,209 --> 01:36:10,584
Guess right and I'll tell you.

957
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:13,167
- Guess wrong and I won't.
- Shut up!

958
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,875
I don't have time for bullshit!

959
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:16,167
No more questions.

960
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,625
You speak.

961
01:36:17,709 --> 01:36:19,417
Give me all the details.

962
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,042
I've already told him everything.

963
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:22,875
Nothing more.

964
01:36:23,084 --> 01:36:23,959
Listen up.

965
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:28,084
- Hard evidence carries more weight.
- Then go find the evidence.

966
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,250
I have nothing else to add.

967
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:39,459
If Li Lifang saw you right now,

968
01:36:41,917 --> 01:36:42,834
how would she feel?

969
01:37:06,292 --> 01:37:09,667
I want to give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

970
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:16,167
Our people are tracking down your mom.

971
01:37:18,084 --> 01:37:19,167
Do you want to see her?

972
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:24,709
Don't you want to know how she is?

973
01:37:27,709 --> 01:37:30,417
Would you rather confess
or see your mom like this?

974
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,917
What do you want?

975
01:37:44,834 --> 01:37:45,875
Just get to the point.

976
01:37:46,792 --> 01:37:48,292
Have you seen this girl before?

977
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:53,000
She's Wei Lai. She was killed and buried.

978
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:57,334
The lab ran a test and confirmed

979
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:00,542
that the skin found under her nails
belongs to you.

980
01:38:03,667 --> 01:38:05,459
Liu Beishan, why did you kill Wei Lai?

981
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:21,167
DELETE

982
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:34,917
She'd still be alive
if she did what she was told.

983
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,334
But she kicked and bit me.

984
01:38:38,417 --> 01:38:39,500
It hurt.

985
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,084
So I pushed her.

986
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,167
She died just like that.

987
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:23,875
The man who called the cops?

988
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,709
I've apologized to him
and deleted the video too.

989
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:28,292
They all listen to me.

990
01:39:29,209 --> 01:39:30,084
See?

991
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:34,334
What do you want?

992
01:39:35,834 --> 01:39:37,542
Please don't report me to the police.

993
01:39:40,584 --> 01:39:41,625
How much do you want?

994
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:43,500
I can give you any amount.

995
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,042
Just tell me.

996
01:39:46,917 --> 01:39:47,917
Tell me.

997
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:56,292
If you want, you can film me too.

998
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:57,292
Chen Nian.

999
01:39:59,292 --> 01:40:01,417
Hit me.

1000
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,917
Yell at me, slap me.

1001
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:06,959
I can't repeat another year.

1002
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:11,292
My dad hasn't talked to me in a year.

1003
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:12,917
- Please.
- I don't want to hear it.

1004
01:40:13,834 --> 01:40:15,250
You don't have to forgive me.

1005
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:17,042
Just don't file a report.

1006
01:40:17,667 --> 01:40:19,792
We all went overboard.

1007
01:40:20,584 --> 01:40:22,584
I beg you, Chen Nian, I'm so sorry.

1008
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,584
Just name your terms.

1009
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:27,250
I'll agree to anything.

1010
01:40:27,542 --> 01:40:28,834
I beg you.

1011
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,375
I can't repeat another year.

1012
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:35,792
I don't want to see you ever again.

1013
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:39,209
Understood.

1014
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:51,667
Wait!

1015
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:05,459
If you don't want to see me again,

1016
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:07,959
let's not apply to the same university.

1017
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,584
What's your first choice?

1018
01:41:09,834 --> 01:41:11,042
Mine is Peking University.

1019
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:12,542
And yours?

1020
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:20,875
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.
Let's hope we both do well in the exam.

1021
01:41:23,042 --> 01:41:24,084
What a pity.

1022
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:26,209
We could have been friends.

1023
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:29,917
Luo Ting is an idiot.
Xu Miao is two-faced.

1024
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,750
But you're decent.

1025
01:41:32,084 --> 01:41:33,167
My mom is right.

1026
01:41:33,334 --> 01:41:36,250
Make friends with good people
and life will be easier.

1027
01:41:36,584 --> 01:41:38,334
- Easier?
- Yes.

1028
01:41:38,417 --> 01:41:40,792
I took care of the video,
and you won't report me.

1029
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:42,417
We can both forget about it,

1030
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,834
like nothing happened.

1031
01:41:44,459 --> 01:41:46,459
It's more important
to live in the present.

1032
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:51,042
Hey, are you sure you don't want money?

1033
01:41:51,209 --> 01:41:53,125
I would feel better if you accepted some.

1034
01:41:53,334 --> 01:41:55,209
You could clear your mom's debts.

1035
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:57,875
Then you two can stop hiding
and live with some dignity.

1036
01:42:19,792 --> 01:42:20,667
I failed.

1037
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:38,625
You said you've never met Liu Beishan.

1038
01:42:40,209 --> 01:42:43,334
But your classmate said he saw
Liu Beishan stalking and harassing you.

1039
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,667
Do you recall?

1040
01:42:47,084 --> 01:42:48,084
I don't remember.

1041
01:42:50,792 --> 01:42:54,000
She just needs to put up a weak act
and men would flock to protect her.

1042
01:42:54,292 --> 01:42:56,042
Are all men such pigs?

1043
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:07,417
Li,

1044
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:10,334
I need CCTV footage of Chen Nian's
daily commute to school.

1045
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:15,500
Zoom in on that guy in grey.

1046
01:43:16,334 --> 01:43:17,292
More.

1047
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,209
What do you want to do?

1048
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,334
Study and take the exam.

1049
01:43:32,917 --> 01:43:34,125
Go to a good school.

1050
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:36,667
Become one of the smart ones

1051
01:43:37,084 --> 01:43:38,084
and find answers.

1052
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:40,625
If possible,

1053
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:42,917
protect the world.

1054
01:43:44,417 --> 01:43:45,459
Can you do it?

1055
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:48,209
I'm going to try.

1056
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
It's a deal.

1057
01:44:03,542 --> 01:44:04,750
You'll protect the world.

1058
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:06,667
I'll protect you.

1059
01:44:14,459 --> 01:44:18,084
- Strip her! Take it all off!
- Strip her!

1060
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:19,959
- Strip her!
- Let me do it.

1061
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:23,459
- Strip her!
- Bitch!

1062
01:44:23,542 --> 01:44:25,209
Tell me if you can't watch anymore.

1063
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:29,000
What do you mean?

1064
01:44:30,334 --> 01:44:31,292
This is good stuff.

1065
01:44:32,542 --> 01:44:34,042
But the camera is shaky.

1066
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,542
I can't see it very well.

1067
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,375
Tell me, which one is Wei Lai?

1068
01:44:46,792 --> 01:44:47,625
I can't tell.

1069
01:44:47,709 --> 01:44:49,209
Why did you skip the middle one?

1070
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:51,667
It's gross.

1071
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:52,917
They're all gross.

1072
01:44:53,834 --> 01:44:55,334
You knew that one was Wei Lai.

1073
01:44:56,417 --> 01:44:58,209
- Strip her!
- Come on!

1074
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:00,667
I did not.

1075
01:45:02,084 --> 01:45:03,667
Why are you showing me this?

1076
01:45:03,834 --> 01:45:05,500
Maybe you've seen her corpse,

1077
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:08,125
so you know what she was wearing
when she died.

1078
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:09,750
Just so you know,

1079
01:45:10,084 --> 01:45:11,709
- Chen Nian is here.
- What do I care?

1080
01:45:12,292 --> 01:45:13,459
She's next door.

1081
01:45:14,334 --> 01:45:16,292
My colleague is interrogating her.

1082
01:45:17,959 --> 01:45:21,000
Is it my fault that I got bullied?

1083
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:24,042
I'm sorry about
what you had to go through.

1084
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:26,834
But if you had trusted us adults,

1085
01:45:26,917 --> 01:45:28,250
we could have had helped you.

1086
01:45:28,334 --> 01:45:29,334
Who can help me?

1087
01:45:30,584 --> 01:45:31,959
The ones who filmed me?

1088
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:34,125
Or the onlookers?

1089
01:45:34,459 --> 01:45:37,000
Or the ones who blame me

1090
01:45:37,584 --> 01:45:38,834
for being targeted?

1091
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,584
So you took matters into your own hands.

1092
01:45:43,042 --> 01:45:45,000
You confronted Wei Lai and took revenge.

1093
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:52,000
Revenge may seem normal to most people.

1094
01:45:52,917 --> 01:45:54,959
But those who are forced
to bear with things

1095
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:57,250
just to get through
the college entrance exam

1096
01:45:57,834 --> 01:45:59,125
are considered wrong?

1097
01:46:02,667 --> 01:46:04,667
If this is how the world works,

1098
01:46:05,417 --> 01:46:07,417
would you bring a child into it?

1099
01:46:12,917 --> 01:46:14,375
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

1100
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:15,500
Okay.

1101
01:46:30,042 --> 01:46:31,625
You are Chen Nian's friend.

1102
01:46:32,459 --> 01:46:33,375
So am I.

1103
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:35,667
You want to help her, so do I.

1104
01:46:36,334 --> 01:46:38,584
But kid, you're too naive.

1105
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:42,209
You thought you had the perfect plan,
but we saw through you right away.

1106
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:44,125
Do you take the cops for idiots?

1107
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,125
Even if you keep quiet,

1108
01:46:47,209 --> 01:46:48,959
Chen Nian is still a prime suspect.

1109
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,459
Do you get what I'm saying?

1110
01:46:52,792 --> 01:46:54,042
There's only two of us now.

1111
01:46:54,667 --> 01:46:58,042
Tell me what happened
and I'll figure out how to help you two.

1112
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:09,459
Drop the act.

1113
01:47:11,334 --> 01:47:12,584
Aren't you tired?

1114
01:47:15,292 --> 01:47:16,917
Tell your man to come back in.

1115
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:29,250
Fine, I'll be blunt.

1116
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,167
You are friends with her.
She was bullied

1117
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:34,292
so you killed Wei Lai together
out of revenge.

1118
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,125
You uneducated fool.

1119
01:47:38,209 --> 01:47:39,875
Chen Nian came by herself today.

1120
01:47:41,375 --> 01:47:43,000
Do you want to know what she said?

1121
01:48:06,417 --> 01:48:07,250
Thanks.

1122
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:18,209
We don't need your confession.

1123
01:48:18,334 --> 01:48:19,417
Chen Nian broke down.

1124
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:20,750
Chen Nian.

1125
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:23,417
What do you know about the world?

1126
01:48:24,084 --> 01:48:26,834
You held out, but she couldn't.
She has confessed everything.

1127
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,584
Or about the world of convicts?

1128
01:48:29,042 --> 01:48:31,625
Do you know
how they treat rapists in prison?

1129
01:48:31,709 --> 01:48:33,917
Everyone will gang up on him.

1130
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:38,417
Even if you want to sacrifice yourself
for someone else,

1131
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,834
you should first consider
if they're able to handle it.

1132
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:45,292
Unless this is what you want.

1133
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:47,625
You go to heaven

1134
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,250
while someone else rots in hell.

1135
01:48:54,542 --> 01:48:55,417
You accuse me

1136
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,417
of letting someone else take the fall
and leaving them to rot in hell.

1137
01:48:59,667 --> 01:49:00,834
Who do you mean?

1138
01:49:01,584 --> 01:49:03,750
You said
even if I want to sacrifice myself,

1139
01:49:04,584 --> 01:49:06,125
they might not be able to take it.

1140
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:07,875
Who do you mean?

1141
01:49:08,334 --> 01:49:11,292
You said everybody wants to help me.

1142
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:15,084
Who can really help me?

1143
01:49:16,042 --> 01:49:17,917
Why do you insist that I'm helping her?

1144
01:49:18,834 --> 01:49:21,000
What am I getting out of it?

1145
01:49:21,584 --> 01:49:22,959
I'll say it again.

1146
01:49:23,542 --> 01:49:24,667
Drop the act.

1147
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:26,834
I didn't make anyone take the fall for me.

1148
01:49:26,917 --> 01:49:28,875
I, Liu Beishan, am not an idiot.

1149
01:49:28,959 --> 01:49:31,917
Wei Lai's death has nothing to do with me.

1150
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,292
I only kissed and molested her.
I don't know her.

1151
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:37,542
I have never met Liu Beishan before.

1152
01:49:51,417 --> 01:49:54,334
Have you considered the severity
of the sentence for such crimes?

1153
01:50:14,209 --> 01:50:15,042
Hey.

1154
01:50:18,334 --> 01:50:19,334
Zheng Yi!

1155
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:21,375
The suspect cannot meet with the victim!

1156
01:50:21,459 --> 01:50:22,750
Zheng Yi!

1157
01:50:30,667 --> 01:50:33,584
Both of you have been lying
since the beginning!

1158
01:50:35,417 --> 01:50:38,084
Once we submit the report,
you won't ever see her again.

1159
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,042
I don't know him.

1160
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,584
Why don't we get to know each other now?

1161
01:50:51,792 --> 01:50:52,750
Chen Nian!

1162
01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:54,375
- Listen to me.
- Calm down.

1163
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:57,459
Can't you just trust me?

1164
01:50:57,542 --> 01:50:59,917
- Get up.
- Calm down, Zheng Yi!

1165
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:02,750
Do you really know what you're doing?

1166
01:51:02,834 --> 01:51:04,709
- Zheng Yi!
- Listen to me, Chen Nian!

1167
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,500
- Calm down.
- Just trust me.

1168
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:07,792
- Chen Nian.
- Zheng Yi.

1169
01:51:51,667 --> 01:51:53,417
You were protecting Chen Nian.

1170
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:57,042
Why are you suddenly accusing her
of murdering Wei Lai?

1171
01:51:59,584 --> 01:52:02,375
If someone spends decades
in prison for her,

1172
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,334
she won't be able to bear it.

1173
01:52:06,709 --> 01:52:09,375
No one would take the rap
for murder and rape

1174
01:52:09,459 --> 01:52:10,625
just to protect someone.

1175
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,792
We wouldn't,

1176
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:13,834
but they're teenagers.

1177
01:53:32,834 --> 01:53:34,167
What's wrong?

1178
01:53:36,334 --> 01:53:38,042
We shouldn't be seen together.

1179
01:53:39,042 --> 01:53:40,125
I don't mind.

1180
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,667
It's not that simple.

1181
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:45,334
Keep walking.

1182
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:47,084
I'll be right behind you.

1183
01:53:50,125 --> 01:53:51,375
What will you do behind me?

1184
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:53,584
Nothing.

1185
01:54:07,667 --> 01:54:11,084
HARD WORK SOWED YESTERDAY
WILL BE TODAY'S SUCCESSFUL REAP

1186
01:54:51,959 --> 01:54:54,625
ANQIAO CITY PRISON

1187
01:54:55,709 --> 01:54:57,709
The entrance exam results are out today.

1188
01:54:57,792 --> 01:54:59,917
- What's your score?
- First choice universities'

1189
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,209
entry score is 548.

1190
01:55:01,292 --> 01:55:02,875
- Next is 494.
- It's 632.

1191
01:55:02,959 --> 01:55:04,292
TOTAL SCORE

1192
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:06,125
How did you do so well?

1193
01:55:07,834 --> 01:55:09,000
How is it possible?

1194
01:55:10,042 --> 01:55:11,792
All of your efforts paid off.

1195
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:13,209
We made it.

1196
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:16,209
Good people get good karma. God bless.

1197
01:55:18,334 --> 01:55:19,709
Nian, I love you.

1198
01:55:21,209 --> 01:55:22,625
Mom loves you.

1199
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:25,709
Let's eat!

1200
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,542
Keep quiet, I'll go check.

1201
01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:00,334
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1202
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:06,834
I was nearby.

1203
01:56:07,334 --> 01:56:08,792
I came by to congratulate you.

1204
01:56:14,542 --> 01:56:15,542
You're free now.

1205
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,959
How do you feel?

1206
01:56:21,709 --> 01:56:23,500
I'm talking about becoming an adult.

1207
01:56:24,334 --> 01:56:25,209
How does it feel?

1208
01:56:27,542 --> 01:56:29,375
You're not going to talk to me anymore?

1209
01:56:29,875 --> 01:56:30,917
I understand.

1210
01:56:31,625 --> 01:56:34,125
You're still mad at me for suspecting you.

1211
01:56:34,959 --> 01:56:37,500
I was disciplined for what happened.

1212
01:56:44,959 --> 01:56:46,250
I'll go then.

1213
01:56:48,125 --> 01:56:49,959
I'll see you off when you go to Beijing.

1214
01:57:00,084 --> 01:57:02,084
Right, I have good news for you.

1215
01:57:03,459 --> 01:57:04,709
A few days ago,

1216
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:07,042
Liu Beishan received a death sentence.

1217
01:57:12,459 --> 01:57:15,584
Due to the severity of his crimes
and his previous convictions,

1218
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:17,834
the court reached a quick verdict.

1219
01:57:19,959 --> 01:57:21,167
But he's a minor.

1220
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:22,792
He lied to you.

1221
01:57:23,417 --> 01:57:24,792
Liu Beishan is an adult.

1222
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:30,459
Even if he is a minor,
he has to bear legal responsibility.

1223
01:57:50,917 --> 01:57:51,917
Chen Nian.

1224
01:57:52,875 --> 01:57:53,709
Go away!

1225
01:57:53,917 --> 01:57:54,750
Go away!

1226
01:57:56,167 --> 01:57:57,167
Why?

1227
01:57:57,334 --> 01:57:58,959
Why can't you leave us alone?

1228
01:57:59,042 --> 01:58:02,084
Why is it so hard to let us be?

1229
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:03,834
Just let one of us be free.

1230
01:58:03,917 --> 01:58:07,875
Why did you do that? Why?

1231
01:58:08,917 --> 01:58:10,125
Leave!

1232
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:21,167
I'm sorry, I lied.

1233
01:58:21,584 --> 01:58:22,625
There's no verdict yet.

1234
01:58:22,709 --> 01:58:25,792
He'll be put away for decades,
but you could be out in a few years.

1235
01:58:27,167 --> 01:58:28,375
Hate me all you want.

1236
01:58:28,459 --> 01:58:30,167
This is for the good of both of you.

1237
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,625
Number 178, you have a visitor.

1238
02:02:16,709 --> 02:02:18,292
A good student...

1239
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,459
and a small-time punk.

1240
02:02:24,834 --> 02:02:26,667
Must you drag both of them down?

1241
02:02:30,084 --> 02:02:31,750
You've come a long way.

1242
02:02:51,584 --> 02:02:52,709
Where are you going?

1243
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:54,375
To sleep. I'm tired.

1244
02:03:16,042 --> 02:03:16,875
Bei.

1245
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:21,000
I feel much more relaxed now.

1246
02:03:22,875 --> 02:03:26,750
It's the same feeling I had
when I finished my last paper.

1247
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,084
Really?

1248
02:03:31,667 --> 02:03:33,667
Did your teacher's prediction come true?

1249
02:03:36,167 --> 02:03:37,000
Yes.

1250
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:39,334
What was the topic?

1251
02:03:41,125 --> 02:03:42,917
A letter to 20 years after.

1252
02:03:50,417 --> 02:03:51,542
Are you afraid?

1253
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:55,084
I used to be.

1254
02:03:55,584 --> 02:03:58,125
I'm still a little scared.

1255
02:03:59,292 --> 02:04:00,250
And you?

1256
02:04:03,084 --> 02:04:04,584
I was a little afraid,

1257
02:04:07,042 --> 02:04:08,125
but not anymore.

1258
02:04:15,709 --> 02:04:17,250
If you could go back,

1259
02:04:17,834 --> 02:04:19,375
would you do it all over again?

1260
02:04:28,625 --> 02:04:29,834
Answer me.

1261
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:37,250
There is no "if."

1262
02:04:39,084 --> 02:04:40,000
Besides,

1263
02:04:43,084 --> 02:04:45,000
I don't like the "if" in this scenario.

1264
02:05:33,375 --> 02:05:36,209
ANQIAO CITY NATIONAL COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM

1265
02:05:45,584 --> 02:05:46,834
MARKS MUST BE STANDARDIZED

1267

JIUPO, FUJIANG

1268
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:21,959
Does anyone know the difference
between "was" and "used to be"?

1269
02:07:24,042 --> 02:07:25,292
Anyone?

1270
02:07:25,834 --> 02:07:27,959
"Was" means it has passed.

1271
02:07:28,084 --> 02:07:30,125
In fact, both of them mean
that it has passed.

1272
02:07:30,209 --> 02:07:32,917
But the difference is that "used to be"

1273
02:07:33,084 --> 02:07:35,042
carries a sense of loss.

1274
02:07:36,042 --> 02:07:37,167
Understand?

1275
02:07:37,959 --> 02:07:39,542
Let's go over the sentences again.

1276
02:07:39,625 --> 02:07:41,459

1277
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:34,792
Bye.

1278

- Bye.
- Bye.

1279
02:09:39,042 --> 02:09:41,959
Chen Nian was found guilty
of negligent homicide

1280
02:09:42,042 --> 02:09:44,834
and received a light sentence
of four years in prison.

1281
02:09:44,917 --> 02:09:47,292
The case aroused great government
and public concern.

1282
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:50,959
It not only introduced heavier penalties
towards juveniles involved in bullying,

1283
02:09:51,042 --> 02:09:53,834
but also initiated the implementation
of a campus safety plan.

1284
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:55,417

1286
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,750
Bullying could be happening around us.

1287
02:09:59,834 --> 02:10:01,167
Effective January 1, 2013.

1288
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:05,750
Schools are at the frontline
of prevention against bullying.

1289
02:10:06,417 --> 02:10:09,209
However, school bullying
goes beyond campus walls.

1290
02:10:09,959 --> 02:10:13,500
In 2016, the Ministry of Education
and eight other ministries

1291
02:10:13,625 --> 02:10:16,417
implemented 11 initiatives
to curb bullying on campus,

1292
02:10:16,792 --> 02:10:21,125
including preventions, penalties,
and long-term deployments.

1293
02:10:22,959 --> 02:10:25,417
In November 2017,
the Ministry of Education

1294

municipal governments
introduced regulations

1298
02:10:36,042 --> 02:10:38,000
to prevent school bullying

1299
02:10:38,084 --> 02:10:40,417
in accordance
to the State Council's guidance.

1300
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:46,959
When family, society, the law
and every one of us

1301
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,250
come together to join forces,

1302
02:10:49,417 --> 02:10:52,500
we can protect our younger generations
and the world from bullies.

1303
02:15:25,167 --> 02:15:27,709
