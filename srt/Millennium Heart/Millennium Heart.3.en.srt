1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,640
Come and take a look.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,200
Sachet Sachet

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,280
Come and take a look.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,480
People don't live a long life.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Flowers don't last forever.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,440
I miss it so much.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,560
Think about the past.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,240
we could still

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,680
fly to the sky to see the stars.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,840
Sometimes I try

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,040
Snow lotus on the snow mountain.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,920
I can go to the old forest

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,760
to steal some monkey wine.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640
Unlike now,

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,280
living

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,560
living under someone's roof.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:41,840
Here we are.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,240
Young Master, you're here.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Sorry for not welcoming you.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,920
Please come in.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,920
God bless you.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,120
He’s the young master.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,239
Mr. Cheng, this fabric is so comfortable.

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:05,960
I like it.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,600
If you like it,

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll prepare two more for you.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,280
After all,

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,320
both of you have to follow me.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,560
Don’t dress too shabby.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,160
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,520
I’m done.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,000
Why do I feel

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,480
familiar?

34
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,520
Extra meat

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,680
You look like a dog.

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,280
Sure.

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Lin.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,039
So beautiful.

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,400
That's...

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,120
What do you think?

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,759
What does that mean?

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
What do you think?

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,640
The Tianyuxiang clothes

44
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,280
is indeed top quality.

45
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,000
You don't even know how to praise people.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
I was born pretty.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
Someone has to do it.

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
It's pretty.

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,640
Thank you.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,600
Eldest Young Master.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
By the way, Eldest Young Master,

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,079
don’t you have a gift

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,560
for Miss Lin?

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,440
What gift?

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
I have something for her.

57
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
A gift?

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Why do you give me a gift?

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,720
You're being nice.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,480
You're a thief.

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,360
Look how scared you are.

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,160
This necklace is so pretty.

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,200
For me?

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,480
This necklace is not for you.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why are you so stingy?

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,079
I gave you my Internal Dan.

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,080
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,720
Is it pretty?

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,720
Thank you.

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,560
Stop looking.

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,160
Let's go home.

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,560
Home?

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
I still have a lot of places to go.

74
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,040
Let's go, succulent meat.

75
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,120
Show me your necklace.

76
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,880
Young Master.

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,360
Shall we follow?

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Of course.

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Delicious and beautiful sugar painting.

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,840
Pancakes!

81
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,880
Pancakes for sale!

82
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,600
Do you have any money?

83
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,800
No.

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,520
What are you doing?

85
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,120
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:28,960
Succulent meat.

87
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,200
Coming.

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Female bandits.

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,640
Boss, five.

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,079
Okay.

91
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,640
Take it.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
Sugar painting.

93
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,560
No.

94
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,360
Take it.

95
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
I don't eat sweets.

96
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,079
Fresh steamed buns

97
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,720
Buns

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
It smells like steamed buns.

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,720
Stop.

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
This is quite interesting.

101
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,000
Miss.

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,160
I think I saw Mr. Cheng.

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Does this look like you?

104
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,640
Look.

105
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,159
Miss.

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,200
Shall we

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,560
say hello to Mr. Cheng?

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,520
Mingxiang.

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
No need.

110
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,760
Yes.

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
Put that back.

112
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,880
Why?

113
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,720
Doesn't it look good?

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,640
I think it's okay.

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,200
Not bad.

116
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Take a look.

117
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,680
Fresh.

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
cosmetics.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,440
Hurry up.

120
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,120
Mr. Feng.

121
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,640
Miss Zhou.

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,680
You are here.

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,840
I heard a batch of

124
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,640
new clothes.

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,480
I’m here to have a look.

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Miss Zhou.

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,040
Sorry.

128
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,160
Just now,

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,040
the fabrics were bought

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,160
by Mr. Cheng.

131
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
You're so silly.

132
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,280
What Miss wants

133
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,560
for women?

134
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,280
Yes.

135
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,880
I'm talking about women.

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
He bought women's clothes.

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,480
Yes.

138
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Mr. Cheng

139
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
brought a woman here.

140
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
She was wearing a dress.

141
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,600
She likes it very much.

142
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,520
Young Master

143
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
bought all the clothes.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,520
Miss Zhou,

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,440
Didn't you just eat

146
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
six buns.

147
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,159
Only six. That's not enough.

148
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,159
There's no meat here.

149
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
I'll go to the kitchen.

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,720
What kind of monster is he?

151
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,520
Why is he so edible?

152
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,880
Could it be Pi?

153
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,120
Stop talking nonsense.

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,040
That Pi is an ancient mythical beast.

155
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,120
And succulent meat

156
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,840
It's just a jade bowl that has become a spirit.

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,920
He used it

158
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,880
to display tribute.

159
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,400
No matter how many things are in it,

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,040
you can only smell it but can't eat it.

161
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
So when you become a spirit,

162
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,960
you have to eat it back doubly.

163
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,920
Bowl

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,880
This can become a spirit?

165
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Normally,

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
I don't think so

167
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,360
But succulent meat

168
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,200
some kind of practice.

169
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,440
and got a blessed opportunity.

170
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,520
and became a spirit.

171
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,520
So I'm an exception.

172
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,600
I didn't expect

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,000
you are here too.

174
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
This lady is so pretty.

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
I've never seen her before.

176
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
A spring vacation has passed.

177
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,159
You haven't improved much.

178
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,560
Yes.

179
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,080
Of course I'm not as good as you.

180
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
Since young,

181
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,680
he's better at writing and writing poems than me.

182
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Now,

183
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
I can't do it

184
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
I can't do it.

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
Cousin?

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,920
Yes.

187
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,000
I think you should

188
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,680
three slaps

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,880
to show your respect to your brother.

190
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,480
What are you waiting for?

191
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,080
What?

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,280
Do you want me to fan it for you?

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,520
Who are you?

194
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
Who are you to tell me what to do?

195
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,840
What's wrong with Young Master?

196
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,640
I don't know.

197
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,800
Why did he slap himself?

198
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,640
Is he possessed?

199
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,040
Evil?

200
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,040
Who are you?

201
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,440
I...

202
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm your cousin.

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,720
Don't you remember?

204
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,600
In the future,

205
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
if I see you

206
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,360
see you talking nonsense,

207
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
it's not just

208
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,560
just slap your face.

209
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,360
Got it?

210
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
Greet me now.

211
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,280
Hello, cousin.

212
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,960
Master.

213
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,960
We found a trace of Jun Xu in the city.

214
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,039
Got it.

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,280
I think it’s okay now.

216
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
Maybe you can use magic

217
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
you can use magic.

218
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
It's possible.

219
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
But I hope

220
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,920
my Internal Dan

221
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
can recover his body soon,

222
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,120
so that it can come back earlier.

223
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
Why are you using these magic again?

224
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
What do you mean by witchcraft?

225
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
This is not

226
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,120
evil tricks.

227
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,800
I don't care.

228
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,600
In my mansion,

229
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,520
you must obey

230
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,200
the rules of my mansion.

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,600
We are demons and you are humans.

232
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
We have different paths, understand?

233
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,360
You have to learn

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,360
like me.

235
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,640
I know.

236
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,800
You're scared.

237
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
You're afraid we'll implicate

238
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,880
Young Master Cheng.

239
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,880
Right.

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
You hid me

241
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,000
and colluded with demons.

242
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,680
The combination of these two

243
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
are enough for you to suffer for the rest of your life.

244
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
It's not a big deal to starve to death.

245
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
Losing integrity is important.

246
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,000
Right?

247
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,560
As expected, fairies have evil intentions.

248
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,120
You...

249
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,080
You're educated.

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Why are you so rude?

251
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you okay?

252
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,080
You have no manners.

253
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,960
and read people's mind.

254
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,440
You...

255
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,200
I...

256
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,320
Mr. Cheng.

257
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Lin is not that kind of person.

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,680
Not such a demon.

259
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Lin.

260
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,680
Calm down. Don't fight.

261
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,480
Don't talk.

262
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
If you want to live among humans,

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
you have to be polite and shameless.

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
So you mean

265
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,080
I'm shameless?

266
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
You are simply

267
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,840
with a villain's heart.

268
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,400
You...

269
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,000
Mr. Cheng, your face...

270
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,960
It’s because of that demon.

271
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,720
We're not compatible.

272
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,680
I've been

273
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,400
in fear all day long.

274
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,680
Just give way to that girl.

275
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,560
Xu,

276
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,400
You don't know.

277
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,400
That demon...

278
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,640
She's violent.

279
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,680
and sharp-tongued.

280
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,720
and extremely despicable.

281
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,200
is not something

282
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
can tolerate.

283
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,560
I just want her

284
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,120
leave me soon.

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,600
and give me peace.

286
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,920
Although Lin is a demon,

287
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,640
I haven’t seen him

288
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
as you said.

289
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,680
So,

290
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
if she really wanted to harm you,

291
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,320
she would have done that.

292
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Right?

293
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,200
What's wrong?

294
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,520
Wake up.

295
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
You must be fine.

296
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,480
If anything happens to you,

297
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
I don't have the Internal Dan to save you.

298
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
Demons are the same as humans.

299
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,080
Humans are good and evil.

300
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
There are also good and bad demons.

301
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
In your opinion,

302
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,640
they...

303
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,960
are good demons.

304
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,400
After what you said,

305
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,920
they are

306
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,840
are not that bad.

307
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,720
But that Lin

308
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,720
changed a lot.

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
It really scares me.

310
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
Lin has always been like this.

311
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
It seems that you

312
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
know her well.

313
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,840
Mr. Xu.

314
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,640
Please.

315
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,600
Young Master.

316
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,080
By the way,

317
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm here

318
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
to check on your health.

319
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Have you changed recently?

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,960
I feel my energy

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,560
much better recently.

322
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
But how long

323
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,120
in my body?

324
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,320
At least a few months.

325
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,320
or a few years.

326
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
A few years?

327
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,280
I can't wait.

328
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,880
I can't wait one more day.

329
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
This Internal Dan is also a bead

330
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,320
that absorbs the energy of heaven and earth.

331
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,680
How does it work?

332
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,760
How to work?

333
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,400
depends on how you cooperate with it.

334
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,520
Is there any way

335
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,960
accelerate

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
the recovery of the Internal Dan?

337
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,920
Skin kiss.

338
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,080
Except this,

339
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,280
Is there any other way?

340
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,960
any other way?

341
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,600
If you can control the Internal Dan,

342
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,480
you can cultivate on your own.

343
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,840
But the Internal Dan

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
has been following Lin.

345
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,760
I want it to listen to me.

346
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,960
to make it obedient.

347
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,320
Do you have

348
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,520
to cultivate?

349
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,880
Let me try.

350
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,080
Brother Cheng.

351
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,160
Have you made up your mind?

352
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
You will never give up

353
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,320
give up halfway.

354
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,280
Otherwise,

355
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
not only can you not control the Internal Dan,

356
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,560
your condition will get worse.

357
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,120
Xu,

358
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,960
Since I've made up my mind,

359
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
I will definitely do it.

360
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,160
That's good.

361
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,400
What do you think?

362
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,680
I've never felt this before.

363
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,120
It's like

364
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,920
floating in the sky.

365
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,080
Remember this feeling.

366
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,440
I feel your body

367
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,160
getting better.

368
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,120
It's just that I'm not strong enough.

369
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
What should I do?

370
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
I'll send you

371
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
to control the Internal Dan.

372
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,280
When the Yang energy rises every day,

373
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,520
you can train.

374
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,400
Okay.

375
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,720
Hold your breath and focus.

376
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
Put all your energy

377
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,680
into your energy.

378
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,520
This is Dantian.

379
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,160
Hands flat.

380
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,160
Push on both sides.

381
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,840
What are they doing?

382
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,800
Pushing the energy of your energy to your body.

383
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,400
Do you feel

384
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,160
rising energy?

385
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,360
No.

386
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
It's okay. Let's do it again.

387
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,200
Okay.

388
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,640
Yuli.

389
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,800
Come here.

390
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,960
Thank you.

391
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,520
Don't worry.

392
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,840
I will help you recover.

393
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Have you found them?

394
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,560
I've set up

395
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,320
in Lincheng.

396
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
And I found

397
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,840
there seems to be divine power inside.

398
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,200
I think...

399
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,480
It's almost done.

400
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,240
Okay.

401
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,320
Okay. Okay.

402
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,520
Looks like

403
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
we can meet again soon.

404
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,960
These

405
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,520
are for you.

406
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
We...

407
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,920
People don't study.

408
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,440
the sun will be in the secular world.

409
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,960
In two days, you look in the mirror and look hateful.

410
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,040
In three days, it's boring to talk to people.

411
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,599
Are you kidding me?

412
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
I've been in Jianghu for thousands of years.

413
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,480
I've seen everything.

414
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,080
Who are you to lecture me?

415
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,560
It's so funny.

416
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,480
When the academy starts,

417
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,520
If you're willing to go with me,

418
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
you can read them.

419
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
After all, it must be difficult

420
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,720
to let a female thief study.

421
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
Are you looking down on me?

422
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,720
What?

423
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,800
I can memorize

424
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,680
when I was three.

425
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,680
Could it be

426
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
a demon

427
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
a millennium demon?

428
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,880
Lin.

429
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,320
If you don’t make a living,

430
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,560
Don't let this arrogant kid

431
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,520
look down on you.

432
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,520
Okay.

433
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,880
I'll read it.
