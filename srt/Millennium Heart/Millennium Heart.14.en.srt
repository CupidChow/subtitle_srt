1
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,120
My body.

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,440
How did it go?

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,480
I think

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,160
I think he's suitable.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
But I still need to take care of him for a few days.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,720
Good.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,600
By the way, Your Highness,

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,640
I have good news for you.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,360
I found them.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,600
I really miss them.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,520
Don't worry.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,800
I think

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,360
they are in love now.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,280
I have the Internal Dan of Shamo.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,840
Although Ao Qi's Internal Dan

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,960
has returned,

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,120
it won't be long.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,840
they will be used by us.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
Once we find the book,

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,480
we'll succeed.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,400
Well done.

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,120
Ao Qi.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,240
Ni Mo.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,520
This time,

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,400
I won't give you

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,640
any chance.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,440
Let's go.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,360
I don't want to

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,960
stay here anymore.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm leaving now.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,560
Are you and Cheng Qi

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,240
with Cheng Qi?

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,200
I can help you.

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,160
Say what?

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,680
It's up to you.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,160
Where are you going?

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,720
Where am I going?

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,080
Why should I tell you?

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
You can't leave yet.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
I have something to tell you.

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,800
Come to my room.

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,920
Why?

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,520
What do you mean why?

45
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,640
Why should I

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
listen to him?

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,880
He didn't take my Internal Dan.

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,560
Aren't you going to give it back?

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,600
Sit down.

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,240
No need.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Just say it.

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
I have to go.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,560
Where are you going?

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
Anywhere.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,320
Get out of here.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Leave this place.

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,880
and never see you again.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,640
Don't go.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,800
Do you hate me that much?

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,240
Except leaving,

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,960
other than leaving?

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,200
Jun Xu told me everything.

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,200
I can't let you die

64
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,800
just for an Internal Dan.

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,480
I don't want you to leave.

66
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,320
There's no use running away now.

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I need your cooperation.

68
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,160
Trust me.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Greetings, Miss Zhou.

70
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
Thank you, Mr. Li.

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,920
Please have a seat.

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,720
Please.

73
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,120
Miss Zhou, do you want to see me today?

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
to meet me today?

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
I haven't seen Mr. Li

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,720
in the arena recently.

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,680
You must be too busy.

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,120
Recently, Ningyuan became a master.

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400
That's why he's been cultivating

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,400
in his mansion.

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,720
So,

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,480
what do you think about

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,960
you must be confident

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,240
must be confident.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,280
I don't dare to say anything.

86
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,159
This is not like Mr. Li.

87
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Mr. Li.

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,600
because of Mr. Cheng?

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,680
Mr. Cheng

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
is really strange.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
In martial arts,

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,560
in martial arts.

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
But recently,

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,200
seems to be getting more and more successful.

95
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Don't you think

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,400
strange?

97
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,760
Good tea.

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
But Mr. Cheng

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,320
is not right.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,480
After all, he is

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,400
our old classmate.

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,400
But those newcomers

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,560
are all

104
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,560
all weird.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Miss Zhou, do you think something is wrong?

106
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
That day in the arena,

107
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,320
Mr. Li made a fool of himself.

108
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
I think

109
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Cheng Lin is doing it on purpose.

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,440
I’m not afraid that Mr. Li will laugh at me.

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,159
Even a weak woman like me

112
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
I've been feeling weird lately.

113
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,240
He kept making a fool of himself in the academy.

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I was neglected and criticized.

115
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
I've never

116
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,280
I've never

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
such a big grievance.

118
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,520
On the contrary,

119
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
since they entered the school,

120
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,880
strange things happened frequently.

121
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
and never had peace.

122
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
It's the first time

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
this is the first time

124
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
such a thing.

125
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,200
And somehow,

126
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,720
at this time.

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,360
It seems that Miss Zhou

128
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,880
like me,

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
like me.

130
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,880
Do you have

131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,200
any idea?

132
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,240
A way?

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Of course I have.

134
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,440
Mr. Li,

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,360
Is it really possible?

136
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,200
Don’t worry, Miss Zhou.

137
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Master Yuli is famous.

138
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,360
She can solve everything.

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,760
Besides,

140
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
with her help,

141
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,920
whatever Miss Zhou does in the future,

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,560
in the future.

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
Have you been

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
rest well lately?

145
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
I don’t think so.

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,560
Since I followed Master Yuli

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,280
with Master Yuli,

148
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
I think my body

149
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,720
and spirit

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
are very good.

151
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,880
Master Yuli.

152
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
I am Zhou Jingyan.

153
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,480
Greetings, Master Yuli.

154
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,680
Come here.

155
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
I need you to promise me a few things.

156
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't worry.

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,520
What I want you to do

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,920
to make things difficult for you.

159
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,760
Please go ahead.

160
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
Since you can help me fulfill my wish,

161
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
I will repay you twice.

162
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,240
Only the three of us

163
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,360
what happened today.

164
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,400
If word gets out,

165
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
all of you

166
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,320
in the future.

167
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,360
Okay.

168
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,880
Besides,

169
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
get close to Mr. Cheng

170
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,360
and make him like you.

171
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,720
This...

172
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,760
is also your wish.

173
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,480
But I’m afraid Mr. Cheng

174
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,440
to me.

175
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,560
Don't worry.

176
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,000
I will help you.

177
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Thank you, Master Yuli.

178
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
Thank you, Master Yuli.

179
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,080
The internal selection

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,560
starts today.

181
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,160
I hope all the students

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,880
can participate

183
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,280
and get good grades.

184
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,880
and bring glory to Lin City Academy.

185
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,800
In this competition,

186
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,640
Deeducation.

187
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,920
Ji education.

188
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,280
Sports.

189
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
Sports and sound sports.

190
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Five aspects.

191
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,120
Five competitions.

192
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,600
the winners

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
will represent the scholars

194
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,280
on behalf of Lincheng Academy.

195
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,280
officially.

196
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,040
That's great.

197
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,080
On behalf of the academy.

198
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,880
So,

199
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
I hope you can prepare well

200
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,920
and get the best result.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,320
Go?

202
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,560
I want to participate in sports.

203
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,520
You?

204
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
Can you do it?

205
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
We need to practice.

206
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,200
This is too hard.

207
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,560
Let's go.

208
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,120
Okay.

209
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,320
Does this mean virtue?

210
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,560
But how can you take the exam like this?

211
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,440
Yeah

212
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,240
It's not like I'm learning.

213
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
If the writing

214
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,960
is different from

215
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,480
your true self.

216
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,440
What should we do?

217
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,720
I also heard that

218
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,880
the results of

219
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,480
the result was unexpected.

220
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,840
Some winners

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,480
don't even know

222
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
don't know why they won.

223
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,800
So mysterious.

224
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,040
It's quite interesting.

225
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,880
Wait for me.

226
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,400
Sure.

227
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,800
Come on.

228
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,960
Mr. Xian.

229
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,160
How can you

230
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,000
what you did?

231
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,280
Let's take a look.

232
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,040
In front of so many people today,

233
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,720
Let go of me!

234
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
Let's go.

235
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,080
Let's go.

236
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,080
Mr. Xian.

237
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,960
What did I do?

238
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Who are you? Let go!

239
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,840
What are they doing?

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,560
Students, please be the judge.

241
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
I only performed.

242
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,440
This gentleman said

243
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,080
he would marry me officially and marry me into the mansion.

244
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,040
That's why I obey you.

245
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,320
Now I'm pregnant.

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
Even if you don't care about me,

247
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,160
even if you don't care about me.

248
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,520
I don't know her at all.

249
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,920
Don't believe it.

250
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,640
This classmate is really amazing.

251
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,800
The love debt

252
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
for this love debt.

253
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,480
That's right.

254
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,400
The academy is quiet.

255
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
They are pulling each other here.

256
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,160
How inappropriate!

257
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,560
It's a disgrace

258
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,120
the dignity of a scholar.

259
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,240
By the way,

260
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
the baby

261
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
might be someone's.

262
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,160
Don't believe

263
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,000
what she said.

264
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,480
Yes.

265
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,960
Exactly.

266
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,640
It's not true.

267
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,360
Go away.

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
How can you discuss it so openly?

269
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,760
A woman

270
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,640
That's too much.

271
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,560
I don't think this woman

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,320
lying.

273
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,520
He still doesn't admit it.

274
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,000
Miss, please get up.

275
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Take it easy.

276
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,240
Hey,

277
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,320
please be the judge.

278
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
This woman wants to blame me

279
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
and humiliated me.

280
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,440
How could I marry her?

281
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,120
That's right.

282
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,640
Yes.

283
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,080
We believe him.

284
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,920
It's not like that.

285
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,440
It's really not like that.

286
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Please believe me.

287
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,600
She must be lying.

288
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,040
That's right.

289
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,680
Alright.

290
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,600
Stop it.

291
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
What happened

292
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,760
of this matter.

293
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,400
I believe we can know

294
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,160
if we investigate.

295
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,520
But you

296
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
are all scholars.

297
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,480
How dare you treat

298
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,080
pregnant woman

299
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
How dare you

300
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Who are you to blame us?

301
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,120
Do you know her?

302
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,760
You're not involved.

303
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,320
That's right.

304
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
You sound like it has something to do with us.

305
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,680
It must be her fault.

306
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,320
She went too far.

307
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,120
Lincheng Academy has never allowed

308
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,760
outsiders to enter.

309
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,000
There must be

310
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,680
other arrangements.

311
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Let's wait and see.

312
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,520
How inappropriate!

313
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,400
Enough!

314
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,640
I really don't know her.

315
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,440
Who knows this woman?

316
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,880
and who has seen

317
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,600
what happened to them?

318
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
You don't know him or know him.

319
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,520
Why are you blaming me?

320
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,240
All of you

321
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,880
are students of Lincheng Academy.

322
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
They are all well-educated.

323
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,360
It's ridiculous.

324
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,360
Brother Hongli.

325
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,040
It's obvious that

326
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
she's a prostitute.

327
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
So what?

328
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,480
A prostitute ate your rice?

329
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,160
You judge this person

330
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,120
based on one's occupation.

331
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,040
the morality of this person.

332
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,960
Divide a person

333
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,320
into three, six, nine.

334
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,800
Self-righteous.

335
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,000
standing on the moral high point,

336
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
you can criticize me.

337
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,480
Have you ever earned a penny?

338
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,720
Why do you think

339
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,520
more noble than others?

340
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,640
Everything is inferior.

341
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,840
Only with high education

342
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,320
You can

343
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
for me.

344
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
Please accept my gift.

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,720
Don't stand on ceremony.

346
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,720
Miss.

347
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,160
Don't take

348
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,520
what they said.

349
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,520
Sure.

350
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,120
The teacher is here.

351
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
You can teach me.

352
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
You can teach me.

353
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
Mr. Yu.

354
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,200
Mr. Yu.

355
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
This woman defamed me.

356
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,920
and insulted my reputation.

357
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,240
This classmate

358
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
is still defending her.

359
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,080
Please understand.

360
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,800
You...

361
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,040
Mr. Yu.

362
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,160
I don't know

363
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,480
what happened between them.

364
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,680
That's why I couldn't tell you.

365
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,280
about the truth.

366
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,440
and who is right.

367
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,760
But the reason why

368
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,600
stand here today

369
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,120
because I can't accept

370
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
who read the books of sages every day.

371
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,160
How dare you

372
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,360
to a pregnant woman.

373
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,880
and judge the truth

374
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,520
without asking what happened.

375
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,680
It has been hard for ten years.

376
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,040
One day, he passed the exam.

377
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,120
Everyone,

378
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
You always talk nonsense.

379
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Why do you become so biased

380
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,680
in real life?

381
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
There's no distinction between professions and nobility.

382
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
Poverty cannot be distinguished.

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,240
the moral of a person.

384
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,320
If you

385
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,400
If you become officials,

386
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,760
how can we ensure peace?

387
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
He went too far.

388
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,960
Fine.

389
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,840
Well said.

390
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,640
I was careless.

391
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,320
like a sword.

392
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,160
Wise words.

393
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
as good as medicine for the world.

394
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
As the saying goes,

395
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,280
Don't go after a promise.

396
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm in a hurry.

397
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,080
So I can't speak ill of you

398
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,440
You can't keep your words in your ears.

399
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,520
This is called a gentleman.

400
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,920
Hong Li.

401
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,160
You can be

402
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,240
one of the representatives of Lincheng Academy

403
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
to attend the gentleman's meeting.

404
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,440
I...

405
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,400
This...

406
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
This is an exam

407
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,080
Yes it's an exam

408
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,800
There's no telling.

409
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
A gentleman is ashamed.

410
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,040
From now on,

411
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,520
the pillar of the country.

412
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
Remember,

413
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,640
One word is right and the world rules.

414
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,840
One word shall rule the world.

415
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes, sir.

416
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,920
Congratulations.

417
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
It turns out they're the same.

418
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,920
I see.

419
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,560
They are acting.

420
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,080
Mr. Yu.

421
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,760
This is the exam of ethics.

422
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,880
We can't use an article

423
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,920
and comments.

424
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,720
So,

425
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,920
we invited

426
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,320
the two masters

427
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,520
to cooperate with us

428
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,680
to complete this test.

429
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,320
No wonder.

430
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,160
Yes.

431
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,880
Please.

432
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,280
Please.

433
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,720
It's so fake.

434
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,600
I didn't expect

435
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,280
Really.

436
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,080
It's a test.

437
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
Not bad, Hongli.

438
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,160
Stinky carp.

439
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,840
I've never seen

440
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,680
you are so brave.

441
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,520
I don't know why.

442
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm so lucky today.

443
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,800
So you knew it.

444
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,840
Since Hongli went up,

445
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,320
don't go up.

446
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,000
After all, only one person

447
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,400
can only choose one person.

448
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,560
Hong Li.

449
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,800
He wants to represent the academy so badly.

450
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,200
Let him go.
