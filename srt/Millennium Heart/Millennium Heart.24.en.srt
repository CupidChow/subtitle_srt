1
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
Stop drinking.

2
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
Who won the sword battle today?

3
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,400
Do you want to know?

4
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,880
It's a secret I can't tell you.

5
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,280
So you're all here.

6
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I've been looking for you.

7
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,480
It's been a few days.

8
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
You've grown taller, Yoko.

9
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
Who are you calling Xiaoye?

10
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm a nine-tailed Phoenix Fairy.

11
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,880
How can I be laughed at by you all the time?

12
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,840
Look at Jun Xu.

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
He never laughed at me.

14
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,680
By the way,

15
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,920
I found

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,720
a good place in the mortal world.

17
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,560
Let's go together.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Okay.

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,120
Sure.

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Let’s go, Yuli.

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,120
Look.

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Isn't this place

23
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
for training?

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,640
I didn't expect

25
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,600
there would be such a cave in the mortal world.

26
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,960
How did you find out?

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
Don't you know who I am?

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm Fengxian.

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,040
What's so great about Fengxian?

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm the Crown Prince.

31
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,040
Then is Jun Xu or Fairy Crane?

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,280
Maintain the balance of the Three Realms.

33
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,079
are all immortals.

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,480
What's wrong?

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,520
Am I wrong?

36
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,120
Right.

37
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,600
It's too quiet here.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,320
Jun Xu.

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,160
How about we play a game of Go?

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,320
What about Shamo?

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,440
You guys go play Go.

42
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,320
I'll go practice the piano.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,680
You should practice

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,920
you should practice.

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Yuli.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,200
Let’s go practice.

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,320
No.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,880
You guys go ahead.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,960
I have something to do. I'll get going.

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,880
Could it be...

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,080
we were immortals in the last life?

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
Cheng Qi is the dragon's son.

53
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,720
and Fairy Crane.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,959
And I...

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Fengxian.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Is the confidant you just mentioned

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
also a woman?

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,159
You haven't seen each other for a long time?

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,760
Where is she now?

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,840
She...

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,680
is far away

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,440
is right in front of me.

63
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,480
Tell me.

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,480
What did you do to her?

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
I entrusted her to you.

66
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
How could you bully her?

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,720
Lin.

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Is the one Jun Xu likes

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,080
is me?

70
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,680
Lin.

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,320
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
We've been looking for you.

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,080
We thought you were lost.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,520
Miss Lin,

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
Did you sleep well last night?

76
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Yes.

77
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,000
That's good.

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,280
I prepared some food.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,560
Let's eat together.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,920
No, it's okay.

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,960
We're leaving.

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,400
Let's go.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Yeah.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,920
Where are you going?

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm starving.

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,159
Stop talking.

87
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,880
Just come with me.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Mr. Xu

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,520
is kind.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Home is better.

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,400
The air is nice and quiet.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,400
Right

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,960
Sorry, succulent meat.

94
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,680
I made you suffer.

95
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,320
It's okay.

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
But why

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,840
end up like this?

98
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,160
I don't know.

99
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm so confused right now.

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,880
What is it?

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,960
Don't worry.

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
Even if the whole world

103
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,800
abandoned you,

104
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,880
I still have succulent meat.

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
I will always be with you.

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
But Lin,

107
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,440
what are we eating tonight?

108
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,000
Don’t worry.

109
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
As long as I have a bite,

110
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,200
I won’t

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I won't let you eat more meat.

112
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,560
Okay.

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,360
Shrimp, Xie.

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,120
Eldest Young Master.

115
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Eldest Young Master.

116
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,080
Get me a horse.

117
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
I need to go to the temple.

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
No, no.

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,680
Although Miss Lin abandoned you,

120
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,480
and left you,

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,920
you don't need to be a monk.

122
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,080
That's right.

123
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,920
Young Master.

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,520
There are plenty of flowers in the world.

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,520
Why did you find that demon?

126
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
There aren't many.

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,040
And it has a bad reputation.

128
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,680
Who said I'm going to become a monk?

129
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,480
Lin said

130
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,600
she lived in a temple

131
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
living in the same temple.

132
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,560
So I must find her

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,880
and make it clear to her.

134
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,680
You have no idea

135
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,280
how important she is to me.

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
Remember to bring more money.

137
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,240
If she doesn't want to

138
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,280
come back with us,

139
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,240
we can't let her

140
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,520
suffer from hunger outside.

141
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't just stand there. Let's go.

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
You know what?

143
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,640
I heard that

144
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,120
on the engagement day,

145
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,000
on the engagement day

146
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,280
in the pavilion.

147
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes.

148
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Rumors are spreading in the mansion.

149
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
I also heard that woman

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
the daughter of Zhou Mang, Minister of Personnel.

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,680
Zhou Jing Yan.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,440
This young master

153
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,800
looks aloof,

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
I didn't expect you to be such a player.

155
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,400
You're right.

156
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,040
But why do I feel that

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,840
Young Master and the daughter of the Zhou family

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,760
are more suitable.

159
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,760
Young master.

160
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,120
Let's go.

161
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,640
Our young master is a loyal man.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,799
Why should they

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
comment?

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
You talk too much.

165
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,600
Young master.

166
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,799
I said it wrong.

167
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Lin.

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,960
You are the best.

169
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,160
With our condition,

170
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,040
we can eat and drink.

171
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Here, try my soup.

172
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,360
I told you.

173
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm here.

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,760
you'll have a lot of meat.

175
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
I think

176
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,040
Maybe it's going to rain.

177
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,840
Looks like the rain is heavy

178
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,160
Look at this door, succulent meat.

179
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay.

180
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
Don't sleep tonight.

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,440
Mine.

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Forget about the meat. The door is important.

183
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,640
It's raining so heavily.

184
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,280
I wonder how Lin is doing.

185
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,760
Shrimp, Xie.

186
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,880
Hurry up.

187
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
Yes, Young Master.

188
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Xie, faster!

189
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,000
What happened?

190
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,000
Young Master.

191
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,000
The wheels are stuck in the mud.

192
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,600
Shrimp

193
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,360
Push harder.

194
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,280
I've tried my best.

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,640
Eldest Young Master.

196
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,280
Eldest Young Master.

197
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,920
Why are you down?

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,640
It's raining heavily.

199
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
in such a heavy rain.

200
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,960
How can I

201
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,040
to my parents?

202
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,240
But the carriage

203
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
can't get out even if it's stuck here.

204
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,960
It's not far ahead.

205
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,880
Let's walk.

206
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,040
Young Master.

207
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,840
This...

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Forget about the carriage. Let's go.

209
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
I can't live anymore.

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,520
You can't enter Cheng Mansion.

211
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,240
I can't go to Jun Xu's place either.

212
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,320
I must

213
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,480
die in this shabby temple tonight.

214
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,200
Do you think

215
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,000
is Cheng Qi really that kind of person?

216
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,640
What kind of person?

217
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,200
Ungrateful.

218
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,600
A playboy.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,360
Wait.

220
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
Is this how you use

221
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,560
Is this how you use it?

222
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,320
It doesn't matter.

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,920
I mean,

224
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,000
how could he be so ungrateful

225
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,760
and hurt you so much?

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
How would I know

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,960
Cheng Qi is?

228
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,280
I think

229
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,440
it must be Zhou Jing Yan.

230
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Look at her

231
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
when she flatters Cheng Qi.

232
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
is obviously problematic.

233
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,960
Tell me.

234
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
was it too dark that day?

235
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,720
Cheng Qi had poor eyesight

236
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
and drunk.

237
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
Maybe he mistook

238
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Joo Jeong Yeon?

239
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,440
I mistook her for me.

240
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,360
What are you looking at?

241
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
Where is this place?

242
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,080
Why is it so dark?

243
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,360
Yes.

244
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,760
When it gets dark,

245
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,160
he has bad eyesight.

246
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,640
In that case,

247
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,600
I misunderstood him.

248
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,640
Did he really

249
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,680
as me?

250
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,600
So...

251
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,840
what he said that day

252
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,880
not to others.

253
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,120
but to me.

254
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,440
Am I right?

255
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,840
Yes.

256
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,920
You're always right.

257
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I haven't finished yet.

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,000
Succulent meat.

260
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,120
Succulent meat.

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,520
Can you chat with me for a while?

262
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
It's fine if you don't want to.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,080
Why are you angry?

264
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,680
I wonder

265
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
Cheng Qi is doing now.

266
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Young Master.

267
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,480
It should be here.

268
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,320
Lin.

269
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,000
Lin.

270
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,760
Lin.

271
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,320
Cheng Qi.

272
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,000
Cheng Qi.

273
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Cheng Qi.

274
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:56,880
Young master.

275
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,600
Lin.

276
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,960
Lin.

277
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,280
Lin.

278
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,280
Lin.

279
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,040
Cheng Qi.

280
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,160
You...

281
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,280
What's wrong?

282
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,040
It's my fault.

283
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,800
But it's not what you saw.

284
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Trust me.

285
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,640
Cheng Qi.

286
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,040
You...

287
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,120
Lin.

288
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:52,920
Shrimp.

289
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,680
Call the doctor.

290
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay.

291
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,280
Succulent meat, Xie.

292
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,600
Send someone to pick us up.

293
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Okay.

294
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,520
Lin.

295
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,520
Wake up, Lin.

296
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,240
Doctor.

297
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,720
Is she all right?

298
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
The Frost Binding Form.

299
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,360
Weiyang is depressed.

300
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,960
the symptoms of cold and fever.

301
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,640
The three medicines I prescribed

302
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,840
can cure the evil

303
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,600
and expel the cold in her body.

304
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,840
I believe she will get better tomorrow.

305
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,280
Thank you, doctor.

306
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,680
Thank you, doctor.

307
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,760
You’re welcome.

308
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
I’ll leave now.

309
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,560
I'll take care of Lin tonight.

310
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,040
Go back and rest.

311
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
I think Lin

312
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,600
is lovesick.

313
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
If you're not here,

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,280
the patient won't recover.

315
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
If she wakes up at night,

316
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,440
don't provoke her.

317
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
You must talk to her.

318
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay.

319
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,400
I’m leaving.

320
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,760
Sorry, Lin.

321
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
You only care about me.

322
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,520
But I made you

323
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
so much grievances.

324
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Ao Qi.

326
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
Ao Qi.

327
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
If you hand over the divine memorandum today,

328
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,760
I can spare his life.

329
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,720
Shamo,

330
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Live well.
