1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,720
By the way,

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,720
You have to be wary of Lee Ning-won tomorrow.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,920
Lee Yeongwon.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,720
What is he doing?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,360
I don't know.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,400
But he came to me just now.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,240
He asked me to stall you tomorrow.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
I won't let you pass.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,320
I think

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,560
even if I don't participate in the competition tomorrow,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,160
he'll hurt you.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Thank you.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,920
Hello. Hello. Hello.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,960
Here.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,080
Cheers.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,320
What?

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,320
What's wrong?

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,680
What's with that face?

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,560
Joo Jeong-yeon decided to quit.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,320
She also asked us

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,600
to be wary of Li Ning Yuan.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,240
I quit.

23
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,520
Why?

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,680
You won't understand.

25
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,520
Actually, Joo Jeong-yeon is a good girl.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,880
She opened her heart to me today

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,800
with me today,

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
That means she's not a bad person.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,280
She was just blinded

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
for personal gain.

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,280
You guys drink first.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,360
I need to go to the toilet.

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,440
Look.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,759
Coming.

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,840
Coming.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
There are words on it.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
One quarter past nine.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,800
Five miles south of the city.

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
This is the place for the next exam.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,640
Hong Li.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
How did you find out?

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,480
This...

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
This...

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,880
That's what happened.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
It means the luminous pearl

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,240
will blossom in water.

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Not only water,

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
That's divine water.

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,720
Hong Li.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,040
Great.

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,480
Water.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
Divine Water.

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,520
It's... It's...

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
Is this urine?

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,920
I washed it clean.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,640
I washed it in the river for a long time.

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,200
Smell it if you don't believe me.

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Smell the succulent meat.

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,480
No.

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,440
You can smell it yourself.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,480
You have to smell it.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,840
No.

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,480
Hurry up.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,840
Just a moment.

65
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,240
Smell it.

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,920
Let me smell it.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,440
No.

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Congratulations, students.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
for finding the place.

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,320
Now you can team up freely

71
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,600
and enter the next game.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
You need to find

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
that can represent passing.

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,080
Attention.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
You only have one hour.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
If you can't find the token

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,360
in one hour,

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,520
will be eliminated.

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Good luck, students.

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Why only

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,839
one hour?

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
I wish I could see you again

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
at the end.

84
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,800
Let's go.

85
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:56,680
Be careful.

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,520
This village is strange.

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,640
Why is there no one here?

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,960
Calm down.

89
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
Let's play it by ear.

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,000
Please

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,920
Please show mercy and save us.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,120
There's no time to waste.

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Let's go.

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,240
Please save my mother.

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Come.

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,240
Madam, please get up.

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Get up first.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
What happened?

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
My mother was infected with the plague.

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Without the Magic Herb,

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,400
without the Immortal Herb.

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
Magic Herb?

103
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,920
It has never recorded

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,640
has never recorded the Magic Herb.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
It needs to be treated correctly.

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,400
Do you have any idea?

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,040
You're right.

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,960
Madam.

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
please take us

110
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
to see your mother.

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
Okay, this way please.

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,240
Come on.

113
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,840
Let's go.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,240
Lee Yeongwon.

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Just leave.

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,800
The key is in the tree cave

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,480
in the tree cave.

118
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Wait.

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,640
This plague may be contagious.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's take precautions.

121
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,480
The whole village

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,840
has been infected.

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Only

124
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,280
can survive.

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,159
A doctor told us

126
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,080
only the Magic Herb can cure it.

127
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,240
But they are afraid of infections.

128
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,440
They ran away.

129
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,720
A good man.

130
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,640
You are a Buddha.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Please help us.

132
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,159
Help me.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,720
Mother!

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,840
Are you okay?

135
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Hang in there.

136
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,840
Madam.

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,120
Don't worry.

138
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,240
I know what the Magic Herb looks like.

139
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
Since it's tuberculosis,

140
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,440
it will be cured.

141
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,080
Thank you. Thank you.

142
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,000
I didn't expect

143
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,080
you are so good at medicine.

144
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,160
How long has it been

145
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
and you know the root of the disease.

146
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
If you hadn't ruined my business,

147
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,400
I would be

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
in Lincheng City.

149
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,120
How about this?

150
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
You go find the Magic Herb.

151
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll stay

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
to cook some rice porridge for them.

153
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,320
Rice porridge?

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Where did you get the rice porridge?

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,760
My father said

156
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,800
when you go out,

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,320
People are made of steel.

158
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,159
I'm starving without a meal.

159
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,840
Hongli.

160
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,120
I just realised that

161
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,600
you're the real fool.

162
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,880
Let's go find the Magic Herb.

163
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,560
Be careful.

164
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,280
Okay.

165
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,600
Let's go.

166
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,800
Madam, where is the water?

167
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,080
It's in the room. Please come in.

168
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,160
How did you know

169
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
the herb?

170
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,960
Magic Herb?

171
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
I've never heard of it.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,440
Many years ago,

173
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
a kind lady

174
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
mistook me as a missing refugee.

175
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
she invited me to dinner.

176
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
But the next day,

177
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,040
the next day.

178
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,320
She saw it with her own eyes.

179
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,280
many people died.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
Later, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,520
found this herb

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,640
is called Magic Herb.

183
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,600
After decocting it into medicine,

184
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,440
it can save the whole village.

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
This Big Madam is very nice.

186
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,520
She's very nice to me too.

187
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,799
But

188
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,120
she took the medicine too late.

189
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,760
After taking care of other villagers,

190
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
he was right in front of me.

191
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,400
So I remember

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,560
very deeply.

193
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,280
Don't worry.

194
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,560
I won't let you

195
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
alone in this world

196
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,680
in this world alone.

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
I will face it with you.

198
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,760
Look.

199
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
Is that the Magic Herb?

200
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
You can see it from so far away?

201
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
Your eyes are so good.

202
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,040
You'll see.

203
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,560
Let's go.

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,840
It's really Magic Herb. Look.

205
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Let's take all these back.

206
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,440
Okay.

207
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,200
Take it slowly.

208
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
Here, take the medicine.

209
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,920
Thank you.

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Are you feeling better?

211
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,280
This is yours.

212
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,760
Thank you.

213
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,360
Here.

214
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,200
Thank you.

215
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,640
Time for your medicine.

216
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,440
Feeling better?

217
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,160
My saviors, the medicine is ready.

218
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Thank you.

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,920
Good boy.

220
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,840
Good boy.

221
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,200
Really.

222
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,960
Jin Sun.

223
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,440
Yes, thank you so much.

224
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
Thank you for taking care of us.

225
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,760
Thank you.

226
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,400
Did you put the wrong medicine?

227
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,440
No way.

228
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,640
Great!

229
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,560
Congratulations on passing the test.

230
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,760
Test?

231
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,560
A gentleman should

232
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,200
to worry about the world first.

233
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,720
and the world will be happy.

234
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,280
Having compassion

235
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,840
is the characteristic of a gentleman.

236
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
What you're looking for

237
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
is in Wuli Tree Cave in the south of the village.

238
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,760
The three of you should leave now.

239
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,280
Okay.

240
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
Great

241
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,960
Great

242
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
So everyone is fine.

243
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,920
Let's go now.

244
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,520
Let's go.

245
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,520
Thank you.

246
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Go ahead.

247
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,280
Thank you, kids.

248
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,080
Thank you.

249
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,160
Good kids.

250
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,000
Thank you.

251
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,760
Look.

252
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,640
Is it here?

253
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
Lin, try it.

254
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,280
My hands are too big.

255
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
I can't reach in.

256
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,920
I don't think so.

257
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,880
Here.

258
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,120
Like this

259
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,840
So amazing.

260
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,800
Let's go.

261
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,360
Let's go.

262
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,440
Let's go.

263
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,080
Look at the time.

264
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,040
It should be soon.

265
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,480
Yes.

266
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,280
Soon.

267
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,880
I'll be back soon.

268
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,280
Looks like this time,

269
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,760
the name of No.1 Academy

270
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,720
the name of No.1 Academy.

271
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
There is still hope

272
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
There's still hope this time.

273
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,360
I don't think so.

274
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,200
The name of No.1 Academy...

275
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,000
It seems that

276
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
Mr. Yu's

277
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,880
Lin City Academy.

278
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,680
I heard that

279
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,640
they have

280
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,680
many students.

281
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
The competition

282
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,840
is not over yet.

283
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,960
Don't jump to conclusions.

284
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,840
Look, he's back.

285
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,960
He's back.

286
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,800
Yes.

287
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,320
It's Lee Yeongwon.

288
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:56,960
Look.

289
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,040
A student from Lincheng Academy.

290
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,920
from Lincheng Academy.

291
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
Bravo!

292
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Awesome!

293
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,120
Amazing.

294
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,680
Okay.

295
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,520
Awesome.

296
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,560
Awesome!

297
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,320
Amazing!

298
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,720
Ministers,

299
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
This is too fast.

300
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,440
Yes.

301
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,440
Congratulations.

302
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,120
The result is decided.

303
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Now I announce the winner

304
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,600
the winner is...

305
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,200
Wait.

306
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Okay.

307
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
Okay.

308
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,200
We found the key.

309
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,760
This...

310
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,040
This...

311
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Although you got the key,

312
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,240
Lee Yeongwon arrived before you.

313
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,160
Logically,

314
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,040
he should be the winner.

315
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,880
Yes!

316
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,840
Lord Chen.

317
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,440
We only said that

318
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,680
whoever finds the key will win.

319
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,240
We never said

320
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,600
Whoever comes first will win.

321
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,680
Yes.

322
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,640
If you make that judgment,

323
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,480
it will be unfair.

324
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,440
This...

325
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
What should we do?

326
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Who is she?

327
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,360
Who is she?

328
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,760
Run!

329
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Congratulations on obtaining the divine memorandum.

330
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,640
Master.

331
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
Master, my hand!

332
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,240
Help me!

333
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Your hand

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,840
was born for the Book of Heaven.

335
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,760
You're useless now.

336
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,240
Master.

337
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,120
Jun Xu.

338
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,920
I advise you

339
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,920
stay out of this.

340
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,840
I told you

341
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,960
I won't let you hurt them.

342
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
It's really you.

343
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
You controlled the gentleman's association.

344
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,120
In order to achieve your goal,

345
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,320
to achieve your goal.

346
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,680
You're despicable!

347
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,320
Despicable!

348
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,520
Shamo.

349
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,480
It's been 3,000 years.

350
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
If it weren't for you,

351
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,280
I wouldn't have had to

352
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,000
to be reborn

353
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,080
after thousands of years.

354
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
My Lord and I

355
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,400
have to go through these hardships.

356
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,040
Do you know

357
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,440
how much time I spent

358
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,280
It's time to end this today.

359
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,000
I won't let you

360
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
get the Book of Heaven easily.

361
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm sorry, Shamo.

362
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,800
Only by obtaining the divine memorandum

363
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,880
can I become the God of Gods.
