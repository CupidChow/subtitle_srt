1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,120
Thank you for lying to me.

2
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,600
Yuli.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,480
You don’t love Yuli at all.

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,120
You don’t love Yuli at all.

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
You used her and lied to her.

6
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Do you know

7
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,240
even if you get the Book of Heaven,

8
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
you also lost

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
who loves you the most.

10
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Is it worth it?

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
It's worth it.

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,480
It's okay.

13
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
As long as I can open the Book of Heaven,

14
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,079
I can summon her back.

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,079
Yuli is loyal to me.

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,480
She won't leave me.

17
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,960
Losing my love.

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
What a great loss of my love!

19
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,200
Today, I will let you

20
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,480
have a taste of this.

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Cheng Qi.

22
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,000
The dragon and phoenix wings

23
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
A perfect match.

24
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Shamo,

25
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,160
Promise me.

26
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,400
we will never be apart.

27
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,720
It's life and death.

28
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,600
The world doesn't appear out of thin air.

29
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,120
It comes from the creation of all beings.

30
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,320
The nightmare remains on its own desire

31
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,880
to control the Three Realms.

32
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,720
and eventually destroyed

33
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,640
greed and desire.

34
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Although the divine memorandum is with the nightmare,

35
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
and returned to chaos,

36
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,280
But he protected the Three Realms.

37
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,920
long-term balance.

38
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
The peace of the world.

39
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,440
How is it, doctor?

40
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,120
Judging from his pulse,

41
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,680
he must have been shocked

42
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
He was in a coma.

43
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,120
But it seems

44
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,240
he will wake up soon.

45
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,560
Thank you, doctor.

46
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Thank you.

47
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,840
You're awake.

48
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,520
Young Master

49
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Shrimp, where is this?

50
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,200
This...

51
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Cheng Mansion.

52
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,440
Your bedroom.

53
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Eldest Young Master, don't scare me.

54
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,840
Cheng Qi, are you okay?

55
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Are you alright?

56
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,360
Who are you?

57
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
This lady sent you home.

58
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,880
How do you know my name?

59
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,120
You don't know who I am.

60
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm Lin.

61
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm Lin. Have you forgotten?

62
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm Lin.

63
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,760
What about Shamo?

64
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,080
You remember who Shamo is, right?

65
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,680
Cheng Qi.

66
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,760
Don't scare me, Miss.

67
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,480
Please behave yourself.

68
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,160
Miss.

69
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
Come on.

70
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,720
Cheng Qi, come with me.

71
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
My young master

72
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,560
doesn't know you.

73
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,800
We also thank you

74
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,680
for saving our lives.

75
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,840
This

76
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
as a gift

77
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,040
for you.

78
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,240
Please accept it.

79
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,040
Shrimp.

80
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,280
You don't remember me either?

81
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,920
Miss.

82
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,640
I don't know

83
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,440
how you got my name.

84
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
But I really don't know you.

85
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,040
Cheng Qi, Shrimp.

86
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,360
What's wrong?

87
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,120
Miss.

88
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,840
As you can see,

89
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,640
our young master

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,680
needs to rest now.

91
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,240
Help yourself.

92
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,800
Cheng Qi.

93
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,280
I'm Lin.

94
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,920
Do you think

95
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm handsome,

96
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,400
I'm good at both literature and martial arts.

97
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,320
That's why you don't feel secure.

98
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
Thousands of lifetimes are like a dream

99
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,360
But I just want to find you

100
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,480
In the mortal world,

101
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Although we have met for so long,

102
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,600
but it's like the dawn of confusion

103
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
The sunset of the sky

104
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,600
will eventually

105
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,240
meet each other day and night.

106
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,880
We will never be apart again

107
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,200
Succulent meat.

108
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,120
I never thought

109
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
Cheng Qi would forget me.

110
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,240
Maybe

111
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
the person next to him

112
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
is not me.

113
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,560
Now that you're gone,

114
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,400
what's the point

115
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,760
in this world?

116
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Who said you are yourself?

117
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,480
You still have me.

118
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,160
Succulent, is that you?

119
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,800
You're alive.

120
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
Who said I'm dead?

121
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,440
Don't forget

122
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm a jade bowl demon.

123
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
With his little flame,

124
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
can burn me to death.

125
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Right now,

126
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,080
is just broken.

127
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,960
When I recover,

128
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,600
I can protect you again.

129
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,280
Lin,

130
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,040
don’t be discouraged.

131
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,400
Maybe Cheng Qi

132
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
just forgot about you.

133
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,800
In the future,

134
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
in the future.

135
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
You reunited after a thousand years.

136
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,080
How could he

137
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,960
forget you?

138
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Thank you, succulent meat.

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,240
Let's not talk about this now.

140
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,120
The most important thing now

141
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,640
is how I can recover.

142
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,400
Lin.

143
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
Help me find a way.

144
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes.

145
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay.

146
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
I've pasted the succulent meat for you.

147
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:02,960
Try it.

148
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
Okay, I'll try.

149
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,840
What should I do? I still can't.

150
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,560
Let me think.

151
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,640
Looks like you have to

152
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,560
another way.

153
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,920
I know.

154
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
Someone can help us.

155
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,680
Succulent meat.

156
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,400
I've recovered.

157
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm reborn.

158
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,520
Thank you, Master.

159
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,400
Thank you for letting me be reborn.

160
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Get up.

161
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Succulent meat.

162
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,000
Since you are not afraid of death,

163
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,960
you risked your life

164
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,360
and made a great contribution.

165
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,600
Now that I've become an immortal,

166
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,000
From now on,

167
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,840
I will follow Lin forever

168
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
and protect him.

169
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,800
Thank you, Master.

170
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,760
I didn't expect

171
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,880
I could live.

172
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,280
I want to eat roast duck.

173
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
I'll buy you anything you want.

174
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,000
Great.

175
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,480
Lin.

176
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,440
Do you want to see Jun Xu?

177
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,640
Jun Xu.

178
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,400
He's still alive.

179
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,280
Come with me.

180
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,920
Jun Xu's soul is still there.

181
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,920
I collected them

182
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
in the Soul Collecting Light.

183
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,160
I'm sorry, Jun Xu.

185
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,120
It's all my fault.

186
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,320
It's all my fault.

187
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,120
If it weren't for me,

188
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,320
you wouldn't have...

189
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,160
Jun Xu can feel it.

190
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,720
when we talk.

191
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
Jun Xu is doomed.

192
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,560
However,

193
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,320
don't feel too guilty.

194
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,560
Whether he can be reborn

195
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,600
depends on his fate.

196
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,040
Master, you mean

197
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,240
Jun Xu can still regain his true form.

198
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
But no one knows

199
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
We don't know.

200
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,720
Everything has its way.

201
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,480
It's all because of fate.

202
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,320
There is a reason, there is no result.

203
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,880
Only fate can't produce fruit.

204
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,440
Only when fate is compatible can there be fruit.

205
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,160
Just like you Dragon Phoenix Fairy.

206
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,280
The divine memorandum contacts you.

207
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,680
the fate of the younger generation.

208
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,800
Now that the Book of Heaven is scattered,

209
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,200
your fate will change.

210
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,080
The future

211
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,120
you can only rely on yourselves.
