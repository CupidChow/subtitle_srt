1
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,840
If Cheng Qi can

2
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,920
to awaken,

3
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,120
is also a good thing.

4
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,039
Big. Small. Small.

5
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
Young Master.

6
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,240
Why are you here?

7
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,840
I don't know.

8
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,680
Come on.

9
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,200
Come on.

10
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Come on, get up.

11
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,560
Here.

12
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,680
You know, thank you.

13
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,320
Who tied you up?

14
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
I don't know.

15
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,640
Get up.

16
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,200
Okay.

17
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,480
That's all for today.

18
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes, sir.

19
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,800
Are you leaving or not?

20
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,079
Come on.

21
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,800
Wait for me.

22
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Miao'er.

23
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,320
The kite festival is in a few days.

24
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,680
Tell me.

25
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
what wish should I make?

26
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,400
Okay.

27
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,040
Then make a wish.

28
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
and spend the night with your loved one.

29
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,720
okay?

30
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,160
Miao'er.

31
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:00,960
Jung-yeon.

32
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,960
Let me tell you.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,880
Are you talking about the kite festival?

34
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
I heard that

35
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,600
recently.

36
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Is he recovered?

37
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
But he looks

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,560
quite good.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
Why are you so flustered?

40
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
I just want to ask

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
when is the kite festival?

42
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,360
It'll be rain after Qingming.

43
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
The kite festival

44
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,520
is approaching.

45
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,120
Is it already past Qingming?

46
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
Why can't I remember anything?

47
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,440
Do you know when is the kite festival?

48
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
I heard that

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Lincheng Academy

50
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,040
held once a year.

51
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,840
every year.

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
All students can participate.

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,440
Let's see whose kite is the finest.

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,400
and fly the highest.

55
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,560
The winner

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
can represent the academy.

57
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,040
On the Dragon Boat Festival,

58
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
on the Dragon Boat Festival.

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
and make a wish.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
It's said that it works.

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't you know?

62
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Say something.

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll try him.

64
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,160
Hong Li.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,800
Succulent meat.

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
I just want to ask

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
when is the kite festival?

68
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
They didn't talk to me.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
It's weird.

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,200
Do you want to know?

71
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,840
Yes.

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,960
Let me tell you.

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,280
The kite festival

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,000
is

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,400
succulent.

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,080
Succulent meat.

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Stop right there!

78
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,320
Look at him.

79
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
he's fully recovered.

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,280
Yes.

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,159
Let's go.

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:38,960
Let's go.

83
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Lin.

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
I was bullied.

85
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,800
What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Who bullied you?

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
That dog demon...

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,640
Not only did it bully me,

89
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
and took my elbow away.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,480
Dog demon.

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,040
What happened?

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,040
I wanted to

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
for you.

94
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
For me?

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
I know you're in a bad mood

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,640
You're in a bad mood.

97
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,040
and always wanted to catch demons to cultivate elixirs for me.

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,480
I just want to

99
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,360
for you.

100
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,320
A lot of meat.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,320
You've grown up.

102
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,120
It's rare to have such filial piety.

103
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm so glad.

104
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay.

105
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Not only did you grab my elbow,

106
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,080
How dare you bully me?

107
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,720
You stay here.

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,760
You, come with me.

109
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,640
Me?

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,159
Yes, of course it's you.

111
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
If you don't come with me,

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,200
if you don't come with me?

113
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,159
If I don't,

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
how can I catch demons?

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,920
I can't.

116
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,880
Cut the crap.

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,440
Come with me.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,800
It's late.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,720
There's no one here.

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Where did the demon come from?

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,200
This...

122
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,160
This is the dog demon.

123
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,640
Yellow Dog.

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,200
You took my elbow.

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,640
Let's go.

126
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Nonsense.

127
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,159
This belongs to that jade bowl demon.

128
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,159
How can this dog talk?

129
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
It's a demon. I'm a demon.

130
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,760
Shut up.

131
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,280
The elbow you eat

132
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
is the jade bowl fairy.

133
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,280
It's for me.

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
Why did you take it?

135
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,280
to be filial to you?

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,280
No way.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
He was enjoying it.

138
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,200
Are you

139
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,560
by that jade bowl demon?

140
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,880
Besides,

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,920
he was the one

142
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,760
bragged to me.

143
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,120
I was just scaring him.

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
He dropped his elbow

145
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
and hit his head in a hurry.

146
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
It's all my fault.

147
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,320
Are you serious?

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,960
We are both demons.

149
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,440
I swear with my life that I won't lie.

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,720
How dare you!

151
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
Since it's a misunderstanding,

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,080
Dismiss.

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,760
But that jade bowl demon told me

154
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,560
you were a fierce dog.

155
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
No way.

156
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,640
I live alone in this alley.

157
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,320
I lived on leftovers.

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
I never hurt anyone.

159
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,280
Why did you slander me?

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
It's really succulent.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,039
It's just a lie.

162
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,480
Huang,

163
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Since you've become a demon,

164
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,880
why are you still living in your true form?

165
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Isn't it more convenient to live in human form?

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,800
If I live as a human,

167
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,840
how can I

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
return to my master?

169
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,280
Master.

170
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
Your master is still in the mortal world.

171
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,680
He's long gone.

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,960
But Master took me in.

173
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
He's a kind person.

174
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,520
He should be reincarnated.

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,480
But I don't know when we can meet again.

176
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,680
So I have to wait for him.

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,280
I misunderstood you about what happened today.

178
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,120
This is for you.

179
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,840
Take it with you from now on.

180
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
I can protect you when it's dangerous.

181
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,600
I wish you

182
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
reunite with your master soon.

183
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,800
Wait.

184
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
I think your cultivation

185
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
than me.

186
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,840
Can you help me

187
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,880
go to hell

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,080
and see

189
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
how my master is doing.

190
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Ask Yama

191
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
when he can be reincarnated.

192
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,320
I...

193
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
I...

194
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,760
I can't.

195
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,800
Please help it.

196
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
It's so pitiful.

197
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,280
Please help me.

198
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,840
Okay.

199
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,040
I'll help you.

200
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
But I can't guarantee

201
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,760
the time.

202
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
Sure. Thank you.

203
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,080
Why are you pulling me?

204
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,520
I won't talk to that dog.

205
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,400
Go!

206
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Hey, scholars.

207
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
are so timid?

208
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,640
Who said I'm timid?

209
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
Then open your eyes

210
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,560
and look down.

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Look down from here

212
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,480
The scenery is really nice.

213
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,000
I remember

214
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
I flew like this once.

215
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
But now that I think about it,

216
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
it might be just a dream.

217
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
It's just a dream.

218
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
Sometimes it's like real.

219
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
There are many things

220
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
that you can't imagine.

221
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,040
I used to understand

222
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,360
the beauty of this world every day.

223
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,360
I didn't expect

224
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
to live such a boring life

225
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,840
in your mansion?

226
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
Is life in the mansion

227
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800
really boring?

228
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,360
Boring.

229
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
Boring.

230
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,440
Think about it.

231
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,640
Every day,

232
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,080
eating and sleeping every day.

233
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,680
Aside from sleeping and studying.

234
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,960
What else can you do?

235
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Where are you

236
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,560
take me now?

237
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,760
Are you going to hell?

238
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,960
To help that dog demon

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
to find its owner.

240
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,160
No way.

241
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,680
That place in hell

242
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
is not something

243
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,720
can enter.

244
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
Then you're lying to it.

245
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
How could I lie to it?

246
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,320
We should get out of here first.

247
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,000
You fairies...

248
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
are really unreliable.

249
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
You lied to your own compatriots.

250
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,840
If you can't do it,

251
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,600
don't promise others.

252
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,040
Aren’t you the same?

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,080
Mr. Cheng.

254
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,840
A good demon is like a good person.

255
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,040
It's not that easy.

256
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
We can only do

257
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,240
we can do.

258
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Some things

259
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,000
we can't do or do.

260
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,080
This concerns me.

261
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,720
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

262
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
You won't understand anyway.

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
This is the secret of heaven.

264
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,320
Why did you let go?

265
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
You said you're not afraid.

266
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,640
Don't worry.

267
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,040
I won't leave you behind.

268
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,840
I told you not to let go.

269
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm all wet now.

270
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,720
You...

271
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,640
What are you looking at?

272
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,680
This...

273
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Where is this?

274
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,760
Why is it so dark?

275
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,800
He can't see.

276
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,760
Humans have poor eyesight.

277
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,760
The place we fell into the water

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
should be the falling Sakura Lake.

279
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,720
This is

280
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,800
by the fallen cherry Lake.

281
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,080
Are you afraid of the dark?

282
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,680
No.

283
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm just not used to it.

284
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm not used to it.

285
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
No wonder I scared you last time.

286
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
You're a man.

287
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,160
Just wait.

288
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,120
How is it? Is it brighter?

289
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,000
So beautiful.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
Yes.

291
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,680
These beautiful sceneries

292
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,600
can't see

293
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,720
in the City Mansion.

294
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I suddenly found that

295
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,320
there are good demons and bad demons.

296
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,120
Just like

297
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
we met today.

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,600
I didn't expect

299
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,920
there are demons

300
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
loyal and kind people.

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,240
Of course.

302
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,640
Actually, demons

303
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,680
are like you humans.

304
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,480
there are also good and evil.

305
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,720
I used to cultivate elixirs for succulent meat

306
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,720
and caught many evil demons.

307
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,000
But most demons

308
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,280
are actually kind people.

309
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,640
Especially those

310
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
who live in the mountain forest

311
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
in the mountain forest.

312
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,400
They are the creatures

313
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,680
natural creatures.

314
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,240
is harmless.

315
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,080
and fight with the world.

316
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
For example,

317
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,560
Me and succulent meat.

318
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,640
I didn't expect your life

319
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,800
is so colorful.

320
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,160
Compared to you,

321
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,840
than you.

322
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,640
Right

323
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
succulent meat is jade bowl fairy.

324
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Then what are you?

325
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,160
Well...

326
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,840
Actually, I've found

327
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
a powerful master.

328
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,000
Help me calculate.

329
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Strangely,

330
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
no one can tell what it is.

331
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,640
I've been like this

332
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,880
I've been like this.

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
So I think

334
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,400
maybe I am

335
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
the demon of air.

336
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,120
She doesn't know

337
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
where she came from.

338
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,920
There's a village ahead.

339
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,960
Let's go.

340
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,040
Why? Are you worried about me?

341
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm worried about myself.

342
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,800
Don't move.

343
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,120
Okay, let's go.

344
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,560
You said you weren't worried about me.

345
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,240
When you see the farm,

346
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Can you get changed?

347
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,480
Don't catch a cold.
