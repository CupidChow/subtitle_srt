1
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,640
I'm sorry, Shamo.

2
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,960
Only by obtaining the divine memorandum

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,040
can I become the God of Gods.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,840
Why?

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,320
Why?

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,000
In the last life,

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,480
you killed me.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,240
Lin.

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,760
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
How could I kill you?

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,720
Let go of me!

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,720
You killed me.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
You want to keep the Book of Heaven for yourself.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,800
Lin,

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,520
You misunderstood me.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,160
That's right.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,520
The person who loves you so much

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,440
killed his lover

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,760
for his own benefit.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,039
But he never thought

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,160
we found him.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,479
and made his original plan

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
his original plan.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,080
Yuli.

25
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,120
Stop talking nonsense.

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
What a joke.

27
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,080
You only care about

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,680
the one you love,

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,360
You betrayed your brother.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,479
Who are you to criticize me?

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,240
In my club,

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,200
you have to listen to me.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,360
Jun Xu.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
I advise you not to act rashly again.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,800
Lin.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,400
If you want to save her,

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
to show your loyalty,

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,079
maybe I can spare

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,120
her life.

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
If you're willing to listen to me,

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
and help me open the Book of Heaven,

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
Then I'll spare you.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,880
and return her Internal Dan.

44
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,800
I promise you.

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,640
Okay, I agree too.

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Lin, Cheng Qi.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,480
I remember

48
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
how to open the Book of Heaven.

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
The dragon and the phoenix appear in the mortal world.

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,680
A perfect match.

51
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
What's wrong with you two?

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,360
Yuli.

53
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,159
You didn’t expect that, did you?

54
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,880
Looks like

55
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,960
we did a good job.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
In the battle 3,000 years ago,

57
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
you rely on your strength.

58
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,159
They didn't win.

59
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,720
But this time,

60
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
I won’t let you

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
get what you want.

62
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
she will set you up.

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
What will she do?

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,200
She will make you turn against each other

65
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
and use one of you

66
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
or use us to turn against each other

67
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,640
to achieve their goal.

68
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,920
You miscalculated.

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,480
Master.

70
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
Is the Spirit Collecting Formation

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
really work?

72
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
It doesn't matter if it's useful or not.

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,520
but whether it can

74
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,560
to them.

75
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,880
Master.

76
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,960
How is Cheng Qi now?

77
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,360
He has strong energy.

78
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,880
His body has fully recovered.

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
But this Lin...

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,920
Lin.

81
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,840
What happened to Lin?

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,720
Her consciousness was cursed.

83
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,600
What?

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
It must be Yuli.

85
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,040
Master.

86
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,360
What should we do now?

87
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,040
Don’t worry.

88
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,000
Lin is a nine-tailed phoenix fairy.

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,200
Among all the Fengxian,

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,360
she is the strongest.

91
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
She won't be easily controlled by obsession.

92
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,640
Let her drink

93
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
the spring in the spring

94
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,680
will be fine.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Thank you, Master.

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,440
Nightmare.

97
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,480
I also want to thank you

98
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
for returning the Internal Dan to me.

99
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,680
But do you remember

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
what I just said?

101
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,240
The dragon and the phoenix appear in the mortal world.

102
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,680
They are a perfect match.

103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,680
Now the Internal Dan of Cheng Qi and I

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
have returned.

105
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,360
Nightmare.

106
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you want to die again?

107
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,240
Give me

108
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,760
to me.

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,800
Succulent meat.

110
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll say it again.

111
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,760
Give me back the Book of Heaven.

112
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,920
Lin,

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,840
Don't give it to him.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
Meng Liu, let him go.

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
Leave me alone.

116
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
Don't give them the Book of Heaven.

117
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,320
Lin,

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,120
Being able to meet you in this life

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,200
is the luckiest thing for me.

120
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,040
If it weren't for you,

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,360
I...

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,440
I might have died long ago.

123
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
Succulent meat.

124
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,840
Go get the Book of Heaven.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
Take this, Nightmare!

126
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,840
You guys?

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,800
Let's see how long you can hold on.

128
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,040
Give me back my divine memorandum!

129
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,280
Stop!

130
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,680
Cheng Qi.

131
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,800
Brother Xu.

132
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,520
I'm the only one who can break your seal.

133
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Even deities can't do anything.

134
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,560
Hand over the divine memorandum.

135
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Brother Xu.

136
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,640
Brother Xu.

137
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,880
My Lord.

138
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,560
He will definitely give you the divine memorandum.

139
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,440
Please spare his life.

140
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Are you pleading for him?

141
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,520
Childish.

142
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
To be honest,

143
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
In less than an hour,

144
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
Jun Xu will die.

145
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Yuli.

146
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,000
Wake up.

147
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,240
If he opens the Book of Heaven,

148
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,600
the whole Three Realms

149
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,880
will be in misery.

150
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
It'll be too late then.

151
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,040
A nightmare?

152
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,160
Even if I die,

153
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,360
even if I die.

154
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,600
Fine.

155
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
Since you want to die,

156
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,080
I'll send you off now.

157
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,120
Yuli.

158
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,440
Yuli.

159
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
Why are you doing this?

160
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,720
Brother.

161
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,000
Yuli

162
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,600
made many mistakes.

163
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,920
Please forgive me.

164
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,760
Yuli.

165
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,440
I’ll be your sister next time.

166
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,000
My Lord.

167
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,240
Do you love me?

168
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,360
I want the truth.

169
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,440
You know

170
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,079
there is another way to open the Book of Heaven.

171
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,520
is to lose my love.

172
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,319
If I die,

173
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,920
you can fulfill your wish.

174
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,080
I have no regrets.

175
