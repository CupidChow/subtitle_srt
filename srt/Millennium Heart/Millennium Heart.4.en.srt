1
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,840
I'd rather die than read.

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,800
Why don't you

3
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,160
I take the Internal Dan by force?

4
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,160
Miss Fairy.

5
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
Miss Fairy.

6
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,240
Why is his hand so cold?

7
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,360
Forget it.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,759
Just use it.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,280
Just think of it as what I owe you in my previous life.

10
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,079
Brother Chang,

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
Let's play a game later.

12
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,800
Sure.

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,320
Hurry up.

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
I miss you so much during the spring break.

15
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,120
Li,

16
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:41,960
Did you gain weight

17
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Did you gain weight?

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,000
Jung-yeon

19
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,640
Jung-yeon.

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,720
Miao'er. Wanwan.

21
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,079
We haven't seen each other during the holiday.

22
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,480
I missed you so much.

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
I miss you too.

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,400
Me too.

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,079
Let's go.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,440
Let's go.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,840
Why didn't you

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
come to me during the holiday?

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,560
What a beautiful academy.

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,880
This door is so big.

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,160
So magnificent.

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,040
Do you usually

33
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
study here?

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,280
It's so exciting.

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:16,880
Right?

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,200
Watch your language.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
One more time.

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,840
Here,

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,600
You are my cousin Cheng Lin.

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,200
Your name is Cheng Lin.

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,640
Your name is Cheng Ming.

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,280
Remember.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,160
Besides,

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,840
you can't use magic here.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
The academy is full of bad students.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
Don't make trouble with me.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,640
Look. Let's go.

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,880
Good.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,960
Well done!

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,600
Look at this move.

51
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,240
Amazing!

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,200
Yeah.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Yes.

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,000
Hurry up.

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Coming

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,520
What is this place?

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
This is the place

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,120
in our school.

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,160
It’s so lively there.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,800
Let's take a look.

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,440
Let's go.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,519
Awesome.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,440
He's amazing.

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
That was an amazing move.

65
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,640
Great!

66
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,080
Awesome.

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,200
Awesome.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,240
Great.

69
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,680
Okay.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Bravo!

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,880
Well done!

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,760
Good.

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,840
Well done!

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,720
Look at him

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,840
overbearing.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,680
I don't know even if I win.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,560
Give your opponent a hand.

78
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
He must be an immoral person.

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,160
I didn't expect

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,880
you can tell right from wrong.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,680
Brother Cheng.

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Long time no see.

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,320
Li, long time no see.

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,720
Go and have a look.

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
Cheng Qi is competing with Li Ning Yuan.

86
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,680
Hurry up.

87
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's go. Coming.

88
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,159
Goodbye, sir.

89
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
Master Xu.

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,440
Miss Lin.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
Just call me Jun Xu.

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,760
Jun Xu.

93
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,560
That's a nice name.

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
So you study here too.

95
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,320
Sort of.

96
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,560
Not bad.

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,920
You're not old. You're quite skilled.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
We should be classmates.

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,440
Isn't it fate?

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,440
In the future,

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
if anyone dares to bully you in this academy,

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,840
just call me

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,720
my name.

104
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,840
Okay.

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,240
The shooting competition begins now.

106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
The first round, single target shooting.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
It's just a competition.

108
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,360
It's so complicated.

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
What single target shooting?

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,680
Look.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
Both of you shoot the same arrow.

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,040
Whoever gets closer to the bullseye

113
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,000
will win.

114
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Mr. Cheng is not good at martial arts.

115
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,960
I’m afraid he’ll lose this time.

116
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,080
In terms of knowledge,

117
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,320
in learning.

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,360
In martial arts,

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,280
in martial arts.

120
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,400
That's right.

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Not necessarily.

122
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,800
Maybe Mr. Cheng

123
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,920
has changed.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,400
right?

125
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,280
Yes.

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,760
Get ready.

127
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,000
Here we go.

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,640
Got it.

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Hit the bullseye!

130
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,320
Hit the bullseye!

131
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
He's amazing.

132
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,720
Awesome.

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,800
Lee Yeongwon won the first round.

134
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
Li Ning Yuan is amazing.

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,800
OK.

136
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,320
Li Ning Yuan

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,000
will definitely win.

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah.

139
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,040
That's right.

140
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,200
I didn't

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,480
for Cheng Qi.

142
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,040
Yes.

143
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,800
Wonderful.

144
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
Cheng Qi, don't give up.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay.

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,080
Yes, come on.

147
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,720
It's good enough

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,520
That's good enough.

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,040
Yeah.

150
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,320
Round two.

151
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,280
Move target shooting.

152
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,320
Move target.

153
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,720
Move. This is harder.

154
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Move.

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,000
I know this.

156
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,760
This is to move the target

157
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,440
move the target.

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,800
It increases the difficulty of shooting.

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Right?

160
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,080
This is a test

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,080
the ability

162
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,040
and stability.

163
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,080
If you feel uncomfortable,

164
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,480
it's not too late to give up now.

165
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
Get ready.

166
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,000
This...

167
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,640
Really?

168
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,640
Did I see it wrong?

169
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,960
I got it.

170
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,760
Did I see it right?

171
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,600
Round two.

172
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
Cheng Qi wins.

173
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
He must be confused.

174
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,200
My goodness.

175
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,320
I didn't expect Cheng Qi

176
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,200
after the Spring vacation,

177
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,039
I can't believe

178
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
has improved so much.

179
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,480
I don't think so.

180
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,480
Just a guess.

181
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,520
Wang Lu is right.

182
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,480
I told you.

183
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,480
Mr. Cheng is different now.

184
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,160
It depends on

185
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,080
if Mr. Cheng

186
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
in the next round?

187
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,720
That's right.

188
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
I didn't know

189
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,240
he's capable.

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,520
Round three.

191
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,840
Aim target shooting.

192
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,480
Awesome.

193
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,760
Come on.

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
Hold your breath and focus.

195
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,480
Pull all your energy into your energy.

196
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Cheng Qi won the third round.

197
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,520
Amazing.

198
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,000
How did you do it?

199
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,680
See?

200
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,680
Cheng Qi is not lucky.

201
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,160
but strength.

202
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,520
Jung-yeon

203
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:20,920
It's...

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Who is that woman?

205
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,120
Let’s go.

206
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,680
Why is she

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,640
to Mr. Cheng?

208
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
I think this girl

209
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,480
looks pretty.

210
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,440
Wait for me.

211
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
Don't talk nonsense.

212
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,040
Cheng Qi.

213
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,800
How did you become

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,440
so powerful?

215
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,000
Hurry up.

216
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Can you teach us?

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,480
Yes

218
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,320
Teach us

219
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,160
Teach us

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,160
Aren't you going to congratulate them

221
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,760
No.

222
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,200
I don't like to join in the fun.

223
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,640
Let's go.

224
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,280
I was just lucky today.

225
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,360
But if you sincerely

226
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
learn archery from me,

227
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,080
we'll talk about it next time.

228
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's call it a day.

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay.

230
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,160
That's all.

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,840
Let's go.

232
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,320
Let's go.

233
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,520
He's really amazing today.

234
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Yes, he's amazing.

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,360
I wish I could be like him.

236
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,880
It's like God's help.

237
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Yes.

238
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,480
Mr. Cheng, congratulations.

239
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,600
I don’t know

240
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,440
still count?

241
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
If you're free,

242
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,440
I want to learn from you.

243
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,000
Of course.

244
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,440
Miss Lin,

245
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
what is the academy

246
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,000
is like?

247
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,280
The academy I imagined.

248
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,320
And sir.

249
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,520
endless teachings.

250
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,400
What about me

251
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,360
What about me?

252
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Mr. Xu, I don't know yet.

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,920
But I always feel

254
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,040
you are different from other students.

255
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,000
You look more mature.

256
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,520
By the way, Mr. Xu,

257
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,720
do you know how to play the piano?

258
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,400
A little.

259
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

260
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,040
I’m just lucky.

261
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
Just tell me, Miss Zhou.

262
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,560
With all due respect,

263
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,880
I always see a man and a woman

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
with Mr. Cheng today.

265
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
Who are you?

266
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,920
They...

267
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
One is my cousin Cheng Ming,

268
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,360
and my cousin Cheng Lin.

269
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
I see.

270
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,960
Miss Lin.

271
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Are you sick?

272
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,160
Just ignore them.

273
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
They are naughty.

274
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,560
Thank you.

275
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,440
Thank you.

276
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,360
Huang.

277
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,080
Master.

278
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,520
Sorry for not welcoming you.

279
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,640
Welcome.

280
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,880
Mr. Cheng, long time no see.

281
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
Long time no see.

282
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,520
Hong Li.

283
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,200
Hurry up.

284
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,080
Your benefactor, Mr. Cheng.

285
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,680
Greetings, Mr. Cheng.

286
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
This kid is really honest.

287
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Get up.

288
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,360
Please sit down.

289
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,800
Thanks to you.

290
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,280
Otherwise, my nephew

291
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,480
wouldn't have the chance

292
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,040
to study at the No.1 Academy in Lincheng.

293
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,680
We are friends of life and death.

294
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,760
It's nothing.

295
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't mention it.

296
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,040
Besides,

297
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
you're his uncle.

298
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,640
I'll be his uncle.

299
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,560
Of course.

300
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,280
Call me uncle.

301
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Mr. Cheng.

302
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Just call me uncle.

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,360
Mr. Cheng.

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,760
Okay.

305
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,600
Get up.

306
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,480
This kid is very ignorant.

307
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,600
From now on, you must be with Cheng Qi.

308
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,240
Cheng Di.

309
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,600
Learn more.

310
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,280
Don't be silly all day.

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Don't worry, Uncle.

312
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,720
I'll study hard.

313
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,720
Greetings, Master.

314
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,600
Greetings, Father.

315
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,160
Okay.

316
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,120
Perfect timing.

317
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,640
Come.

318
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,000
Let me introduce.

319
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Di.

320
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,160
This is your Uncle Huang.

321
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
and my best friend.

322
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Hello, Uncle Huang.

323
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,040
This is Uncle Huang's nephew.

324
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,560
His name is...

325
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,240
Hong Li.

326
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,280
Hongli.

327
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,600
Hello, Madam.

328
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,760
Hello, Brother Cheng.

329
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,640
Hello, Hongli.

330
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,080
Huang.

331
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,760
I'm free today.

332
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
Let's stay for lunch.

333
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
so that the kids

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
get to know each other.

335
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,840
If you say so,

336
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,880
I’ll do as you say.

337
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,680
OK. Have some tea.

338
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,640
Thank you.

339
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Take care

340
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,480
Please sit down.

341
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,840
What would you like to eat?

342
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,880
Five black bean noodles.

343
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,800
Three more bowls

344
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:58,880
Okay.

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,720
Eight black bean noodles.

346
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Hold on.

347
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,640
Wait.

348
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,840
You haven't ordered yet.

349
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,640
What do you want to eat?

350
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
You two can eat eight bowls of jjajangmyeon.

351
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,800
Of course.

352
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,400
We've been here for a thousand years.

353
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,920
Eight bowls are fine.

354
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,560
One more bowl.

355
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,560
Okay, nine bowls.

356
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,200
Wait a moment.

357
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,600
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

358
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,760
What would you like to eat?

359
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Just black bean noodles

360
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,200
Okay three bowls of black bean noodles

361
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,320
Hold on.

362
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Who is that woman?

363
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,560
Why is she following you?

364
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,400
The daughter of Zhou Mang, Minister of Personnel.

365
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,920
Zhou Jingyun.

366
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
Three bowls, please.

367
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,000
Take care, sir.

368
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,560
Your noodles.

369
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,400
You've been following me too.

370
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,440
You're following me now, okay?

371
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Just kidding.

372
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,320
Mind your own business.

373
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,720
Look at Cheng Lin.

374
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,720
is so close to Mr. Cheng.

375
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It’s strange.

376
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,440
Normal siblings

377
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,760
look similar.

378
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,320
But look at them.

379
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,720
They don't look alike at all.

380
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,000
Right.

381
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,040
I heard that

382
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
many new students will come this year.

383
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,880
It seems that

384
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,880
The academy is very lively this year.

385
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:00,960
Right, Jing Yan?

386
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,319
Hello, I'm Hongli.

387
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,800
Nice to meet you.

388
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,720
Nice to meet you.

389
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
He's so funny.

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
All right. Quiet.

391
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
Take a seat

392
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,520
empty seat over there.

393
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,560
Thank you

394
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,440
Hello

395
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,560
Hello

396
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,880
Okay. Silence.

397
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
Let's review

398
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,080
the song of last class.

399
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
Who taught you this?

400
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,880
Playing randomly.

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
Did I teach you that?

402
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,240
Everyone, stop!

403
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,000
Joo Jeong-yeon.

404
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,080
Play a song for us.

405
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,880
She plays well.

406
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,240
Yeah.

407
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,520
See?

408
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,120
This is called playing the piano.

409
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,120
Let's continue.
