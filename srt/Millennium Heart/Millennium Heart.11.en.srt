1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,160
Look. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here.

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,600
The lid of these cosmetics

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,680
have been opened.

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,080
The smoke

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,280
are gathering towards that place.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,720
This is a formation.

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,120
But it's strange.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,040
I've never seen it before.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,800
Wait.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
There must be something wrong with this formation.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,360
I know.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,400
This formation

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,720
is used by women's desire for beauty.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,320
That's why she's collecting some power.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,600
Power?

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,800
Who made this?

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,000
You can guess so much.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,680
It's her.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,200
She...

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,360
Who? You know each other?

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,760
You have a good memory.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,280
Yes.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,720
We met at the gambling house.

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,920
I'll come and see you again today.

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,080
It's really you.

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
You escaped last time.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,080
How dare you come out and hurt people?

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm everywhere with desires.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
As strong as human desires,

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,720
my power is.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,200
A little demon and a human

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,800
What can they do to me?

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,480
What is this?

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,200
I don't know.

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,440
I've never seen it either.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
Let’s go first.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,079
Lin.

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,320
Are you okay?

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Looks like

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,680
we can't escape this time.

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Let's fight!

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,000
Focus.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,040
You cooperate with me.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,360
I'll cooperate with you.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,079
Yes, you cooperate with me.

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
Stop hiding and come out.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,120
Be good.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,080
I'll make you

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
walk freely.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,079
Lin, are you okay?

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,720
Lin.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Lin.

53
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Didn't you say you would help me?

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
Come on!

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,760
Could it be...

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,320
only one of us

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,280
can use Internal Dan.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
What are you waiting for?

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,320
Hurry up.

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,800
Close your eyes.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,800
What did you sprinkle just now?

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,520
Chili.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,480
Look.

64
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,760
Demons don't like chilies.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,080
Demons don't like chilies.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
I asked you to cooperate with me.

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
Why didn't I?

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
If it weren't for the chili noodles,

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
you would have been in her mouth.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,080
Tell me, what should we do now?

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,600
I'll cooperate with you.

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,200
Go ahead.

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,600
Let me tell you.

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,880
this demon

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,519
is much stronger than before.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,800
What should we do now?

78
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
How do I know what to do

79
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,800
Sprinkle chili

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,640
Sprinkle chili

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,640
Come on.

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,080
Chili.

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
Thank you for your help.

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,800
You're welcome.

85
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
It's nothing.

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,440
Thank you for saving me.

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,200
Sir,

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
for the one you love,

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,080
for the one you love?

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
The Immortal Powder

91
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,720
can help you return to the yang to save the rebel.

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,200
I can give it to you.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,240
Of course.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,840
If you don't believe me, forget it.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
I just saw

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
this young master is born with a heart disease.

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,760
and weak.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,640
Today, I lost all my yang energy.

99
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
I'm just worried about your life.

100
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,120
Thank you, Master.

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,520
Thank you, master.

102
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,560
You're welcome.

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,760
Lin.

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,360
What happened?

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
I couldn't open the door.

106
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,200
Are you okay?

107
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,120
Okay.

108
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
The cabbage will be cold when you come.

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,160
Let's go.

110
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,240
Why am I here?

111
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,880
Xin'er.

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,640
Xin'er.

113
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,000
What's wrong?

114
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,160
Here.

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,560
Here.

116
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,440
Get some rest.

117
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,120
What's wrong?

118
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
The chili noodles you just threw

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,880
is still in my throat.

120
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,320
Really?

121
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,240
Yes.

122
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,320
What should we do?

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,640
I don't know.

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay, go to sleep.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,560
Idiot.

126
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
You're not in good health,

127
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,120
and you're here to protect me.

128
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,640
Actually,

129
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,720
has a bad temper and a bad face,

130
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
he's quite nice.

131
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,120
Cheng Qi can use his power.

132
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,160
Does that mean

133
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,000
is getting better?

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
Maybe my Internal Dan

135
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
will be back soon.

136
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,440
Shamo.

137
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,640
You go first.

138
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,640
No.

139
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,440
Let's go.

140
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,880
Ao Qi.

141
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,520
No.

142
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,400
Ao Qi.

143
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
I look at you every day.

144
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,360
I can't believe you're in my dream.

145
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
I wish I could get the Internal Dan back

146
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
and get rid of you.

147
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
so that I won't be troubled all day.

148
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,360
What are you doing?

149
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,120
I... I think you're crying.

150
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,120
Let me wipe it for you.

151
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,920
I'm crying.

152
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
Where is my hand dirty?

153
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,880
Look, my place is clean.

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,240
okay?

155
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,760
Young Master.

156
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,040
What's wrong?

157
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,640
Madam is here.

158
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,760
Ask Miss Lin

159
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,640
hide first.

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Otherwise, it'll be harder to explain.

161
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,360
Where should I hide?

162
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,120
Go and stop Madam.

163
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:49,960
Go!

164
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
Under the bed Under the bed

165
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,880
I can't get in.

166
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,000
This way.

167
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,240
Hurry up. You can hide here.

168
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,320
How?

169
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,280
What if we get caught?

170
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,240
Just don't make a sound. Hurry up.

171
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,920
Hurry up.

172
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,760
My skirt.

173
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,680
Have you eaten?

174
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,520
Where is Qi?

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,160
Young Master is sleeping.

176
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,280
I'll go check on him.

177
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,520
Madam.

178
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,680
Qi.

179
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,120
Mother.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Come here.

181
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:19,880
Mother.

182
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,400
What brings you here?

183
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,880
Can't I come if I'm free?

184
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,400
Qi.

185
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,760
How are you lately?

186
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,880
Why do you look so haggard?

187
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm fine.

188
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Look.

189
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,680
I went to greet your father this morning.

190
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,360
He said he hasn't seen you

191
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,200
for days.

192
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,280
I came to see you a few nights ago,

193
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,000
but you weren't there.

194
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
Did you go out?

195
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,480
Mother, don't worry.

196
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm free.

197
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,040
I just went out for a walk.

198
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,000
Mother, have a seat.

199
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,160
Shrimp.

200
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,400
What are you waiting for?

201
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,920
Go make tea for Madam.

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm fine. I just caught a cold.

203
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,800
Nanny Gao.

204
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,320
Go to Heaven Youxiang.

205
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,640
take back the clothes

206
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,360
for Qi.

207
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
Madam.

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Your servant.

209
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Now only Xie and Shrimp are left.

210
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,000
Did I not

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
well?

212
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,520
How about I transfer Huan and Xin

213
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
to take care of you?

214
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,000
No, Mother.

215
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,600
Mother, it's okay.

216
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,120
Rat.

217
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,360
It's just a mouse.

218
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,400
Is this the mouse you mentioned?

219
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,240
A big mouse?

220
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,880
This time,

221
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,600
I understand now.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
This is a good thing

223
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,400
It's a good thing.

224
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,000
Qi.

225
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

226
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm not

227
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
a cold-hearted person.

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,160
You're alone now.

229
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,240
and you're not in good health.

230
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,760
Just stay here and rest.

231
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,560
As for other things,

232
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,000
Qi and I will help you.

233
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,120
Poor child.

234
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,640
If you need anything,

235
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,720
just tell me.

236
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,040
you lost your parents when you were young.

237
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,120
Just treat Cheng Mansion as your home.

238
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,760
Nanny Gao.

239
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,600
Go to my room

240
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,520
and bring some fine jade and jade

241
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,360
to Lin'er's room.

242
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Yes, Madam.

243
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,120
No, ma'am.

244
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm already satisfied

245
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm already very satisfied.

246
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,760
Really?

247
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Madam said it's for you.

248
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,440
Just take it.

249
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,320
Thank you, Mother.

250
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Thank you, Madam.

251
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,000
By the way, Qi,

252
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,400
a friend of your father

253
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,000
Mr. Huang

254
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,760
mentioned to you before.

255
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,360
I hired a miracle doctor for you.

256
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
to cure your heart disease.

257
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,760
Mother.

258
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,240
Didn't I tell you before?

259
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,680
my heart disease has long recovered.

260
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,240
Much better.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,120
Your heart disease has been incurable for a long time.

262
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
You didn't take any elixir.

263
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,360
How is it fine?

264
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,240
I can't say that

265
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
the elixir.

266
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,440
Is Lin'er in a good mood

267
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,760
You're in a good mood.

268
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,160
so you feel better.

269
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,880
Being with a fairy every day

270
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,800
when I'm with a female demon every day.

271
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,960
Greetings, God.

272
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Have you found

273
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,320
I'm looking for?

274
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,120
My Lord,

275
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,920
the sisters have noticed

276
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,440
but no trace has been found.

277
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,160
Okay.

278
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,520
Thank you, fairy.

279
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,520
Yes.

280
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,400
Shamo.

281
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,400
