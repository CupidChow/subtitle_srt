1
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,800
Xie.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,040
You're just in time.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,720
Send this to Eldest Young Master.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,240
Young Master is having a banquet today.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,960
Don't delay it.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,120
Yes.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,160
I feel dizzy.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,880
Brother

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,960
Why are you still here?

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
I saw sister-in-law waiting for you

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,040
waiting for you.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Go now.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Sister-in-law is waiting for you.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,840
Father is waiting for you too.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,560
Okay, Cheng Di.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,200
Take care of them for me.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
I'll be back soon.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:08,920
Okay.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,400
Great.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Nice dance.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,320
Meihwan.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,080
Master.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,360
They danced so well.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,160
Okay.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,320
Okay.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's eat first.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,640
The good luck

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,720
should be touched.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,280
Yes.

31
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,320
It's all set.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,680
Don't worry, Mother.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,000
Cheng Qi has gone.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,039
Everyone.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,560
Today,

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
is my son.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,840
The wedding day.

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,000
I've decided.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,919
On the day of the gentleman meeting,

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,280
I will present

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,880
the heirloom of our family

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
Let the people in Lincheng

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,560
to see the real face of the book.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,760
Great!

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Great!

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Let's have another drink.

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
OK. Come on.

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
That’s the heirloom

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
of the Cheng family.

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
Of course.

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
This is Mr. Cheng’s.

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,240
of Mr. Cheng.

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,520
Why isn't anyone here yet?

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,320
Wait a little longer.

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm going to fall asleep.

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,280
It's almost

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
it's almost time.

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,079
Just wait.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,440
Have an apple.

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,079
Forget it.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
You'll lose your lipstick after eating it.

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,520
I have to replenish it.

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,960
This is the engagement banquet.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,560
You haven't eaten anything all day.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,920
Are you really getting married?

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,920
It'll take a month.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,760
for a month.

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Greetings, Miss Lin.

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,680
Mr. Meat.

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Eldest Young Master, Master Cheng, Madam.

71
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,120
Please go to the wedding hall.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,160
Tell Cheng Qi I'm coming.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Help me up.

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:17,920
Go.

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,600
Lin.

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,200
Lin.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
Mr. Cheng.

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,240
What did you call me?

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
I want to call you Mr. Cheng today.

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,000
Can't I?

81
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,880
It's not impossible.

82
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,120
Can I look like this now?

83
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,920
Pretty good.

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,960
Even if this love only lasts for a moment,

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,440
Even if you

86
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,000
as someone else, so what?

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,520
Lin,

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm willing to hold your hand

89
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,000
I paint your eyebrows every morning

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,920
and comb your hair every night.

91
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,920
We meet every day

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,440
I miss you every day.

93
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,640
and grow old together.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,440
and never be apart.

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,200
Cheng Qi.

96
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,200
Lin.

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,640
Zhou Jing Yan.

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,080
Why are you here?

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,520
Mr. Cheng.

100
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
You bastard!

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
How could you say that to Mr. Cheng?

102
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,520
Lin.

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,640
You ungrateful

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
and heartless.

105
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,360
Lin.

106
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,360
Mr. Cheng.

107
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,760
Not here yet?

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
Why isn't he here yet?

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
Master, I couldn't find him.

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,560
What?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
Why can't I find it?

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
Keep looking.

113
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,760
Hurry up.

114
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,880
Yes.

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,000
Gosh.

116
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,760
So rude.

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Sorry, Mr. Cheng.

118
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
I have something to do at home.

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,240
I have to go.

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
Mr. Lin.

121
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,880
Here.

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
Sorry.

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,240
Mr. Cheng.

125
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
See you, Mr. Cheng.

126
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,200
Sorry. Sorry.

127
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,840
Goodbye.

128
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
Take care.

129
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
I'll get going then.

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,159
Where's Jung-yeon?

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,159
Why isn't she back yet?

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,840
Look at you.

133
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
You've grown up.

134
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,159
Why do you still care?

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,360
Back then,

136
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,400
we were too strict

137
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
Jung Yeon is introverted

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,680
She doesn't talk much

139
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
Now, look.

140
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,080
She doesn't know

141
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
She doesn't even know her.

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,680
Do you still want

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,640
ask our daughter to get married?

144
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
Of course.

145
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,880
Our daughter is not young anymore.

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
See you, Mr. Cheng.

147
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,440
Take care.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:13,920
Goodbye.

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,920
We'll leave as well.

150
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,600
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

151
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,920
Take care.

153
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't worry.

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,280
I think

155
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,120
we should go back first.

156
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,840
Okay, let's go.

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Brother Zhou.

158
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,600
Mr. Cheng.

159
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
It’s late, Mr. Cheng.

160
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,159
We’re leaving.

161
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm really sorry.

162
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,040
Don't.

163
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,880
Take care.

164
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,960
Okay, sorry.

165
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,720
Let's go.

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,920
By the way, Master,

167
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,560
I haven’t given Lin the betrothal gift.

168
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,400
We can't find him.

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Why do you need a betrothal gift?

170
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:02,920
You two.

171
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
Why are you still sitting here?

172
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,960
Go back to your room.

173
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,360
Lin.

174
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Sorry.

175
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,360
What's going on?

177
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,200
Something bad happened.

178
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
Cheng Qi and Zhou Jing Yan

179
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,680
met in the garden.

180
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,480
What?

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Lin! Lin!

182
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Lin! Lin!

183
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,200
Lin.

184
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:27,920
If you need anything,

185
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
we can talk outside.

186
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,440
Don't do anything stupid.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Lin.

188
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,760
Lin.

189
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Lin.

190
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,600
Say it.

191
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
What did you do to her?

192
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,480
Lin.

193
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Let me explain, Lin.

194
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,920
What's there to explain?

195
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,360
Lin.

196
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,120
Don’t stop me.

197
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,360
Lin,

198
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
I entrust her to you.

199
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
How could you bully her?

200
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,640
Lin.

201
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,280
Lin.

202
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,920
Stop fighting!

203
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,680
Lin.

204
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
From now on,

205
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,680
we will go our separate ways

206
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,680
and never meet again.

207
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,800
This place is so familiar.

208
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,800
Why do I feel

209
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
I've been here before?

210
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,560
Maybe in some time and space.

211
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,360
you really came here.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,560
Jun Xu.

213
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Do you have any wine?

214
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,360
Wine? You want to drink?

215
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,360
If you want to drink, I'm fine.

216
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,200
I'll show my true form.

217
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,760
You guys drink.

218
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,800
I'll go there.

219
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
This is a century-old peach blossom wine.

220
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,360
You'll get drunk easily.

221
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
You can't drink much. Don't drink too much.

222
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,720
Jun Xu.

223
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,680
Have you ever liked someone?

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,680
So you liked someone else too.

225
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,440
Shamo.

226
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,360
Guess what I brought you.

227
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,680
What?

228
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
So cute.

229
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,560
Good boy.

230
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,480
Thank you.

231
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,720
Where did you find it?

232
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,720
Do you like it?

233
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,320
Yes.

234
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm glad you like it.

235
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

236
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,960
Okay.

237
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,920
She left you too, right?

238
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,200
Why?

239
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,280
Why?

240
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,280
Why can't we be together

241
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,720
when you like someone?

242
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,480
Why?

243
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
Why did Cheng Qi

244
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Why did he choose this day

245
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,400
to let me know

246
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
he likes Zhou Jingyun.

247
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,320
What you see may not be true.

248
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,280
The truth

249
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,480
Maybe not.

250
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Liar.

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
Liar!

252
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,680
Liar!

253
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,080
Liar!

254
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,720
Lin.

255
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,680
Lin.

256
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,600
You were immortals.

257
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,760
But you have to

258
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
The love tribulation in this world
