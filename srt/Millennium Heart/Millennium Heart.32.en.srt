1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,000
Why are you here?

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,880
I was just passing by.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,360
and found the scenery here great.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,200
So I came down to have a look.

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,320
What about you?

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,760
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,920
I was just passing by

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,320
The view here is so nice.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,880
It's just like what I saw in my dream.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,840
Thank you

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,920
for what happened before.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,960
Then the servants told me

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,720
you found me unconscious.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,520
Nothing.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,640
Do you really

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,720
remember this place?

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,600
Remember what?

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,800
Follow me.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,920
At that time,

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000
we came here

21
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,039
we came here.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,120
You sit here.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,960
I'll sit here.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,360
We chatted together.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,160
Do you remember

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,880
You said you were afraid of the dark,

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,640
I was still like this.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,199
Do you remember?

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
But I'm never afraid of the dark.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,280
No way.

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,040
No way.

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,280
You're afraid of the dark.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,040
Miss,

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
Did you mistake me for someone else?

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Later...

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
We went to

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
to the village ahead.

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,480
We went to the farm to eat roasted sweet potatoes.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
You said you never had it.

40
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,280
and asked me if it was soil.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Then I forced you to take a bite.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,440
You told me

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,720
that you've never

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
such delicious food.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,720
Alright, girl.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,440
I understand what you mean.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,040
Maybe

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,600
had a deep relationship

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
but died without any disease.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,880
But you can never

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,920
get out of that relationship.

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,560
What you want

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
is just that relationship.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,640
and that person.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,720
Maybe

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
I really look like

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
the person you mentioned.

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
But I'm not him.

59
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,640
It's late.

60
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,520
Where do you live?

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,280
Let me send you home.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,720
No.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
I can go back by myself.

64
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,400
Don't move.

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,720
It's getting late.

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
It's not safe for a girl

67
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
It's not safe to walk alone.

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,680
Consider it my thank you

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
for saving me last time.

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,120
It's okay.

72
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,760
Miss.

73
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,360
I really don't remember

74
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,160
what happened that day.

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Can you tell me

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
from the beginning?

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
You don't even remember me now.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,720
Moreover,

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,760
I’m afraid

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,080
I’m afraid you’ll think

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm sick.

82
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
When you went to the theater that day,

83
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,200
I suddenly asked you to perform on stage.

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,920
But then,

85
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
a group of robbers

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,960
in the theater.

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
They are all tall

88
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
and strong.

89
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,360
These strong men

90
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,440
are doing whatever they want in the restaurant.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,880
and rob people.

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
We couldn't stand it anymore.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
so we beat them together.

94
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,720
So,

95
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
one of them

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,560
by one of them.

97
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,520
I fought with someone.

98
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I was knocked out by someone else.

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,640
But I

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,520
know martial arts at all.

101
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

102
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,400
Mr. Cheng, you’re so skilled.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,360
Miss.

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,480
Are you lying?

105
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Is that true?

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,600
Young Master.

107
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,880
Mr. Cheng.

108
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Thank you for sending me back today.

109
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,320
Young Master.

110
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,880
It's raining.

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,080
Let's go back.

112
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,200
Ruyi Temple?

113
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,720
Shrimp.

114
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,680
Have we been here before?

115
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,560
Ruyi Temple?

116
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Xiao Xie.

117
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,640
I'm asking you.

118
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,680
Have we been here before?

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
Ru... Ruyi Temple?

120
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,680
Have you been here before?

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
No

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,760
No.

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Are you sure?

124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,680
No.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,680
Really not

126
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,760
Definitely not

127
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,240
This is Jung-yeon.

128
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,080
This girl has changed a lot

129
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,280
Now she's so well-behaved.

130
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,360
I can’t recognize you.

131
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,480
Thank you, Mrs. Cheng.

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Mr. Cheng is

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,960
and knowledgeable.

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
Speaking of my daughter,

135
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
and Qi

136
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,720
when we were little.

137
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,480
I was just busy with family affairs

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,080
and alienated them.

139
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,120
Brother Zhou is right.

140
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,240
How about this?

141
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Let's find a day

142
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
a family banquet.

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's get together

144
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,080
Let the two kids know

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,680
and have a long talk.

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,720
What do you think?

147
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,280
My daughter,

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,240
Are you willing?

149
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,840
It's all up to you.

150
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,840
This child...

151
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Okay.

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,000
Here, have some tea.

153
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
You said you were afraid of the dark.

154
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,840
I was still like this.

155
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,120
Do you remember

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,720
Why do I suddenly feel that

157
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,720
familiar?

158
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,800
No.

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,000
Mr. Cheng, you’re so skilled.

160
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,240
I really know martial arts.

161
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,240
Young Master.

162
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,400
for a long time.

163
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,480
You must be hungry.

164
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,800
Young Master.

165
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,880
I don't know

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,480
I don't know if you know.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
How would I know if you don't tell me?

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,520
Madam said

169
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
the Double Seventh Festival is in a few days.

170
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
I invited Mr. Zhou and his family

171
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
to travel together.

172
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,240
Mr. Zhou.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,520
Zhou Mang, Minister of Personnel.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
His daughter Zhou Jingyan

175
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,560
is your classmate.

176
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,840
Miss Zhou

177
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,120
looks so shy.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,920
Miss Zhou,

179
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,920
is indeed pure and elegant.

180
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
I think Miss Zhou

181
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
and you

182
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,200
with you.

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
We are just classmates.

184
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Don't talk nonsense.

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm not.

186
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
They look good together.

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:31,960
Change clothes.

188
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,920
Jun Xu.

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
When will you

190
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
come back to us?

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
It's strange.

192
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,360
You're not with us,

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,520
but you remember us clearly.

194
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,280
Cheng Qi was with me,

195
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
but he forgot everything.

196
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,280
Because we are immortals,

197
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,640
because we're immortals?

198
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,800
the pain?

199
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,880
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,480
I know you don't like me.

201
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
when I'm sad.

202
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
But it's okay.

203
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,880
I believe

204
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,880
will be fine.

205
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
I believe you will come back.

206
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
Cheng Qi will regain his memory

207
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,680
and remember you.

208
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Remember me.

209
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,040
Remember all of us.

210
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
Everything will be fine.

211
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,000
right?

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,920
I'll wait for you to come back.

213
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,840
Lin, don't blame him.

214
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
It's the time formation left by the nightmare.

215
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,640
which turned the time around.

216
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
Eldest Young Master, we're here.

217
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,880
Eldest Young Master, I've given you the money.

218
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,160
why are you still looking for this girl?

219
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,520
You won't understand.

220
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,440
No.

221
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
How do you know without telling me?

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,800
I don't understand.

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,680
This Lin

224
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
could go back to heaven

225
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,680
and live a good life.

226
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,480
Why must you guard this shabby temple?

227
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,800
I think

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,600
she still

229
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,760
can't let go of Cheng Qi.

230
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,160
I want to protect him.

231
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,240
I finally

232
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,960
to be an immortal.

233
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,720
What kind of life is this?

234
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Cheng Qi

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
He's alone.

236
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,920
lose memories?

237
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,200
Cheng Qi.

238
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,320
Why didn't you

239
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,080
come in?

240
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,640
How do you know my name?

241
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,000
What are you talking about?

242
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,200
I don't know your name.

243
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,160
By the way,

244
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,280
Lin said he lost his memory.

245
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
Looks like he really forgot.

246
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,880
Right.

247
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,200
Did you hear

248
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,000
what I just said?

249
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,640
No.

250
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,760
You scared me.

251
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,200
If Lin knows

252
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
I badmouthed her,

253
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,840
She must kill me.

254
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,560
Lin.

255
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,640
Is Lin the fairy?

256
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,200
What’s your name?

257
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,240
Goddess.

258
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Who are you calling Goddess?

259
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
Don't you think

260
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
the name "Fairy Goddess" is lame?

261
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,000
You asked me to help you

262
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,400
to recall your past life.

263
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,680
Now you want me to bring back

264
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,600
your memory of this life.

265
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,880
Actually,

266
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
I think

267
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,680
It doesn't matter

268
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,000
it doesn't matter.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,960
It's painful

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,880
is actually a pain.

271
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,800
Do you understand

272
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
what I mean?

273
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,080
Succulent meat.

274
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,320
See this guest out.

275
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,360
It’s time to eat.

276
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,480
Mr. Cheng.

277
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,200
Please.

278
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,320
Mr. Cheng.

279
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,280
My Lin

280
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
is in a bad mood today.

281
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,920
Go back first.

282
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,000
Goddess,

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,600
I came to you today

284
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,280
to ask you

285
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,080
why I know martial arts.

286
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,000
Did you teach me that?

287
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,640
Don't worry.

288
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,120
I'm not here to disturb you.

289
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,040
I just want you

290
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,760
teach me martial arts.

291
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,000
You can learn if you want.

292
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,480
But what price do you have to pay?

293
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,680
Don't say that.

294
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
I know your family is rich.

295
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,520
Go ahead.

296
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,520
Anything you want.

297
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,960
Then

298
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,480
send us back to Cheng Mansion.

299
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,600
No problem.

300
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,640
Please think twice.

301
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,560
Succulent meat.

302
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,520
You can go.

303
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,120
I’m not going.

304
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,720
Mr. Cheng.

305
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,400
If you want to invite her,

306
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,560
you have to show your sincerity.

307
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,760
Eldest Young Master.

308
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,960
Eldest Young Master.

309
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
The sun is too strong.

310
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
Why don't you wait in the car?

311
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,200
No.

312
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,400
It's not sincere to wait in the car.

313
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:22,960
No.

314
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,360
What if you get a heatstroke?

315
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,120
what will you do?

316
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,200
You can go by yourself.

317
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,600
No.

318
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
Ma.

319
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Sorry for making you suffer.

320
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,800
Young Master.

321
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,560
The rain is getting heavier.

322
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,040
You can wait in the carriage.

323
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,480
Get on if you want.

324
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,560
Give me the umbrella.

325
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,600
No.

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
I'll stay with you.
