1
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,200
Brother.

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,880
You can't kill me.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,720
If I die,

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,000
you'll break the law of heaven.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,000
How dare you sign a soul contract with a mortal?

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,040
Since I dare to come to you,

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,120
I should be prepared.

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,200
My good brother.

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,000
I've seen

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,880
your ruthlessness.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,280
You're no longer a god.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,280
Aren't you afraid

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,440
you'll turn into ashes?

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,080
Are you worried about me?

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,240
Let me tell you.

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not the only one

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
like this.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,680
If you kill me,

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,720
It's okay.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,280
But those who signed the contract with me

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,200
who signed the contract with me.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,640
what will happen.

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,680
Is it worth it?

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,360
Is it worth it?

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,920
I love him.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,600
But your love makes you sad.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm pathetic?

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,759
What about you?

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,280
For your integrity,

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,560
your duty

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,320
can never get

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,360
the one you love.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
watch her

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
being with someone else.

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,840
Aren't you pathetic?

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,760
How can you stop?

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
You should know

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,000
what I want.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,600
By the way,

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,880
I have what you want.

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,000
Do you want it?

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,880
Come and get it yourself.

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
Are you done?

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,840
Is it done?

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,560
We're waiting for you.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,160
Here.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Okay.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,440
Here.

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,040
So beautiful.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,120
It's flying so high.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,440
I hope our wish will come true.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,120
Higher.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
If Qi'er can recover,

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
I can do anything

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
for him.

56
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,640
If I can help him,

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,400
if I can help him.

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
But this won't do.

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,320
What if I die

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
what if I die one day?

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,080
Pig.

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,560
Just don't apply it.

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,040
What does it say? It's so dark.

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,480
What wish did you make?

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,720
Carbon.

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,080
You're the one eating carbon.

67
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Shut up.

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,000
Please light the lantern for me.

69
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,440
Is the wish

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,360
has something to do with me?

71
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
What wish did you make?

72
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
I can't tell you my wish.

73
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
It won't come true if I tell you

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,960
No.

75
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,840
Tell me your wish.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,760
If God can't help you,

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,120
I can help you.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
My wish is

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
to recover soon.

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,520
This fairy's wish

81
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,720
has something to do with me.

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,280
As long as you recover,

83
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,720
my Internal Dan will come back.

84
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,480
Because of this,

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,400
You don't have to make a wish.

86
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,480
Of course.

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,560
What else?

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
I wish my wish

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,280
can come true soon.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,120
If she wants it so much,

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
to get her Internal Dan back.

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,080
If I tell her the truth,

93
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,880
If...

94
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
I mean if...

95
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
what if we can't retrieve the Internal Dan?

96
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Are you kidding me?

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,159
No way!

98
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
What if we can't get it back?

99
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Are you kidding?

100
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Jun Xu said

101
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,080
as long as you recover,

102
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
you can return the Internal Dan to me.

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
But Jun Xu said

104
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,360
we can't get it back now.

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,800
What do you mean?

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,800
Sorry.

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,240
Lin, I don't want to lie to you.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,800
My body

109
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,840
has recovered.

110
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,040
But Internal Dan

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,000
and my body

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,120
with my body.

113
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
I can't take it out.

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,800
Lin.

115
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,400
Why?

116
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,160
Shouldn't I

117
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,360
hate him?

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,040
Why do you think

119
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
all his good things?

120
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,600
Xu,

121
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,920
You're still up so late.

122
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Brother Cheng, what can I do for you?

123
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,440
Brother Xu.

124
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,160
I have something

125
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,120
I don't know if it's convenient to ask.

126
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,880
Go ahead.

127
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
If...

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
If I take the Internal Dan

129
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,040
from my body,

130
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,680
and give it back to Lin.

131
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,760
Is there any other way?

132
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,240
If I return the Internal Dan to Lin,

133
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,400
there is only one consequence.

134
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,920
At the price of life.

135
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,720
You mean

136
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
if I return the Internal Dan to Lin,

137
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,280
I will die.

138
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,200
At worst,

139
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,560
I can go back to the old days.

140
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
My heart disease is incurable.

141
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,880
What power?

142
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,800
doesn't belong to mortals.

143
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,640
I don't want them anymore.

144
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,960
You think things are too simple.

145
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,240
Once the Internal Dan

146
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,480
from your body,

147
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,360
will hurt you a lot.

148
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,120
But...

149
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Internal Dan is my life.

150
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,080
and also my life.

151
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,440
Xu,

152
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
You're so good.

153
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,440
There must be another way.

154
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,720
It's already the best result

155
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,200
is the best result.

156
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,520
As long as Lin

157
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
stay by your side all the time,

158
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,200
everything will be fine.

159
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
I can't be so selfish.

160
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Okay, don't worry.

161
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,680
Boss,

162
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
Which line is good?

163
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,680
This one.

164
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,800
The quality is good.

165
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,760
Little gadgets.

166
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,840
Give me a bundle.

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,360
Okay.

168
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,400
Master Yuli,

169
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
About what I told you last time,

170
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,520
If you can get a woman to help you,

171
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,040
you'll be able to do half the work.

172
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,440
Master Yuli.

173
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
Mr. Cheng,

174
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,080
today?

175
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,880
Thanks to Master Yuli,

176
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,640
the Immortal Powder.

177
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,280
I'll be fine after eating it.

178
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,840
But the Immortal Powder

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,840
is just a lifesaving medicine to save the rebellion.

180
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
can't cure your heart disease.

181
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,200
Actually, my heart disease has recovered.

182
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
But my parents don’t know it yet.

183
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,040
So I came to find Master Yuli.

184
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,680
What brings you here

185
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,080
to see me today?

186
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,440
I'm here today

187
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
to ask you a favor.

188
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,320
Go ahead.

189
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,880
Master Yuli,

190
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Can you see

191
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,280
my body is different?

192
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,120
There is something

193
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
that doesn't belong to you.

194
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,520
Indeed.

195
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,160
I came here this time

196
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
to return the Internal Dan

197
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,720
to its original owner.

198
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,960
But the Internal Dan

199
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,760
is the key to your recovery.

200
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,640
Are you sure you want to return it?

201
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,280
Yes.

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,960
Mr. Cheng.

203
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,360
I can take the elixir,

204
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,680
But there's one thing

205
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,720
I have to tell you.

206
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,600
the Internal Dan has integrated

207
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,760
with your body.

208
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,720
Do you know?

209
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,200
I know.

210
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,800
I'll be frank then.

211
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,560
If you want to return the Internal Dan

212
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,240
the Internal Dan,

213
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,120
I'm afraid

214
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,680
your body will be damaged.

215
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,080
or even your life is at stake.

216
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,480
Since this is my fate,

217
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,560
I can’t change others’ fate

218
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,880
because of my fate.

219
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,160
I've made up my mind.

220
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,320
Is it worth it?

221
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm willing to exchange my life

222
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,240
for Lin's future.

223
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,160
Okay.

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,960
I'll help you with this.

225
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
I will divide the Internal Dan

226
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,960
into two.

227
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,600
This process may be painful,

228
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,800
but

229
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,000
at least I can save your life.

230
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,480
As for Lin,

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,200
she is not a mortal.

232
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,480
She can use cultivation

233
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
through cultivation.

234
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
You don't have to worry.

235
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
But what I want to tell you is

236
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,960
once the Internal Dan

237
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,080
from your body,

238
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,440
even half of the Internal Dan

239
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
it will still put your life in danger.

240
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,080
Thank you, Master Yuli.

241
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,000
I see.

242
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,160
Your Majesty.

243
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,080
Get up.

244
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,880
My body.

245
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
[my body?]

246
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
I think

247
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,880
I think he's suitable.

248
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
But I still need to take care of him for a few days.

249
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,280
Good.

250
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,200
By the way, Your Highness,

251
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,280
I have good news for you.

252
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,119
I found them.

253
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,200
I really miss them.
