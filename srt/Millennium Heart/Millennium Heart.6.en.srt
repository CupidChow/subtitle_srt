1
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,280
Are you okay?

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm fine.

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,080
Yesterday,

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,280
I went to the back street

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
to the back street.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,640
What happened?

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,240
Why can't I

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,200
remember anything.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,000
Lin.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:41,880
Lin.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
You saved me yesterday.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,200
I was just passing by.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,520
Why did you

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,800
such a romantic place?

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
It's none of your business.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,560
I'll go

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,640
to visit Mrs. Cheng.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,800
See what she says.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,039
I was worried about you.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,600
About what?

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm worried that you'll be eaten by a demon.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,480
By the way,

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,520
why did you

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,039
passed out there yesterday?

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,720
I don't know.

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,160
That place is full of demonic aura.

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,760
Maybe it's because

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,240
I can't resist it

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,680
so I can't resist it.

30
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,360
But it's strange.

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
Logically speaking,

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,360
even if I have no power,

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,759
I wouldn't have fainted.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,720
Why do you have my necklace?

35
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,080
Don't wear it.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Don't wear it.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,680
Don't wear it.

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
Don't worry. It won't happen.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
According to what I saw last night,

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,600
that demon

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
is not that easy to deal with.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,120
It should be a vicious demon.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,160
There might be more than one.

44
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
More than one.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,560
What is this?

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,640
Demon Binding Rope.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,640
is specially used

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,520
those demons.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,560
And this.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
What is this?

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,640
Don't underestimate it.

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
If you stick it on people,

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,040
he will do

54
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,000
what you did.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,480
In this world,

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
in this world.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,920
This is amazing.

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
This is called Spiritual Seeking Ball.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
It can distinguish the evil spirit

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,080
by the color of the ball.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,920
the evil spirit is.

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,960
We'll know if it's good or bad.

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,560
Amazing, right?

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,440
These are

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,480
are the things

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,680
have collected

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,760
in Jianghu.

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,240
Awesome.

69
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,079
Awesome.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,360
By the way,

71
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,960
Didn't you visit the demon yesterday?

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,120
How did it go?

73
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,880
Boss.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,920
One more skewers.

75
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,320
Okay.

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,680
I asked you about the investigation.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,360
I went to

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,320
Hongli went to the brothel.

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,200
But I found

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
there were no demons.

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,600
No demon?

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,440
I lied to you.

83
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,040
No way.

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,480
Big.

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Big.

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,720
Are you done?

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,560
Of course not.

88
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,920
Of course not.

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,640
Have you had enough fun?

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,560
Yes

91
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,920
Get to work if you're done

92
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,880
What are you waiting for? Help me.

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
Will this work?

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
What if someone dies?

95
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Just leave it.

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,600
If I don't,

97
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
he'll really die.

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
She looks cool

99
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,320
is quite cool.

100
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,000
This color

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,960
is exactly the same

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,520
I saw that night.

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,200
What's the smell?

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,480
The smell of a demon.

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,760
This is definitely not

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,680
an ordinary transformer demon.

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,120
This demon is so complicated.

108
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,840
even I can't tell.

109
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
Hong Li's condition

110
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,840
is very bad.

111
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,840
We have to find

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,560
the source.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,280
By the way,

114
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,320
Isn't Hong Li

115
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
with Cheng Di that day?

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,920
Is Cheng Di also...

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,159
How could they

118
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,040
be together?

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
There's no time to talk.

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,480
Let's go.

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,320
Slow down.

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,000
I want more.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What do you want to drink? How much did you drink?

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,520
Here.

125
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,240
Watch out!

126
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,360
Let's go.

127
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,360
Get ready.

128
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,520
I'll use the Settlement Jutsu first.

129
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,360
You answer my question.

130
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
What are you doing?

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,800
Who are you?

132
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,360
It's none of your business. Shut up.

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,240
Cheng Qi.

134
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,680
Don't go too far.

135
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,680
You...

136
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,080
What are you doing?

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
Help!

138
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,560
Murder!

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,159
How is it?

140
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,159
No.

141
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:44,960
Wake up.

142
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:47,960
You...

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,760
What are you doing?

144
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,040
Let me ask you.

145
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
Where have you been these days?

146
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Why should I tell you?

147
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,320
If you don't tell me,

148
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,280
now,

149
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
I can take this woman

150
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
to Mr. Cheng.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,600
No.

152
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,440
I'll tell you.

153
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,160
I went to

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
Wanhua Pavilion.

155
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
Flower Inn?

156
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,400
Cheng Di

157
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
You are at age of age.

158
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
You haven't come of age yet.

159
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
How can you go to such a brothel?

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Let me ask you.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Yesterday,

162
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
why did you bring Hongli?

163
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,880
How do you know?

164
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,720
Will you tell me?

165
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,160
I will.

166
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,200
Say it.

167
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,440
I wanted to take Brother Hong

168
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
to have fun there.

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,240
But when he went in,

170
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,360
he scared

171
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,200
away.

172
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm scared

173
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,000
he ran away.

174
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,880
So I drove him away.

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,800
Where did he go?

176
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
I don't know.

177
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,520
Maybe...

178
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
Maybe he went to the gambling house.

179
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,360
Gambling house? Yes.

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Brother Hong.

181
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,720
Brother Cheng, I don't know how to do this.

182
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,240
It’s OK. Don’t be afraid.

183
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,560
Gentlemen.

184
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,400
No.

185
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,960
I've got your money.

186
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,520
Big.

187
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,280
Then...

188
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,040
Small.

189
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,280
I'll try.

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,520
I...

191
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,240
Big.

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:01,960
OK.

193
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,200
Place your bets.

194
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,560
Big. Big.

195
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,400
Small.

196
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,760
Big.

197
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,800
Four, five, six, big.

198
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,960
Did I win?

199
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes.

200
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,440
I won!

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
It's your first time here.

202
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
for the first time.

203
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,360
I don't know why.

204
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,920
God is helping me.

205
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:19,960
Well...

206
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Here.

207
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,200
Like this.

208
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
You can bet.

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,480
I...

210
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,560
One more time.

211
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,960
Big or small?

212
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,680
Open.

213
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
Double six, one three.

214
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,800
Cheng, I won again.

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,640
Place your bets.

216
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,000
Big.

217
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
Big

218
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,360
Big.

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,520
Big.

220
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,240
Big.

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,000
Big.

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,720
Big.

223
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,400
Big, big, big.

224
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,240
Small.

225
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,800
Big, big, small.

226
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,000
They're all mine.

227
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,520
All mine.

228
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,280
Again.

229
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,160
Brother Hong, what's wrong?

230
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Let's go back.

231
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,240
Again.

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Big.

233
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Big.

234
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,280
Since I took him

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
with him,

236
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,320
he often went crazy

237
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,400
like crazy.

238
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,600
Cheng Di

239
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,520
How dare you!

240
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,200
You’ve ruined

241
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,160
our family’s reputation.

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,800
Brother.

243
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I won't do it again.

244
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,200
For the sake

245
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
for the sake of our brothers,

246
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,880
please let me go.

247
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,680
You have nothing to do here.

248
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,640
Leave.

249
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,640
Wait.

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,360
Miss, take the money.

251
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,960
Don't talk nonsense.

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,720
Thank you.

253
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:44,840
It tickles.

254
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,920
What did you do?

255
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,920
It tickles.

256
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,040
Within five years,

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,800
you must not get close to women.

258
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Otherwise, you'll feel itchy.

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
It will be painful.

260
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,840
Remember, cousin.

261
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
You will forget

262
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
what happened today.

263
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,160
and never tell anyone.

264
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,200
Right?

265
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,160
Let's go.

266
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,920
Untie me.

267
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
Don't go, Cheng Qi.

268
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,520
Wait.

269
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,320
This place

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,840
a special barrier.

271
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
We may not be able to enter.

272
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,640
Why can't I see it?

273
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
You're not a demon.

274
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,640
Get out of the way!

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,360
I mean you have no eyes.

276
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,080
You're in my way.

277
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,880
Don't block my way.

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll deal with you later.

279
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,320
Did you see that?

280
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
There's something in his eyes.

281
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
How can you see this again?

282
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Otherwise, how can he get in

283
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,840
this barrier?

284
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Greed.

285
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,240
Only those who are greedy

286
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
can enter this barrier.

287
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,360
Almost.

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,000
How can we get in here?

289
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,440
You need to use it.

290
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,720
This can

291
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,800
the emotions

292
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,920
to himself.

293
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,760
Brother.

294
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,720
Do you want a mirror?

295
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,760
This mirror is made well.

296
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
It's of good quality and cheap quality.

297
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,960
It's the best.

298
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
You want me to see

299
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm penniless?

300
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,400
Get lost!

301
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,960
Get lost!

302
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,720
This is so miserable.

303
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,000
Just now,

304
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,400
I have put his greed

305
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
into the mirror.

306
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,320
Now only the three of us

307
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,120
face the mirror.

308
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,920
Focus.

309
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,680
and tell them money.

310
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
Remember to be clear-minded.

311
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,560
Hurry up.

312
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't be blinded by

313
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,360
by the emotions in the mirror.

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Got it?

315
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay.

316
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,560
Three, two, one.

317
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,040
Come on.

318
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,600
Big.

319
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,640
Big

320
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,200
Small.

321
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,480
Small.

322
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
Big

323
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,640
Big.

324
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,680
Big.

325
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
Big, small.

326
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,160
I won!

327
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,000
It's all mine.

328
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,800
We won!

329
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,640
We won!

330
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,640
This feels so bad.

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
I don't feel well.

332
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,520
Cheng Qi.

333
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,360
Are you okay?

334
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm fine.

335
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,120
Let's go in.

336
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,280
Let's go.

337
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,960
Hurry up!

338
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,960
Small.

339
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,080
Big.

340
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,400
Open.

341
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,000
Hurry up.

342
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,560
Bet.

343
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,440
Big.

344
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,320
Open it!

345
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,960
We won!

346
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
I won!

347
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,160
Let's go over there.

348
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,400
We can win.

349
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,440
Big!

350
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Big.

351
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,080
Why is everyone here

352
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,960
are so crazy?

353
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,920
Hurry. Big.

354
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,520
Of course it's because of greed.

355
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,160
Big or small. Place your bets.

356
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,720
Big. Big. Big.

357
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,000
Big big big

358
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,640
Wait.

359
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
Eat this first.

360
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,520
What is this?

361
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,480
Demon-repelling Pill.

362
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,040
can alleviate

363
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,400
the influence on you.

364
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,040
Eat.

365
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Place your bets

366
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,520
Look at the dealer.

367
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
Place your bets!

368
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,640
Hurry up.

369
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,680
Hurry up.

370
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,760
Is he different?

371
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,360
Are you ready?

372
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:55,880
Yes.

373
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,680
Hurry up.

374
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,280
Open it!

375
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
Open it!

376
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,880
Go.

377
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,960
Kill all leopard.

378
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,320
Come on.

379
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,440
Again.

380
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,240
Gosh.

381
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,760
What is it?

382
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,320
It's mine!

383
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Beast.

384
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
It's usually based on human desires

385
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,840
and resentment.

386
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,560
Look at how greedy he is.

387
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,720
I think

388
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
the people in this gambling house

389
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
from the people in this gambling house.

390
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,080
And he can

391
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
absorb human blood.

392
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
Look at the one opposite him.

393
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,200
One, two, five, small.

394
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,960
I won.

395
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
It's just a little strange.

396
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
With his power,

397
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,440
it shouldn't be enough

398
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,520
such a strong demon aura.

399
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,680
There must be other demons, succulent meat.

400
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,040
Take Cheng Qi to the second floor.

401
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,240
I'll deal with him.

402
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,120
Okay.

403
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,240
Come with me.

404
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,320
Come on. Let's continue.

405
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,080
Go on.

406
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,000
Come on, don't move.

407
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,000
Place your bets.

408
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,760
Hurry up.

409
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
I'm not talented.

410
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
Can I play a few games with you?

411
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
What can you play?

412
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,640
Don't mess around. That's right.

413
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,440
Go away.

414
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,600
Come on, let's continue.

415
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
Go on. Come on.

416
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll bet big.

417
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,240
Small.

418
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,760
Big.

419
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,600
I won't win.

420
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,480
Can't you afford to lose?

421
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:18,960
Hurry.

422
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,200
Place your bets.

423
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,520
Small.

424
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,080
Small.

425
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,480
Big.

426
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,400
Small.

427
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,760
Open it.

428
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,960
This...

429
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,160
Why is it broken?

430
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,840
How do you calculate this?

431
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
What's going on?

432
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,200
I don't know what's going on.

433
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,720
Pay for it.

434
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,520
Exactly.

435
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,080
He took all our money.

436
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,480
Right?

437
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,880
Let's see where you can escape today.

438
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,600
How much strength

439
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,200
to shake it?

440
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,160
Pay me!

441
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Pay the price.

442
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,320
Yes.

443
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,120
Pay me.

444
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,680
Humans are heartless.

445
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,520
It's instinct to seek advantage and avoid harm.

446
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
As a human,

447
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,040
Why risk your life?

448
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,680
You...

449
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,080
Who are you?

450
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,880
Are you a human or a demon?

451
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,160
I am you.

452
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,480
You gave birth to me.

453
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,319
I am the nature of your desires.

454
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,920
Your greed summoned me.

455
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,359
and released me.

456
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,280
and stronger me.

457
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,920
We are both demons.

458
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
I have no grudge against you.

459
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,320
Why are you chasing me?

460
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,440
You know the answer.

461
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,480
The aura of desire

462
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,320
the aura of desire

463
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,240
is good for you, right?

464
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,720
As a demon,

465
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,720
not only do you have endless rules,

466
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,760
and did evil,

467
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,640
He even won't spare the students.

468
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,880
I'm a demon.

469
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,640
Student.

470
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,360
Only those who can be devoured by me

471
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,040
are people with extreme desires.

472
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,080
are ordinary.

473
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,640
You should be punished.

474
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm just doing justice for God.

475
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
To get rid of evil for the people.

476
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,440
Execute justice for heaven!

477
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
How dare you say that?

478
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
I've never seen a demon

479
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
who hurt people.

480
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,960
Today,

481
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
I'll take you in first.
