1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,920
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,960
I think you should forget it.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
Why are you drawing a kite?

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,760
You can't even draw a person well.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,160
Don't disturb my creation.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,600
It's a person. It's a person. It's a person.

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,720
It's a person.

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,800
Can't you tell?

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,080
This is too ugly.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,560
I suddenly remembered

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,480
what the bottle my mother bought

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,120
at your place last time?

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,520
Yurong cream.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
You drew it too?

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,600
Of course.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,480
Our Lin

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,160
created their own names.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,080
Names?

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,480
My mother and I...

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,400
for a long time.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
I couldn't guess what that was.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,640
This is just a bun.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,920
Buns?

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
That's a dragon scale.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,920
Dragon scale?

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,280
Miss,

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,920
Do you have any misunderstanding

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,680
about the Dragon Scale?

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,759
I suddenly remembered

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,320
I have something important to do.

31
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:49,840
Goodbye.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
I... I was wrong.

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,360
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
I can finally focus on writing.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,120
Young Master.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,680
according to your order,

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
to Miss Lin

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,960
to Lin.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,600
What is she doing?

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,600
She's just spacing out.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,240
The waste paper is piled up.

42
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,400
Draw.

43
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,680
Let her draw.

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,400
If she needs

45
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
she needs,

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
to her.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
I didn't expect this little demon

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
can hold on.

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,520
My mother and I

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
for a long time.

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
I couldn't guess what it was.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,440
Is it a bun?

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,760
Miss,

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,160
Do you have any misunderstanding

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,960
about the Dragon Scale?

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,800
I don't believe

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,000
I have to

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
something this time.

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
Why can I breathe in water?

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,640
When you can completely

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,800
control the Internal Dan,

63
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
you will recover.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Could it be...

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,240
I can completely

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,079
control the Internal Dan.

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,560
That means

68
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,320
I've recovered.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,760
I did it!

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,240
I did it.

71
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,320
Miss Lin.

72
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
Miss Lin.

73
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Young Master said

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,200
we must

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
you must tie the kite well.

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,880
Do you understand?

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's start.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,720
Okay.

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,360
The distance should be the same.

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,760
Okay.

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,640
Wait.

82
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,120
I fell asleep last night.

83
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,480
Who made this for me?

84
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,560
Whatever.

85
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
You're not good at throwing, extra meat.

86
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,600
Let's go over there.

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,360
Okay.

88
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,560
Is it far?

89
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
Be careful.

90
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,120
Yeah, I can beat seven anyway.

91
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,480
I'll call you later.

92
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,880
Find the stone first.

93
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,159
Okay.

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
This is actually a good place.

95
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,760
Mr. Hong.

96
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:53,960
Let's go.

97
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,720
I didn't expect you to be such a good cook.

98
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,680
You can even

99
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
such a beautiful kite.

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
The kite

101
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,200
is better than a girl's house.

102
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,480
Mr. Hong's kite

103
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,560
is really good.

104
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,560
It's exquisite and neat.

105
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,680
Unbelievable.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,960
It was made by a man.

107
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
Thank you.

108
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
We'll go first.

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,160
Let's go.

110
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,920
Let's go over there.

111
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
Let's go over there.

112
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,880
There's a sheep.

113
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,840
Nonsense.

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
Come on, this way.

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,240
Come on, hurry up.

116
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,920
Follow me.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,440
Run! Run!

118
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,800
Hurry!

119
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Cheng Lin.

120
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,520
What are you pricking?

121
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,080
Slow down.

122
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah.

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
Looks like

124
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
I can't fly at all.

125
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,920
Yeah.

126
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,400
I think Cheng Lin's kite

127
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
is very unique.

128
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,520
Didn't you say that...

129
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes, I did.

130
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,480
I told you to give me

131
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,080
to me.

132
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,440
So,

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,080
do you really like this kite?

134
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Of course.

135
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,000
Jung-yeon.

136
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Let's put it in the front.

137
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,200
Let's go.

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
Yes, let's fly a kite.

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay.

140
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,720
Come on.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
You're so funny.

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,400
Maybe you can see

143
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,120
what I pricked.

144
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,320
It's a dragon head.

145
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,400
Dragon.

146
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,360
Then...

147
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,360
Let's play it together.

148
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
Be careful not to fall down.

149
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,880
Come here

150
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Ready to run

151
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,520
OK?

152
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,440
Yes

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,240
Succulent meat.

154
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Our kite

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,920
fly the highest.

156
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Lin, look.

157
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,720
How high is Hongli's kite flying?

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,360
Let me play for a while.

159
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,800
Okay.

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
Look how high I fly.

161
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,280
Be careful.

162
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,840
Why are they

163
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,800
fly so high?

164
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,400
We can't put up ours.

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,960
Forget it.

166
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,640
No.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
Do you think their kite

168
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
fly?

169
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,520
Of course not.

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Look at her.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's so long.

172
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,920
I won't let it go.

173
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,960
So high.

174
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,400
Lin,

175
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,480
You always

176
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,400
never give up.

177
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,920
We must put it down.

178
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,520
Let them see.

179
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,520
But we've been keeping it for so long.

180
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,240
It hasn't improved much.

181
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,960
I promise I can put it down.

182
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,120
Let me help you.

183
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Run to me.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,520
Come on.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,320
Slow down.

186
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,200
Slow down.

187
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,040
Run faster.

188
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Let go!

189
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,480
It's flying!

190
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,480
Is there anyone who slips?

191
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,640
I...

192
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,480
Run faster.

193
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,480
Over there.

194
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,360
I told you to let go.

195
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,360
Okay.

196
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,920
Are you ready?

197
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,080
Look.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,480
Their kite is so long.

199
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
It's hard to fly, right?

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
Can it fly?

201
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
It's so long.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
So big.

203
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,880
Put it down.

204
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,960
It can't fly, right?

205
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
You look up. Get up.

206
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,200
It's flying.

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
Amazing!

208
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,600
Look how high they fly.

209
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,080
Amazing!

210
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,240
It's flying.

211
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,400
Is it okay?

212
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
This is so beautiful.

213
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,440
Jung-yeon, Myo-ah.

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,280
Did I see it wrong?

215
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,480
The kite is flying.

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
A lot of meat.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,120
Their kite is flying

218
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,280
What a cool dragon!

219
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
So beautiful

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,720
So pretty.

221
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,160
Look, it's getting higher.

222
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,560
You're amazing.

223
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,440
Amazing!

224
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,720
Our dragon is flying!

225
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
The dragon is flying!

226
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,920
I said it would work.

227
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
You're amazing, Cheng Qi.

228
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,840
You're amazing.

229
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,000
Jing Yan, don't you think

230
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,440
since Cheng Lin came,

231
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,360
Mr. Cheng has changed.

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,120
Yeah.

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Mr. Cheng has never seen him

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,880
so close to a woman.

235
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,320
I just said

236
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
I can put it down.

237
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,040
I didn't expect Cheng Qi

238
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Cheng Qi

239
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,640
when he smiles.

240
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,640
I want to try it too.

241
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,800
Here.

242
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,520
Like this?

243
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,880
Let me teach you.

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,800
Release the line.

245
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,640
Yes.

246
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,360
Slowly.

247
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

248
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,720
Be careful.

249
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,840
Wait for me.

250
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,560
It's so high.

251
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,160
So beautiful.

252
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,520
Maybe next time

253
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
try one next time?

254
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,120
Look.

255
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
It's higher than before.

256
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
We can try it then.

257
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
They're amazing.

258
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,040
Can you carry it?

259
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,880
It flies so high.

260
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,600
Yuri.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,520
It's really you.

262
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,520
What are you doing here?

263
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
Don't you know

264
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
what I want to do?

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
You almost made a big mistake before.

266
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
Why are you still unrepentant today?

267
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm just like you.

268
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,240
for my mission.

269
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,960
Mission?

270
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,880
Your mission

271
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,280
can let you go against the law of heaven.

272
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,440
and refuse to acknowledge your family?

273
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Now,

274
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
kill me now.

275
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
I know they are here.

276
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
Tell me.

277
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,120
that woman is Shamo.

278
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
Where is Ao Qi?

279
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,080
Where is he?

280
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I won't tell you.

281
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
You won't tell me?

282
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,400
Your expression has betrayed you.

283
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
I guess I was right.

284
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
You...

285
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,760
No. Shut up.

286
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,240
You thought I wouldn't know

287
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,920
without telling me

288
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
where they are.

289
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,880
You underestimate Yuri.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,720
We will meet again.

291
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,760
Hey.

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,240
Look!

293
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,360
It's flying so high.

294
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,360
It's getting higher

295
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
Okay, Jung-yeon.

296
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,960
Don't be mad. Have some water.

297
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,080
No.

298
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,320
I'm so angry.

299
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,800
How about this?

300
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,360
I help you to treat them?

301
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,800
Yes, slow down.

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
But are you sure?

303
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,520
Just leave it.

304
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,240
Watch closely.

305
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,160
Miao'er.

306
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,320
Are you okay?

307
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,720
Yes.

308
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,600
Very good.

309
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,240
Be careful.

310
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,240
What's going on?

311
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,720
Their line dropped.

312
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,240
They took off their hands.

313
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Hurry up.

314
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,400
Are you okay?

315
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,080
Hurry up! Catch it!

316
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,200
Hurry, catch it.

317
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
Lin, be careful.

318
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,640
It fell.

319
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,200
What should we do

320
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,440
Jung-yeon, run!

321
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,760
Be careful

322
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Be careful.

323
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,360
Watch out!

324
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,040
Move!

325
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,720
Run!

326
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,280
Move!

327
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,200
Move!

328
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Get out of the way!

329
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,040
Run!

330
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
Run

331
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,880
Fall.

332
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,880
Hurry up.

333
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,600
Go help her.

334
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,640
Jung-yeon

335
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,400
Jung-yeon!

336
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,120
Are you okay?

337
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,840
Are you hurt?

338
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,960
It's too dangerous.

339
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,160
It's so heavy.

340
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,280
You can't catch it.

341
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,640
We're too close.

342
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,440
That’s too much.

343
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,560
Cheng Lin

344
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,640
must have done it on purpose.

345
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,080
Wanwan, am I right?

346
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,920
Cheng Lin.

347
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,320
Maybe he didn’t mean it.

348
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,640
Maybe it was an accident.

349
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,320
But Jung-yeon

350
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,960
in public,

351
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,160
we can’t let it go.

352
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,840
Zhang Wanwan.

353
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
Don't talk nonsense if you can't speak.

354
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,280
Jung-yeon.

355
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,600
It's okay

356
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,120
We're all classmates today.

357
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,680
We've been protecting you.

358
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,440
I believe no one saw it.

359
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Don't cry.

360
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,600
Your makeup is messed up.

361
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,680
How about this?

362
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
Let Wanwan go to Cuixiang Pavilion

363
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,320
to buy you the latest fragrance powder.

364
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,720
Pick one.

365
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
your favorite osmanthus fragrance.

366
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,480
What do you think?

367
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
I'll go.

368
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,280
Then what?

369
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,840
You want Jeong-yeon to go alone?

370
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,880
It's okay.

371
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,440
It's so late.

372
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Why don't you go back to your room to rest?

373
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,720
I can't sleep.

374
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:22,960
What about you?

375
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,599
Why aren't you sleeping?

376
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,120
The moon is beautiful tonight.

377
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,720
So I came out to admire the moon.

378
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,520
Look at the moon.
