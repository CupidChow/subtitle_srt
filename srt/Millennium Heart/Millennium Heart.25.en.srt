1
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,840
It's not real

2
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,680
It's not true.

3
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,440
I must still be in my dream.

4
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
How is Lin?

5
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,840
Lin.

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Lin is fine.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,360
What's wrong?

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,479
You look so pale.

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,320
Why do I feel

10
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,400
you're acting weird today?

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,680
Are you hiding something?

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Did you

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,600
last night?

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Go back to sleep.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,480
I'll take care of Lin.

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,240
Thank you. Thank you.

17
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,680
Mother.

18
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
It's raining so heavily.

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Why don't you go back to your room and rest?

20
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,320
Qi, have a seat.

21
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,480
I have something to tell you.

22
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,079
Mother must have heard

23
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,480
the rumors

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
to blame me.

25
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,760
Qi.

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,480
You've grown up.

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,520
I didn't want to ask

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,720
I didn't want to ask,

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
and I didn't want to interfere.

30
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,000
I know you and I trust you.

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
You and Lin

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
love each other.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,320
I saw it too.

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,640
I didn't expect

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
this would happen.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,160
Your father is still angry.

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
I dare not leave this house.

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,079
I'm afraid I'll hear

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
gossip again.

40
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,200
At our age,

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,320
I can't take it.

42
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,280
I'm sorry, Mother.

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
It's all my fault.

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,960
I made you worry.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
I've sent someone

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
to explain

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,840
to Miss Zhou.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,160
In my heart,

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
in my heart.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,360
irreplaceable.

51
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
I've sent someone to take her home.

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,760
But she caught a cold.

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,240
She has a high fever and is still unconscious.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,840
When she wakes up,

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
when she wakes up.

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Mother,

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,760
trust me one more time.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,680
I won't let

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
my mother's trust,

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
I won’t let you down.

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Qi.

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,440
I have always trusted you.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,480
By the way, Mother,

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
I have another question.

65
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,320
What is it?

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
The ancient book

67
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,040
the ancient book

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,520
where it is?

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,040
The heirloom of our ancestors.

70
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
except your father,

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,360
except your father.

72
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,920
He never mentioned

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
the place of the book collection.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,080
What do you want this book for?

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,360
Nothing.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
I'm just curious.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,600
Just asking.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
Mother, take a rest.

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,040
I’ll go check on Lin.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,720
Qi.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,320
I seem to have heard about it from your father.

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,200
that our ancestral books

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,320
should be presented at the gentleman's meeting.

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,320
at the gentleman's meeting.

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,440
Did you bring

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
the thing I want?

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,960
Master.

88
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,800
We haven't

89
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,680
the treasure.

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Believe it or not,

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,840
I'll kill you now!

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
Master, please calm down.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,320
I heard that the legendary book

94
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,000
will be presented at the gentleman's meeting.

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,560
By then, the people in Lincheng

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,760
will be able to see his face.

97
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,280
Please have mercy.

98
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
Don't kill us.

99
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,360
I don't care about a gentleman.

100
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
Within three days,

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,440
If you don't bring

102
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,320
I want,

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
I'll kill you.

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,080
Hurry up! Hurry up!

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,480
Hurry.

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,080
Mother.

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
Where am I?

108
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,680
Lin.

109
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,360
Lin, you’re awake.

110
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,680
We’re in Cheng Mansion.

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Cheng Mansion?

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,720
Yes.

113
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,680
If it weren't for Cheng Qi,

114
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,600
sent us back in time,

115
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm afraid you'll die.

116
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Cheng Qi.

117
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
Where is Cheng Qi?

118
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
I need to find him.

119
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,080
I have something to ask him.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,200
What's the rush?

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
You just recovered.

122
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,800
I know you have something

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,680
to tell Cheng Qi.

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,000
Cheng Qi has a lot

125
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,800
to tell you.

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
But can you...

127
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:04,960
Lin.

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,480
Lin.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,960
Lin.

130
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,320
Do you feel

131
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,880
uncomfortable?

132
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,840
Succulent meat

133
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
Go get some water

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,320
Okay.

135
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,760
Drink it up.

136
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,600
You guys talk.

137
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
I'll get something to eat.

138
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,760
I have something to tell you.

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Actually,

140
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
I was really drunk that day.

141
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,520
I don't know why

142
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,400
I had hallucinations.

143
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,080
That's why

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
as you.

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,200
including what I said to her.

146
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
are all to you.

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,920
Do you still hate me

148
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,600
for not believing me?

149
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,320
It's my fault, right?

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,000
You...

151
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
You really don't blame me anymore?

152
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,720
I swear.

153
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
if I do something

154
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,080
make you unhappy again,

155
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,799
I'll do it every day.

156
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,880
I don't need your promise.

157
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
I just want to see

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
what you will do in the future.

159
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,680
Don't worry.

160
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,840
I won't do

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,800
let you down.

162
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,080
Cheng Qi.

163
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
I finally know

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,080
what I am.

165
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,320
So

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm not a fairy.

167
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,760
but Bong-sun.

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,360
I know.

169
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,800
You're a fairy.

170
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,120
That's what I wanted to tell you.

171
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
So the murals and dreams

172
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,400
are true

173
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,640
That's not

174
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,760
on others.

175
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,560
but...

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,440
We...

177
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
[Our encounter]

178
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,520
Is it destiny?

179
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,680
Why is all this?

180
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,520
Why do I think

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,080
everything

182
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
everything is like a plan.

183
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,920
I believe

184
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,000
someone

185
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,920
can give us an answer.

186
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,640
You mean...

187
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,160
Jun Xu.

188
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Since Lin has forgiven you,

189
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
I have no reason to pursue it.

190
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
I just hope

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
make the same mistake again.

192
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,760
I won't.

193
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,560
What do you want from me?

194
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,840
Xu,

195
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,520
I'm here to ask you

196
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,600
if you know who we are.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,560
not a mortal?

198
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,160
I am the son of the dragon.

199
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,920
And Lin

200
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,400
is Fengxian.

201
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,280
right?

202
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
Why do you know

203
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,800
our identity

204
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
our identity.

205
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,080
Ao Qi.

206
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
You're finally awake.

207
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

208
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,960
Now,

209
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,400
you finally did it.

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,200
That's right.

211
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
You are indeed an ancient dragon.

212
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,200
And Lin

213
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
is indeed Fengxian.

214
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,280
You were once deities of the fairy realm.

215
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,280
to protect the divine memorandum together.

216
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
The Book of Heaven is an ancient treasure.

217
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,680
It suppresses the soul hall of the fairy realm.

218
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,320
The Soul Hall suppresses all evil spirits.

219
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
But the nightmare remains to take the divine memorandum

220
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
and unify the Three Realms.

221
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,480
So he slaughtered in the fairy realm.

222
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,320
Thus, all the demons

223
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,040
into the mortal world.

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
The world is in chaos.

225
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,520
was your sacrifice.

226
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,320
That's why I didn't get the divine memorandum.

227
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,760
Lin has been in chaos for 3,000 years.

228
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,520
is a heart-protecting scale

229
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
before you died.

230
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,840
saved her life

231
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,880
and kept her soul.

232
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
and reincarnate.

233
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,480
And you will be reincarnated

234
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
and become a mortal.

235
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
I can't tell you

236
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
because I can't reveal the secret.

237
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,920
I can only wait for you to awaken.

238
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,760
In that case,

239
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,040
my mission in Heaven Realm with Lin

240
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
is to protect the divine memorandum.

241
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,800
Only when the Book of Heaven returns,

242
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
can the Three Realms balance.

243
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,960
And this matter

244
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
can only depend on you two.

245
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,160
Who is the nightmare?

246
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
In the dream,

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
he killed us.

248
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
He was a deity.

249
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
but he became a rebellious immortal.

250
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,080
He practiced witchcraft secretly

251
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,640
and got possessed.

252
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,840
and became

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
a devil.

254
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,360
I think

255
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,560
you'll meet soon.

256
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,520
The nightmare has been reborn.

257
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
He's in the dark and you're in the light.

258
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,360
Once the Book of Heaven appears,

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,280
this war is inevitable.

260
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
Could it be...

261
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,520
I've been living in a nightmare...

262
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
and wanted to take the divine memorandum.

263
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,360
He never

264
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,040
give up.

265
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,800
Now that you are awakened,

266
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,240
it's God's will.

267
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
If we don't fight,

268
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,240
if we don't fight?

269
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,520
Once the Mirror retrieves the divine memorandum,

270
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,360
the world will be in chaos.

271
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
Once he opens the Book of Heaven,

272
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,760
he will master the Mystery Magic in the world

273
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,160
and surpass the Three Realms and jump out of the Five Elements.

274
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,560
If he successfully opens it,

275
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,600
the fairy realm can't do anything about him.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,720
By then,

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,040
the fairy realm and the mortal world

278
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
are under his control.

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
But I don't have any power

280
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,280
nor the Internal Dan.

281
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
How can we resist the nightmare?

282
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,720
That's right.

283
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,760
Why am I awakened with signs?

284
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,880
while Lin woke up

285
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,320
has no signs.

286
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,760
In fact, Lin

287
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,680
also has

288
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,680
an Internal Dan that belongs to me.

289
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,040
In that battle,

290
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,520
her Internal Dan was captured by a nightmare.

291
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,640
When she was about to

292
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
when her soul was about to disappear,

293
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,920
the Internal Dan was given to

294
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
my sister Yuli.

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,000
And this Internal Dan

296
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,240
in Yuli's body.

297
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,240
I tried many times to get it,

298
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,200
but I failed.

299
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,080
Master Yuli is your sister.

300
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,480
Yuli.

301
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,800
Let’s go practice.

302
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,400
No.

303
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,920
You guys go ahead.

304
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,680
I have to go.

305
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,720
That's right.

306
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,800
She is indeed my sister.

307
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,080
But she has a special identity.

308
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
She is neither an immortal

309
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,320
nor a demon.

310
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
She's a half-fairy.

311
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
And she fell in love with the nightmare.

312
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,000
and tried her best

313
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,000
to get the divine memorandum for him.

314
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
I tried to stop him,

315
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,400
but it didn't work.

316
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,280
Then why did she

317
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
she approached me and Cheng Qi

318
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,920
To find you,

319
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,880
and control you.

320
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,280
and help Dream get the divine memorandum.

321
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,200
So this time,

322
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,520
how will we

323
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,480
protect the Book of Heaven?

324
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,440
I can only rely on you

325
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,440
together.

326
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,880
Mother.

327
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,760
I want to stay with nightmare.

328
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,240
What?

329
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,360
No!

330
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
You're breaking the law of heaven.

331
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,480
Do you know

332
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,920
The nightmare has turned into a rebellious immortal.

333
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,880
He can't even

334
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,880
even himself.

335
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,720
He may be trapped in the Soul Hall at any time.

336
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,880
I want to be with him.

337
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,320
You...

338
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
If it weren't for it,

339
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
I would still

340
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
for my inferiority complex.

341
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,800
Only he doesn't dislike me.

342
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,360
Why can't I follow him?

343
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,080
I told you.

344
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,600
No means no.

345
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,680
There's no reason.

346
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,240
Mother.

347
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,160
You were taken away by that demon.

348
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,680
I was born unfortunately.

349
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
If I hadn't been saved by the Grand Immortal,

350
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,000
you would have surrendered to

351
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,440
You...

352
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,320
Yuli.

354
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,120
Yuli.

355
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,240
Yuli.
