1
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,400
Welcome, Your Majesty.

2
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,759
You and I...

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
need to

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
as soon as possible.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,320
Yes, Your Highness.

6
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,800
I know that once the Internal Dan comes back,

7
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,640
we

8
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
need each other anymore.

9
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,680
I want to finish what I started.

10
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,760
After all,

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,720
He's a demon. He's a demon. He's a demon. He's a demon. He's a demon. He's a demon.

12
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,320
He is human.

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,600
We have different paths.

14
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
I've already made up my mind.

15
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
After the gentleman meeting,

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
we'll leave here.

17
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,720
and go back

18
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,160
our own world.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,240
Shrimp.

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,320
Shrimp

21
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,200
Young master.

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
What is it, Young Master?

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:55,880
Annoying.

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,040
Open the window.

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Young Master.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,160
The spring night is cold.

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Don't open the window.

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,600
Is something bothering you?

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
Tell me what's on your mind.

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Just tell me.

31
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,320
If you keep it in your heart,

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,560
you'll get sick.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,200
It's inappropriate.

34
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
Stop talking. Just sit.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,200
Tell me.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
I treat that demon well?

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes.

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:24,880
What?

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
Did you quarrel with Lin?

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,120
I just

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,200
from my mother's yard.

42
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,480
I heard Lin said she was leaving.

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,120
Why is this demon

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
so heartless?

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
You're so easily forgetful.

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Before that,

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
the time we spent together

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,520
is nothing.

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,920
She's the most vicious woman.

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,800
Tell me.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Since she came here,

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,000
do I still

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,520
a young master?

54
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,440
No.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,240
It’s kind of…

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
Since she came to the Cheng family,

57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
I listened to her.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,280
She doesn't look like a young master at all.

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,400
How could a fairy

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
by a fairy?

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,920
According to what you said,

62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
it’s a good thing

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
is a good thing.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,720
What's good about it?

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
I thought it would be easier

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,960
to talk to you.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,640
The more I talk, the more irritated I am.

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,400
Young Master.

69
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,720
I don't know if I should say this.

70
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,800
Go ahead.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,520
Are you that one?

72
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,720
Well...

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,120
Which one?

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,360
That one.

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,520
I'm excited.

76
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,640
No.

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
Look at you.

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
You can't sleep at night.

79
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,280
It's the opposite.

80
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
That's not love.

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,240
Then what is it?

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,800
I...

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
to a fairy.

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,480
How is that possible?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,680
No way.

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,159
Did I really

87
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,320
fall in love with a fairy?

88
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,040
No, no.

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm a human and she's a demon.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,600
How could I

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,680
like a fairy?

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
If I'm not human,

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,600
can I

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
like this fairy?

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,560
No.

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
Why should I

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
because of this?

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
Ao Qi.

99
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,640
Eldest Young Master.

100
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Eldest Young Master.

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,840
Eldest Young Master.

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,000
Why are you still lying down?

103
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,400
The carriage is ready.

104
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,080
If you don't get up,

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,320
it'll be too late to go to the academy.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Why is it so hot?

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,680
This...

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,520
Eldest Young Master, don't scare me.

109
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,680
Xie.

110
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,080
Call the doctor now.

111
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,280
Okay.

112
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,520
Hurry, call the doctor.

113
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
Eldest Young Master has a fever.

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Bad news!

115
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,880
Eldest Young Master has a fever.

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,120
Hurry up.

117
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,680
Hurry.

118
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,000
Miss Lin.

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,840
What happened?

120
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,160
I don't know.

121
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,000
He was fine last night.

122
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,720
I had a fever this morning.

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
Why is it so hot?

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,680
Mr. Xu.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
What's wrong, Brother Cheng?

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,640
It's all my fault.

127
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,799
I didn't look well last night.

128
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,480
He caught a cold.

129
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,559
You caught a cold?

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,559
Let me see.

131
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,960
Cheng is protected by the Internal Dan.

132
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
He can’t be so weak.

133
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,600
Is it because

134
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,360
he gave me half of the Internal Dan?

135
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
Let's talk in private.

136
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
We all know that the Internal Dan

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,720
that we can't retrieve for the time being.

138
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,280
Cheng Qi seems

139
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,440
about the Internal Dan.

140
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,600
So I went to

141
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,960
to help.

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
This master once

143
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
met once.

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
She gave us an idea.

145
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,800
It's half for each person.

146
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,760
Half for each.

147
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,680
She said

148
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,040
that half of Cheng Qi's Internal Dan

149
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,440
his life won't be in danger.

150
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
As long as he exercises often,

151
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,200
he can

152
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
live like a normal person.

153
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,000
And the Internal Dan in my body

154
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,040
can cultivate

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,720
through cultivation.

156
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
is just a matter of time.

157
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Ridiculous.

158
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
Where did this master come from?

159
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
You don’t believe me? I’ll believe him.

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
His name is Yuli.

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,280
Last time,

162
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,120
when we caught

163
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,880
who killed Zhang Wanwan,

164
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,880
she happened to pass by

165
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,640
and helped us.

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,520
If it weren't for her,

167
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,280
Cheng Qi and I

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
will die.

169
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,880
What a fool.

170
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,680
Do you think

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,520
helping each other

172
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
It's for each other's sake.

173
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,800
You think too simply.

174
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,400
You're harming each other.

175
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,680
What?

176
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,280
Yuli cast a spell

177
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,040
on the Internal Dan.

178
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Help him up.

179
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,000
Come.

180
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,800
Young Master.

181
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,400
Water.

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,120
No.

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:10,920
This...

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
Why did he faint again?

185
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,640
Is he okay?

186
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,720
He's waking up for now.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,920
He's not stable yet.

188
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Keep an eye on him.

189
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,760
Don't leave him.

190
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,080
Qi.

191
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,160
Qi.

192
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,600
Qi.

193
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,920
What's wrong with you?

194
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,560
What happened?

195
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,320
Qi.

196
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,800
Doctor, check him.

197
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,000
How is he?

198
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,080
His pulse is very weak.

199
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
It's unstable.

200
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,520
What should we do?

201
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,080
Since everyone is fine,

202
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,280
don't wait here.

203
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,720
I'll prescribe a prescription.

204
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,040
Let Eldest Young Master drink it first.

205
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,080
Have a good rest.

206
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,640
Leave one here to serve.

207
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,200
will do.

208
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,280
The rest

209
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
please wait outside.

210
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Madam.

211
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,760
Let me stay

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,520
and protect Young Master.

213
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,040
You're not feeling well.

214
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,160
Go back and rest early.

215
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,360
If anything happens,

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,560
I will

217
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,480
to inform you immediately.

218
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,400
Okay.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,320
I trust you.

220
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you.

221
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
You're too kind.

222
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,160
Xie.

223
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
Follow the doctor to get the medicine.

224
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,320
OK.

225
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,640
Miss Lin.

226
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,600
I’m at the door.

227
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,000
Call me if you need anything.

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,080
Thank you.

229
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,920
Thank you.

230
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,680
Don't worry.

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,760
Lin.

232
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm here.

233
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,840
Lin.

234
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,440
Don't go.

235
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,800
Don't go.

236
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,880
I'm not leaving.

237
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm always here.

238
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm always here.

239
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,600
Come out.

240
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,000
Come out!

241
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,800
I knew you'd come to me.

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,480
It's been a long time.

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,080
Why are you so angry

244
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,400
when you came?

245
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
Did I offend you again?

246
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,600
Tell me.

247
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,160
What have you done

248
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
to them?

249
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
If you want to know,

250
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
then break my formation first.

251
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,400
before we talk.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,520
Their lives

253
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
are now under my control.

254
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,480
I advise you not to waste your energy.

255
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
I thought my mother

256
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,680
to make up for your mistake,

257
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,440
to make up for your mistake.

258
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
It can make you regret.

259
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,280
But now it seems

260
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,800
you don't

261
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
any remorse.

262
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,680
Don't talk about me about my mother.

263
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,240
After all,

264
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,480
she's willing to do it.

265
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,760
Since young,

266
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
ever loved me?

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,840
If she hadn't sent you the letter,

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,240
I would have succeeded long ago.

269
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,800
You're confusing right and wrong.

270
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,760
I don't want to waste time talking to you.

271
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,960
Give me the Internal Dan and Finger Blood.

272
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,240
Otherwise,

273
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,320
don't blame me for not considering our brotherhood.

274
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,080
Brotherhood?

275
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,640
These four words

276
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,960
from you.

277
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,760
That's ridiculous.

278
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
When did you tell me

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
brotherhood?

280
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,440
In the end, you protected her instead of me.

281
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,200
You'd rather push me to a dead end.

282
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,120
and let me kneel down and beg you.

283
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,960
[You won't hesitate]

284
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
without hesitation.

285
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,760
Is this your brotherhood?

286
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
Fortunately, nightmare protected me.

287
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,880
We chose to live and die together.

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,800
Otherwise,

289
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,800
I would have been sealed

290
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,720
in the Soul Suppressing Hall.

291
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,600
Am I right?

292
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,680
Stop!

293
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,800
Why did you let

294
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,800
The Heavenly Kingdom is suffering from nightmares.

295
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,680
Take him back.

296
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,640
Yes.

297
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,000
Brother.

298
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,400
Don't kill me.

299
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,040
Do you know

300
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,720
you're breaking the heavenly rules.

301
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,119
Brother.

302
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,880
Are you really going to kill your sister?

303
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,680
Yuli.

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I can save you.

305
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,160
Save me.

306
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,080
Stop your nonsense.

307
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,720
Yuli.

308
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
I advise you to stop

309
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,920
to be stubborn.

310
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,040
and repent.

311
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,080
The fairy realm might let you

312
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,880
spare your life.

313
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
The fairy realm?

314
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
Will the fairy realm spare me?

315
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,400
Everyone wants me

316
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,680
die earlier

317
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,440
to get rid of a monster like me.

318
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,080
I don't care about the fairy realm.

319
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,280
but the person I love.

320
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,080
For him,

321
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,240
I can meet God and God.

322
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,920
and kill demons.

323
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,520
Yuli.

324
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,760
This is just

325
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,960
your willfulness.

326
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
Mother and I love you.

327
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,880
Stop your

328
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,920
your petty love.

329
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,360
Stop pretending to be merciful.

330
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,480
Yuli.

331
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,240
Turn around.

332
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,240
No need.
