1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm really tired.

2
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
But my feet hurt.

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,560
Come on Joo Jeong-yeon

4
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,519
Come down

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,280
I...

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,520
I can't walk.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, I can't carry it anymore.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,880
Look.

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,520
This is not a place to rest.

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
Hang in there.

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,080
It's going to rain soon.

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,880
We need to find a place

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,640
to avoid the rain.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,680
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,280
Here.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,640
Come on.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,200
Hang in there.

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
I'll help you

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,640
so that you can win the first place.

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Slow down.

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,000
Here.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,040
Be careful.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
It's raining so heavily.

24
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
I don't know when it will stop.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,400
I guess

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,600
When we stop,

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,920
our game is over.

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,200
So what?

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
This competition

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,640
is so annoying.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
How could you say that?

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,560
Have you forgotten

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
why we came here.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,720
This is only the first stage.

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,840
You want to give up?

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
Don't you think it's strange?

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
Normally,

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,920
we should have

39
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,000
the luminous pearl back.

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,000
That's because...

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
If it weren't for me,

43
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,480
you would have

44
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,720
found the luminous pearl.

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,240
Jing Yan, don't worry.

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
We won't leave you behind.

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
Thank you, Lin.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,280
In the past,

49
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,760
I only knew that Cheng Qi didn't like me.

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,800
But I didn't expect him to hate me so much.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,880
Don’t listen to him.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
Sorry, Lin.

53
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,000
It was my fault.

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
I didn't expect you not only didn't blame me,

55
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,160
but also so nice to me.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
Help me.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,480
Let bygones be bygones.

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Let's forget about the past.

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
It's just a passing cloud.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Let's shake hands and make peace.

61
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,920
The luminous pearl.

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
Why are you looking at me?

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,840
I did what you said.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
What else do you want me to do?

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,320
What's wrong?

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,160
The luminous pearl.

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,320
We found it.

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,280
Luminous Pearl.

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Take this luminous pearl

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Take it.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,400
Thank you.

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,960
You found the luminous pearl.

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,200
It should be yours.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
If it weren't for you,

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
I would have been eliminated long ago.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
This luminous pearl

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,960
belongs to you.

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
We are a team.

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,440
Even if we're on the same team,

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,600
No.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,760
Mr. Chen said

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,560
there can only be one winner in the first team.

83
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,600
So you should take it.

84
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,520
This...

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,000
Maybe

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
it's not what he said.

87
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,360
Don't worry.

88
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,760
A gentleman

89
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't know how to set up

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
such a cruel competition.

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,560
Lin,

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
I feel much better

93
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
I feel much better.

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,880
My feet don't hurt that much anymore.

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,320
I can walk on my own.

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,400
Really?

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,160
Are you sure?

98
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,080
Don't worry.

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
If we leave now,

100
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,000
if we leave now.

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,200
Here.

102
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,080
Slow down.

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,080
Why are you pulling me?

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,400
The luminous pearl?

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,880
What about him?

106
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Leave him alone.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
Get the luminous pearl first.

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,880
Okay.

109
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,560
Let's go.

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,040
The luminous pearl.

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,640
Let's go.

112
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,040
Help!

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,240
Help!

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,760
Help!

115
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,200
Brother Hongli, here.

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Help!

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
Help!

118
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
Help!

119
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Help!

120
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
Brother Hongli, save us!

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,200
Brother Hongli, hurry!

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,200
Catch him!

123
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,960
Calm down.

124
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Hurry up.

125
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,720
Grab this.

126
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,600
Come on.

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,480
Okay.

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:18,880
Come on.

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,520
Hold tight.

130
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,760
Come on.

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,560
Hold me.

132
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,920
Have some water.

133
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,920
Thank you.

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,640
Thank you.

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,920
Why did you jump down just now?

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Brother Hongli.

137
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,560
We apologized to you.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
We found the luminous pearl

140
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,760
we became greedy.

141
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,920
I jumped down to get it.

142
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,760
I didn't expect it to be a swamp.

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
in a swamp.

144
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,240
If you hadn't saved us in time,

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,240
we would have died again.

146
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,880
Yes.

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,560
Brother Hongli,

148
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,200
You saved us twice.

149
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
To show my gratitude,

150
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,600
I'll give you the luminous pearl.

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
You found the luminous pearl.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,640
I can't take it.

153
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
This luminous pearl should belong to

154
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,480
the bravest

155
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,600
and wisest.

156
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,159
We don't deserve each other.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,120
Give it to him.

158
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Yes.

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,520
My brother is right.

160
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,640
Our family has been scholars for generations.

161
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,760
were all scholars.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,080
and so on.

163
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,560
Senior scholars, right?

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes.

165
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,800
So

166
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
we have to be virtuous.

167
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,760
We can't embarrass our ancestors, right?

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,280
Yes.

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,120
So we can't

170
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,480
this luminous pearl.

171
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Just take it.

172
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,000
Take it.

173
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,520
I can't take this.

174
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
Brother Hongli, take it.

175
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,160
We don't deserve it.

176
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,760
Just take it.

177
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,880
Gosh.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
We've decided.

179
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,720
to quit the competition.

180
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,640
Seriously?

181
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
Brother Hongli,

182
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,560
life is more important.

183
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,640
Why isn't he back yet?

184
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,800
Yes.

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,360
Don't worry.

187
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
They will come back.

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Are you in danger?

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
Yes.

190
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,360
What happened?

191
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,200
Trust them.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,840
I trust them.

193
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,600
Should we go find them?

194
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,680
Should we look for them?

195
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,200
Yes.

196
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Look.

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,040
Cheng Qi and the others are back.

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,560
They're back.

199
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,400
Cheng Qi and the others are back.

200
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,000
Come on.

201
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,960
It's good that you're back.

202
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,840
Come on! Come on! Come on!

203
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:45,920
Great!

204
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay.

205
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
Come on, Cheng Qi.

206
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,200
OK.

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,480
Good job, Cheng Qi.

208
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,800
It's good that you're back safely.

209
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
Good job.

210
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,640
Come on. OK.

211
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,240
Come on.

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,960
I knew he'd come back.

213
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,720
Yeah.

214
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,280
Congratulations.

215
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,120
You all made it back to the field.

216
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,200
Now,

217
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,280
Students who have the luminous pearl

218
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
step forward.

219
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,960
Why are they together?

220
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,640
Yeah.

221
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,240
They went up together.

222
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,760
Yes.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,520
What does this mean?

224
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,720
Together.

225
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,200
They did it together.

226
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,840
Let me tell you.

227
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
I knew they could do it.

228
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,120
Do all three of them have it?

229
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,800
What's going on?

230
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,160
Who

231
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
who got the luminous pearl?

232
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,440
Okay.

233
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,280
Cheng Qi.

234
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,560
You've passed.

235
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,200
No.

236
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
This luminous pearl

237
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,840
this luminous pearl alone.

238
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,680
The three of us

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
together.

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,680
So

241
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
we can't decide the winner.

242
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,520
This...

243
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,240
That's the rule.

244
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,320
There can only be one rule.

245
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,920
Yes.

246
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,360
It can only be one person.

247
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,760
Yes.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,840
Good teamwork.

249
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,000
So,

250
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,920
the three of you will advance together.

251
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,400
Together.

252
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,080
This is unfair.

253
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,880
This is so unfair.

254
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,520
Yeah.

255
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
How is it unfair?

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
That's the rule.

257
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
It's not fair. It's good.

258
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,880
It's unfair.

259
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,800
It's not fair.

260
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,640
Why?

261
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,320
How is it unfair?

262
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,680
Be quiet.

263
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,040
You think it's unfair, right?

264
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,000
Actually, you are wrong.

265
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,320
This round

266
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
is a test

267
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
your ability.

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,280
But actually,

269
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,400
it's a test

270
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
whether you are united.

271
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,800
Since we are in the same group,

272
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,920
we should work together

273
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
and overcome difficulties together.

274
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,920
And you

275
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,640
all give up your teammates

276
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,600
They abandoned their teammates.

277
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,360
Okay.

278
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,960
You're right.

279
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,520
Great.

280
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,000
Great!

281
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,200
That's great.

282
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,440
Everyone, please

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,520
please find the next round

284
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,440
before tomorrow noon.

285
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,960
If you can't find it,

286
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
they will be eliminated automatically.

287
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
It's getting late.

288
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,960
Everyone,

289
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,120
please go back to the camp and rest.

290
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,480
Please.

291
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,640
This...

292
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,840
I have to find the next level by myself.

293
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,600
That's it?

294
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,680
gave us a Marble.

295
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,120
Where can we find the clues?

296
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,160
We have

297
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,720
quit the game.

298
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,080
We can go back and rest.

299
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,080
Miss Zhou, how's your leg?

300
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Li Ning Yuan.

301
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,360
What's up?

302
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,760
Nothing.

303
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,520
I didn't expect you to advance.

304
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,280
So I specially

305
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,240
to congratulate Miss Zhou.

306
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,400
No need.

307
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,880
In that case,

308
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,720
Mr. Li, please rest early.

309
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,240
The competition is tomorrow.

310
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,360
I think Cheng Qi

311
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
is protecting you.

312
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,160
I guess

313
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
you've gained a lot of trust.

314
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
It’s none of your business.

315
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
Miss Zhou, don’t forget

316
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,480
we are on the same side.

317
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,920
Besides,

318
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,400
what you did before.

319
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,080
I haven't

320
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,160
tell anyone yet.

321
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,880
Lee Yeongwon.

322
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,440
What do you mean?

323
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,480
Don’t worry, Miss Zhou.

324
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,320
I don’t mean anything else.

325
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,200
I just want you

326
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,960
in the next round,

327
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,440
in the next round.

328
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
to stall Cheng Qi and others.

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,440
so that they can't advance.

330
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
Why should I help you?

331
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,960
Why?

332
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Because I know

333
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,840
what you did

334
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,080
you did.

335
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,480
Cheers.

336
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,520
Congratulations on

337
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,800
you made it today.

338
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,040
I was just lucky.

339
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,640
Lin.

340
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,400
Are you really

341
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
take her with you?

342
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
What if

343
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,600
disqualified?

344
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,160
This is too risky.

345
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

346
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,720
Although Joo Jeong-yeon

347
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
is a little willful,

348
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,280
but she's still a weak woman.

349
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,080
Think about it.

350
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
At such a critical moment,

351
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,440
how can we ignore

352
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,480
classmates?

353
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,560
A gentleman should be generous

354
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,520
and loyal.

355
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,840
Only those

356
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,080
who do everything

357
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,160
will kill each other.

358
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,560
This time, a gentleman

359
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,600
set such a rule.

360
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,880
It clearly led

361
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,040
between students.

362
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
only those who are pure

363
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,480
without being manipulated by profit

364
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,880
can truly be called a gentleman.

365
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,640
Hong Li.

366
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm quite confused.

367
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,720
How did you get the Luminous Pearl

368
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,760
get the luminous pearl?

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm good at nothing.

370
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,800
I was just lucky.

371
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,640
What do you mean by that?

372
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,520
Do you really think it's that simple?

373
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,960
Stinky carp, you're too modest.

374
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,200
Why didn't you tell me

375
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,000
you saved those two brothers

376
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,960
in danger.

377
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
they are grateful to you

378
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,480
so they gave it to you.

379
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,160
Just...

380
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,360
Just so so.

381
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,840
I didn't expect

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,320
to be so benevolent.

383
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,040
He's a gentleman.

384
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,760
Here's to you.

385
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,640
Let's do it together.

386
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Wish you a victory!

387
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,360
Return to victory!

388
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
Here, eat it.

389
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,960
Help yourself.

390
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,640
You have important tasks.

391
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,040
What about me?

392
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,400
I also have a mission.

393
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,720
I have a competition tomorrow.

394
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,640
You...

395
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,200
This is for you.

396
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,640
Why?

397
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,800
They are all chicken legs.

398
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
Why am I chicken feet?

399
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,800
No, I'll eat it.

400
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,640
Fine, chicken feet are meat too.

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,520
Joo Jeong-yeon.

402
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,520
What brings you here?

403
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,400
Jung-yeon.

404
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,480
Would you like to sit down

405
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,280
and eat with us?

406
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,280
No need.

407
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,720
I came to you

408
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,400
to tell you something.

409
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,960
You eat first. I’ll be right back.

410
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,080
Wanwan, are you full?

411
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,680
Yes.

412
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,440
Then I'll eat this.

413
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,920
Okay, leave some for me.

414
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,680
Cheng Lin.

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
I’m here to tell you

416
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I’ve decided to quit.

417
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,760
Withdraw?

418
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,360
Why?

419
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,360
Didn't Mr. Chen agree

420
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,560
to promote us together?

421
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
I can't

422
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,599
I can't help you.

423
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,079
I’ll drag you down.

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,359
Cheng Lin.

425
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,359
Thank you for being so tolerant to me.

426
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,359
for treating me like a friend.

427
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,440
Don't say that.

428
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,200
We are

429
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,319
are friends.

430
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,400
You really don't have to quit.

431
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,119
If you have any difficulties,

432
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
we can overcome it together.

433
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
Actually, when I first joined the competition,

434
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,000
I wanted to

435
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,359
to compete with you.

436
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
I have always admired Mr. Cheng.

437
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
You know that.

438
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
But after what happened,

439
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
I finally realized

440
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,680
you are the real

441
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,760
a match made in heaven.

442
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
You like each other

443
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,040
and treat each other sincerely.

444
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,000
Your relationship is indestructible.

445
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,560
As others,

446
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,080
I can see it.

447
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,600
I envy this kind of relationship.

448
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
So I figured it out.

449
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,600
Instead of making more mistakes,

450
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,040
I'd rather quit.

451
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,720
In that case,

452
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,800
I don't have to attend

453
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,920
to attend the gentleman's meeting.

454
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,240
But I got

455
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,920
that is more precious

456
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,560
is friends.

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,040
By the way,

458
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,760
You have to be wary of Lee Ning-won tomorrow.

459
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,240
Lee Yeongwon.

460
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:48,680
Special Producer.
