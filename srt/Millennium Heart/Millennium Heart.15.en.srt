00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,800
What are you doing today

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,440
I don't know.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,560
It looks so colorful.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,680
Beautiful.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,280
What is this?

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,200
There are words.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,280
A cow.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,840
What does this mean?

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,080
A lantern riddle.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,360
It's also called lighting riddle.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,200
This requires participants.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,360
According to the meaning of this riddle,

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,200
based on the meaning of this riddle.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,400
and finally figured out the answer.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Don't underestimate

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
This little puzzle

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
Because the riddle covers everything.

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,760
For example, there are riddles and idioms.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,840
There are humanities and birds and beasts.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,640
There's no riddle

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,600
there is no riddle that can't be solved.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,600
There are many ways

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,400
in different ways.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,960
Anyway, it's a test for people.

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,960
comprehensive IQ.

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:00,960
I'll read it.

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,840
What does this mean?

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
This is easy.

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,239
A cow.

30
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,319
It's "life".

31
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Succulent meat, you've made great progress.

33
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,720
Of course.

34
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,640
It's so lively today.

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,000
Everyone is here.

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,360
Since you are so interested

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,680
this lantern riddle,

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,320
Why don't we compete?

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,360
What?

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
Are you afraid

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,160
Are you afraid to compete?

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,039
Who are you referring to?

43
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,360
It's just a riddle.

44
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,240
I’m not afraid.

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,960
Cheng Lin is not good at studying.

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
but she’s smart.

47
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,600
How do you want to compete?

48
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,560
This is the first time

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,720
to hear him praise me like that.

50
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,680
But...

51
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,080
if Li

52
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,720
compared to Cheng Lin alone,

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
isn’t it a bit too much?

54
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,560
I got it.

55
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,520
I got it.

56
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,640
In that case,

57
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,479
let's be formal.

58
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,560
Men and women team

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,840
each team.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,240
I’ll team up with Miss Zhou.

61
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Cheng Lin can also

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
with any male student here.

63
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,120
What do you think?

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,160
If you don’t mind,

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
I’ll team up with Cheng Lin.

66
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
What do you think?

67
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,640
He wants to team up with Cheng Lin?

68
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,720
What?

69
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,400
Are you afraid?

70
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,440
Why should I be afraid?

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,640
Sure.

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,640
Okay.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,480
Since everyone

74
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,600
are ready,

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
Let me introduce

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,600
the rules of the game.

77
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,440
There are six riddles in total.

78
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,600
Li Ningyuan and Zhou Jingyan are a team.

79
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,079
Cheng Qi and Cheng Lin are a team.

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,040
According to

81
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,400
the total score

82
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,800
to calculate the total result.

83
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,360
and choose the winning team.

84
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,960
The game starts now.

00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
Perfect.

95
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,320

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,880
Hurry up and guess.

97
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320

Yeah

103
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,160
Why one?

104
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Did you guess it?

105
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,720
Amazing.

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
It's really fast.

107
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,079
It's one.

108
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,000

Half empty

Half empty

114
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,000
It's Jiang.

115
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,400
The word "Jiang" in the ocean of Jianghu.

116
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,320
Jiang?

117
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,000

They're really good.

126
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,200
What should we do now?

127
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,400
Help me.

128
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
You don't study when I tell you to.

129
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,440
How can I help you now?

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,440
At least

131
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,680
make yourself proud.

132
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,240
Forget it if you don't help me.

133
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,160
I'll do it myself.

134
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,240
The third question.

135
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Please listen to the question.

136
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Someone is inside.

137
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,160
There's someone inside.

138
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:06,880
Meat

139
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,920
Meat. Meat.

140
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,040
That's right It's me

141
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm succulent.

142
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,520
That’s right.

143
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
Correct. Cheng Lin scored one point.

144
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Awesome.

145
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,360
Really amazing.

146
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
Cheng Lin is good.

147
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,200
Awesome.

148
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,360
It seems Cheng Lin is quite smart.

149
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,320
Next question.

150
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,400
Question 4 is an idiom question.

151
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,520
Please look at the question.

152
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,800
Three, three, five, five, five.

153
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Three, three, five, five.

154
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Three plus three equals

155
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
It shouldn't be that simple.

156
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,520
There's a crowd.

157
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,159
Correct.

158
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,240
One more point for Cheng Lin.

159
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,520
It’s really crowded.

160
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,200
Yeah.

161
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,120
Cheng Lin is amazing.

162
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,840
I didn’t expect that.

163
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,760
There are two more questions.

164
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,200
This is also an idiom question.

165
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,680
Next question.

166
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,600
Deep.

167
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
Staring.

168
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,480
That's it?

169
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
That's it.

170
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,760
How do I guess this?

171
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,480
That's it?

172
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,880
Yeah.

173
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,960
How do I guess this word?

174
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,560
Could it be that

175
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,280
This word

176
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
There's a black and a word.

177
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,560
This riddle has sound and color.

178
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,040
and colourful.

179
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
What does it have to do with gloom?

180
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
What does it mean? Just one word.

181
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,760
How do I guess this?

182
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,760
Correct.

183
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
Cheng Qi scored one point.

184
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,520
It's beautiful.

185
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,000
Awesome.

186
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
Awesome. Indeed.

187
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,040
Black and sound.

188
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Amazing

189
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,120
Left half right half

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,040

191
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
Wake up the dreamer in one word.

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
Yes.

193
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,520
The last question.

194
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,560
The last question.

195
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,680
Confucius climbing.

196
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,400
Confucius climbing. Confucius climbing.

197
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,280
Confucius climbing.

198
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,400
I know this question.

199
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,360
It's Yue.

200
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Yue.

201
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Yue.

202
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,480
Why Yue?

203
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,640
Correct.

204
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Lee Yeongwon got one point.

205
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,520
That's the word.

206
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,080
I know.

207
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,960
How did you guess it?

208
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,680
Amazing.

209
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,240
They're even now.

210
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,920
Yes.

211
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Let's see what Hongli says.

212
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,760
We have to try one more question.

213
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,440
It's a tie, right?

214
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,040
How does it count?

215
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
Three to three.

216
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,720
Extra game.

217
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,400
Sir is here.

218
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Everyone is here.

219
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,880
It's quite lively.

220
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
Hello, sir.

221
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,080
Just now,

222
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
just now.

223
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,480
Everyone,

224
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
You answered very well.

225
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,400
In that case,

226
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,160
let me test one more question.

227
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,720
to test you.

228
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,360
Mr. Yu knows everything.

229
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,400
He's well-informed and well-informed.

230
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
and understand people's harmony.

231
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,760
It must be you

232
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
to decide the winner.

233
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,280
Ningyuan.

234
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,240
Your father was my disciple.

235
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,800
Now,

236
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
don't embarrass him.

237
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,280
Yes.

238
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,960
Okay.

239
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll make it harder.

240
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
Listen up, everyone.

241
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,520
Put some fragile flowers on it.

242
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,920
We meet again after we parted last night

243
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,080
unify Wu Shi Li in Jiangdong.

244
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,960
In the afternoon,

245
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,920
This...

246
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Are you reciting a poem?

247
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,400
How could it be a poem?

248
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,560
The seven words need to be fixed.

249
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
with strict rhymes.

250
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Pyongyang is more important.

251
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,800
This question is too difficult.

252
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,880
I really can't guess it.

253
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,360
Yeah.

254
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
I couldn't figure it out.

255
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,159
The answer is...

256
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,240
The dragon and phoenix look auspicious.

257
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
The dragon and the phoenix bring good luck.

258
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Good.

259
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,280
What an auspicious performance.

260
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,000
Great!

261
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Amazing

262
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,240
Amazing!

263
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
Amazing. Great.

264
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
Cheng Qi is amazing.

265
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,640
Yes.

266
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,600
Amazing.

267
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,159
Cheng Qi.

268
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,920
You've passed

269
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
the wisdom exam.

270
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,880
You can represent the academy

271
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,280
on behalf of the academy.

272
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,000
Awesome, Cheng Qi.

273
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Thank you, sir.

274
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,400
Great!

275
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,440
Great.

276
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,440
Amazing.

277
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,320
Amazing.

278
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,120
Great!

279
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,240
He should go.

280
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,280
The rest of you don't have to be discouraged.

281
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
We will have

282
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,560
several rounds of games.

283
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
Those who want to participate

284
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
must keep working hard

285
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,520
and get good results.

286
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
Today is a gentleman's meeting.

287
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,600
the representative selection of martial arts.

288
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
Everyone, stop it.

289
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,760
Don't hurt your classmates.

290
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,880
Now I announce

291
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
the game begins.

292
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,280
Okay.

293
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Here we go.

294
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,799
I've been looking forward to it.

295
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay.

296
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,840
Amazing.

297
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Great.

298
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
That's amazing.

299
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah.

300
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,120
Thank you.

301
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,880
This is amazing.

302
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,720
Clear.

303
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,600
That was a great scene.

304
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,640
I didn't expect that.

305
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,720
This...

306
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,720
What's wrong with Lee Yeongwon?

307
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,440
Is he crazy?

308
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
If you want to be strong,

309
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
and defeat the enemy,

310
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,480
be cruel enough.

311
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't give each other any chance.

312
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,400
Who else?

313
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
What's the big deal?

314
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,520
That's right.

315
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,880
So arrogant.

316
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Another one.

317
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,280
This is too cruel.

318
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,720
What does he mean?

319
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,360
What's going on?

320
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,280
This is too much.

321
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,160
How can you do this?

322
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,760
The winner is so cruel.

323
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,680
What?

324
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,600
That's too much.

325
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,360
Who else?

326
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,840
Let's go together.

327
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,360
I told you.

328
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,480
not to hurt anyone.

329
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,320
So what?

330
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,680
I won.

331
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,280
I won.

332
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
Who else?

333
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,240
What happened

334
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,160
Li Ning Yuan today?

335
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,280
Even if we win in the past,

336
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,040
he wouldn't hurt people maliciously.

337
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,040
Exactly.

338
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm afraid he...

339
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,320
by him.

340
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes.

341
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,640
I've never seen him

342
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,400
so fierce.

343
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,400
He had no grudge with the judge.

344
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,440
Why did he do that?

345
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
Lee Yeongwon is so funny.

346
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,880
He has dark circles under his eyes.

347
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,080
It's like you're not sleeping.

348
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,160
You're still so energetic.

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
It's not fair to win.

350
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,360
What's there to be proud of?

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah.

352
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,360
Why are you so proud?

353
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,880
Li,

354
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,640
Let's play a game sometime.

355
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,280
Jung-yeon.

356
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,680
You're so beautiful today

357
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,600
Jung-yeon will make it today.

358
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,960
the beauty care selection

359
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,880
in this selection.

360
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,880
The peach pink hawk

361
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,800
is so beautiful.

362
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,320
Yes, look at the fabric.

363
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,240
The silk is good, right?

364
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,360
Lin,

365
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,240
Your silk is so beautiful.

366
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,800
Do you want to join

367
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,960
for beauty care?

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,480
I haven't decided yet.

369
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,520
But I think

370
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,640
if you participate,

371
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,520
you will win.

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,320
Is Cheng Lin going to audition too?

373
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,760
Watch here.

374
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
I'll meet her.

375
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:14,880
Miao'er.

376
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,120
It's so beautiful.

377
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,040
Look at this.

378
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,600
It's still shining.

379
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,440
Tan Miaoyer, what are you doing?

380
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,320
I didn't see you, Cheng Lin.

381
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,160
I’m so sorry.

382
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,520
Cheng Lin.

383
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,160
Wait.

384
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,000
you are going to audition too?

385
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,600
Cheng Lin.

386
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,360
How do I look?

387
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,440
Nice.

388
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,960
Zhang Wanwan.

389
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,520
Am I seeing it right?

390
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,200
Are you and Cheng Lin

391
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,520
both of you

392
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,040
the beauty selection.

393
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,480
Tan Miaoyer.

394
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,280
You stepped on my silk.

395
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
I won't say anything.

396
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
What do you mean?

397
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,640
Others don't know

398
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,400
what kind of person you are.

399
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,440
what kind of person you are.

400
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,760
Tan Miao'er.

401
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,720
I advise you

402
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
stop bullying others.

403
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080
Zhang Wanwan.

404
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
How dare you talk to me like that?

405
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,080
What did I say?

406
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm telling the truth.

407
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,840
Zhang Wanwan.

408
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,000
Have you forgotten

409
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
about yourself?

410
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
No one wanted to date you before.

411
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,840
Jeong-yeon and I were kind-hearted.

412
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm willing to date you

413
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,480
and become friends with you.

414
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,120
Jeong-yeon and I were so good to you,

415
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,840
but you are so ungrateful.

416
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,280
Is it because you have a new master

417
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,480
who has voted for you,

418
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,280
How dare you be so disrespectful to me?

419
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Don't say that.

420
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
You're the villain who complained first.

421
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,760
You're blaming me.

422
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,640
I have a problem.

423
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,840
But I'm not as hypocritical as you.

424
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,160
You always say

425
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
how nice you were to me.

426
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,080
I think

427
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:43,920
just to

428
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,720
to use me.

429
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,800
The things you did before.

430
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,840
Do you think I have the nerve

431
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,560
to tell others?

432
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,400
You...

433
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,320
Lin, Zhang Wanwan and Tan Miaoyer.

434
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,040
What are you talking about?

435
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,800
Tan Miaoyer looks so angry.

436
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
Shall we take a look?

437
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,160
Don't worry.

438
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,920
Just let them

439
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
Just let them handle it themselves.

440
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,080
That’s right.

441
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
I am willing to be friends with Cheng Lin.

442
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,840
Because being friends with her

443
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,680
is much better than

444
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,080
than being friends with hypocrites like you.

445
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,560
You did give me a lot of benefits,

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,520
but you never showed me respect.

447
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
But Cheng Lin is different.

448
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,200
She is not as hypocritical as you.

449
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,080
Besides,

450
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,760
she treats me sincerely.

451
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,680
In this way,

452
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
You understand?

453
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,560
You...

454
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,840
All right.

455
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,320
Stop arguing.

456
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
After all, we are classmates.

457
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,240
Don't hurt our harmony.

458
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,880
I think Miao'er

459
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,480
she didn't mean it.

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,920
Since we're going to

461
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,640
the selection,

462
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
Let's get ready.

463
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:38,960
Wonderful.

464
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,560
Wait.

465
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Tan Miao'er.

466
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
You stained my silk.

467
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,280
Shouldn't you apologize?

468
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,000
What kind of apology is that?

470
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm not the only one

471
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
you offended just now.

472
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,720
and Wanwan.

473
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,200
You have to

474
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,280
this apology seriously.

475
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
Zhang Wanwan, I’m sorry.

476
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,720
It was my fault.

477
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,720
I apologized.

478
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,200
What about the silk?

479
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,200
Why don't you use mine?

480
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I'm just afraid

481
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,120
this color.

482
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,880
Forget it.

483
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,040
This color

484
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,080
is my least favorite.

485
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,520
Keep it for yourself.

486
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,280
Wanwan.

487
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,040
What's wrong?

488
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,840
Are you okay?

489
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,000
I...

490
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,320
I never dare

491
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,520
talk to them like that.

492
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
If you weren't here today,

493
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,440
seeing you so brave,

494
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,400
I dare not

495
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
tell them that.

496
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,319
Don't worry.

497
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm here.

498
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,079
I won't let anyone bully you.

499
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,200
You...

500
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,920
be careful of them.

501
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,160
Don't worry.

502
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,319
They

503
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,839
can't do anything to me.

504
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,599
Let's go.

505
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,720
Let's get ready.

506
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,960
I was so angry just now.

507
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,160
Cheng Lin went too far.

508
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,240
Jing Yan.

509
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,560
I don’t understand.

510
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,800
Why did you let her go

511
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Why did you let her win?

512
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
Have you forgotten

513
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,800
Have you forgotten?

514
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,440
Yes.

515
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,800
How could I forget?

516
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,080
But to expose her,

517
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,960
I need to wait for a chance.

518
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,320
Before that,

519
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,160
I can't let her suspect me.

520
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,240
Instead,

521
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,360
take me lightly.

522
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,560
That way,

523
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,200
I can kill her.
