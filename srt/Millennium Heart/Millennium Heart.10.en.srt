1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,920
She's here. She's here. She's here.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,960
with Joo Jeong-yeon and the others?

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,160
Why are they so close?

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,600
Jing Yan Zhou was pouring tea for me.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,520
Zhang Wanwan

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,600
She's playing the piano with me.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,320
What's wrong?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,840
Am I bothering you?

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,720
Of course.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,120
What's bothering you?

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,160
What?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,600
Tell me.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,440
What did I do to you?

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,040
You're in my way.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm in your way.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:56,960
Yes.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,720
The fruit you just threw

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,600
must be sour.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,440
What do you mean?

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,039
Who is jealous?

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm not jealous.

22
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,560
You...

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,759
What are you doing?

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,479
Let go!

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
Let go of me!

26
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,080
Let go of me!

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,960
What do you want?

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,880
I...

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,120
I want to ask you

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,960
the dress?

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Clothes.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
What clothes?

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,920
It's a wedding dress for praying.

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,079
Well...

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,600
It's just my usual clothes.

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,040
What a joke.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,840
How can it be

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,840
ordinary clothes?

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,880
Of course it should be dressed in auspicious clothes.

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,240
Dress up?

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
I've sent someone to prepare it.

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Do I need

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
prepare?

44
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,240
You still need to prepare?

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
My brain.

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
My brain.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,800
Do you smell it?

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,960
It smells so good.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,560
It smells so good.

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,079
They seem different.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,680
Yes.

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
She's even prettier.

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,640
It smells good.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,200
Yeah

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,280
How come? It smells so good.

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,240
I think

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
prettier than yesterday.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,840
Yes.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,760
What's that smell?

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,200
It smells good.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,840
Yes.

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,600
It's from them.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,640
I want to be

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,920
as beautiful as them.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,680
Me too.

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,400
This smell.

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
They are so beautiful.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
They appeared in my dream.

69
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,760
Yes.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,079
So beautiful.

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,040
It smells so good.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,800
It smells good.

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,240
So beautiful.

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,040
So beautiful.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Please.

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Eldest Young Master, take a look.

77
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,240
This is the new product of this year.

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,520
There are snowflakes white.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,480
Unwilling to be red.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,480
Rouge.

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,320
Three Blue.

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
Which one do you like?

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,120
I like that one.

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,040
That blue one.

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,640
is not red or white.

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,800
Take the rest away.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay.

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,320
Take away the white snowflakes.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,040
Okay.

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,320
You have good taste.

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
It's top quality if you don't want to be popular.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,120
It's really

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
luxurious things.

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Later, on the auspicious dress,

95
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,600
on the wedding dress.

96
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,040
Then the wedding shoes

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,200
with silk.

98
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Remember to make it the same.

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Okay.

100
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
Yes, Young Master.

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,280
100 taels in total.

102
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,120
How much?

103
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,280
100 taels.

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
Send someone to pick it up.

105
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay, Young Master.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Take care, Eldest Young Master.

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
It's just a red dress.

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,320
Isn't it a bit expensive?

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
You won't understand.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
It's a waste.

111
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,920
Outside,

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
you are my cousin.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
you represent the Cheng family.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,960
At the praying ceremony,

115
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,240
I can't let you wear

116
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,560
so casual?

117
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
that would be

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,720
disgrace my family.

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,560
Not only that,

120
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,720
you had to

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,480
with the best accessories

122
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,880
and get on the top carriage.

123
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,400
So troublesome.

124
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,320
If you don't want to go,

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,480
Of course not.

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,880
Think about it.

127
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Cheng Qi

128
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,280
so generous to me.

129
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,120
Do you like me?

130
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,520
Of course.

131
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,000
These things

132
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,440
for nothing.

133
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
You need to pay a price.

134
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,920
A price?

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,840
What price?

136
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
Let me tell you.

137
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,840
I'm not someone

138
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
who can be manipulated by money.

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,400
who can be manipulated by money.

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,159
No.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,680
You think too much.

142
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
Even if you are willing,

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
I won't.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
You just need to

145
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,120
practice with me every day.

146
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,720
Practice?

147
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,760
Smells good.

148
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,720
Shrimp

149
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,520
It smells like

150
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,280
from here.

151
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,360
Succulent meat.

152
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,640
Do you know these characters?

153
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,760
Xiang Cui Pavilion?

154
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
Do you know

155
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,440
what they sell?

156
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,800
Flower cake.

157
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,320
It smells good.

158
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,520
This is the smell.

159
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,880
See?

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
It's the rouge. It's the smell. It's the smell. It's the smell.

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,400
Then why does it smell

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,280
smell like flower cakes?

163
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
Take your time to think about your flower cake.

164
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,240
Shrimp.

165
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,120
Shrimp

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,159
Succulent meat.

167
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Lin.

168
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
Why are you here?

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,560
I was wandering around with Shrimp.

170
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,480
I smelled

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,760
a very good smell.

172
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,880
I made a bet with him.

173
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,480
I knew it was flower cake.

174
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,720
He insisted it was rouge.

175
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
So we followed the taste

176
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,480
to this place.

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
Where is Shrimp?

178
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,520
He said it smells very good.

179
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,320
so he went in.

180
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,800
It does smell good.

181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,280
Let's go in and have a look.

182
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,160
I smell the best.

183
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,680
It smells so good.

184
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,679
It smells so good here.

185
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,120
What?

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,679
This smell

187
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,559
I feel dizzy.

188
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Shrimp let's go

189
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,000
Shrimp

190
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,280
This feeling

191
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,640
This smell...

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,640
What's wrong?

193
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,840
Are you sick?

194
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,840
Don't you think it's strange?

195
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,640
Strange?

196
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,800
I don't know.

197
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,600
This place is really weird.

198
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,000
There must be something wrong with the things here.

199
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,120
Let's go.

200
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,400
Something's wrong.

201
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,040
I didn't notice.

202
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,920
Isn't this

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
ordinary rouge fragrance?

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,800
Wake up, Shrimp.

205
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,400
Shrimp

206
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,200
Young Master.

207
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,120
Why are you here?

208
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,320
Who hit me just now?

209
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Did you see it?

210
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,720
No.

211
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Why did you come out?

212
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
What did you see inside?

213
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,960
Something is wrong.

214
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,880
Something is wrong.

215
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,400
What's the problem?

216
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,360
Smoke.

217
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
A strong smoke.

218
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,840
Smoke?

219
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,480
I didn't see any smoke.

220
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,920
Lin, did you see it?

221
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,080
There is smoke inside.

222
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
But this smoke is not a demon aura.

223
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Could it be...

224
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
this smell?

225
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,760
Could Zhang Wanwan be

226
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,960
by this smell?

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Weird.

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where are the people on the street?

229
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
What's going on?

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Could the three of them

231
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,680
were bewitched by this smell?

232
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Let’s go and have a look.

233
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,160
Are you Master Yuli?

234
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,600
Can you

235
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
for me?

236
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,880
How can I trust you?

237
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
Master Yuli.

238
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm convinced.

239
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,440
I offended you just now.

240
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,800
I'm willing to be your master.

241
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
I'll be at your disposal.

242
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,680
Sister Liu bought a new bracelet.

243
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,280
So beautiful.

244
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,800
Did you see it?

245
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,640
I saw it.

246
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,480
That blue one.

247
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Where did the stray cat come from?

248
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,040
Peeing here?

249
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
This is the good place you chose.

250
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,560
Stare at a place you can see.

251
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,240
where you can see.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
You are

253
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,360
in the world.

254
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,240
No one dares to bully you anymore.

255
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:06,920
Yes.

256
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,680
No more.

257
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,320
You've been staring for two hours.

258
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,760
Did you see anything?

259
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,680
No.

260
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,680
Master Cheng,

261
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,680
I think we should forget it today.

262
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,720
Let's investigate again tomorrow.

263
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,400
Just wait.

264
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,680
I have a feeling.

265
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,480
she'll reveal her weakness soon.

266
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,880
I have a feeling too.

267
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,720
Zhang Wanwan

268
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,920
is going to sleep soon.

269
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,240
But I can take a look.

270
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,560
When did you become so interested

271
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,040
in catching demons?

272
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,640
Ever since I met you two,

273
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,360
with you two,

274
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,160
I've read a lot of

275
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,160
about catching demons.

276
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,200
But it says

277
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,640
we must be patient to catch demons.

278
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,720
and wait for them to expose themselves.

279
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,600
There must be something wrong with Zhang Wanwan.

280
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,520
She has been sitting

281
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,680
for two hours.

282
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,280
The dressing table.

283
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,360
What dresser?

284
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,600
We can't see it here.

285
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,160
The dressing table.

286
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
There's something wrong with our location.

287
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,360
Let's go.

288
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,560
It's her.

289
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,560
What smells so bad?

290
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
Is that demon still here?

291
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I just...

292
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,920
just now.

293
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,720
Is this the smell of a demon?

294
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know.

295
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,240
But it smells

296
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,160
something is wrong.

297
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,520
Fox stink.

298
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,040
Definitely.

299
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,400
I swear.

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
it has nothing to do with me this time.

301
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,560
This...

302
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,839
This...

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,839
This is the same pattern

304
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,079
of the Beast.

305
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,960
No wonder

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,319
the demon aura was so strong.

307
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,319
This is not an ordinary demon.

308
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,160
can create.

309
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Looks like it's not that simple.

310
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
You mean

311
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,440
there's something behind this?

312
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,200
It's possible.

313
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
Since the situation is so complicated,

314
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,280
where did Zhang Wanwan

315
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,520
Zhang Wanwan?

316
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Hong Li went to the gambling house.

317
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,880
Zhang Wanwan is...

318
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,080
Xiang Cui Pavilion.

319
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,840
I don't know

320
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,880
whether you're a human or a demon.

321
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,800
Go to sleep first.

322
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,600
This.

323
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,520
What is this?

324
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,480
I'm a demon. I don't need it.

325
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:26,960
Here.

326
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,240
I don't need it either.

327
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,040
Open.

328
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,840
Succulent meat.

329
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,040
You stay outside.

330
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,680
Don't let anyone in.

331
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
Don't worry. No one can come in.
