1
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,800
You lose.

2
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,080
I won't give you the thing.

3
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,120
Kill me if you want.

4
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,080
How I wish

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,720
go back to our childhood.

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,760
My Lord.

7
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,840
Jun Xu came to see you.

8
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,320
For me,

9
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,400
for me.

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,759
I'm fine.

11
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,600
I'm glad I didn't let you down.

12
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
Jun Xu.

13
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
How could you...

14
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,720
No way.

15
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
You were the one

16
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
entered my illusion.

17
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,760
In fact,

18
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,320
I've noticed it long ago.

19
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,320
The eye of the illusion.

20
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,200
I switched the entrance to the hallucination.

21
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,320
So...

22
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,400
it wasn't me.

23
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,560
entered your illusion.

24
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,840
but you entered my

25
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,840
So,

26
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,160
everything you did just now

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
just to set me up.

28
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,760
Including what you said, right?

29
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,320
Jun Xu.

30
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,160
I underestimated you.

31
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,400
I wanted to believe you.

32
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,080
Yuli.

33
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,080
What I said just now

34
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
from the bottom of my heart.

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,360
I did this

36
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
to save Cheng Qi.

37
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,960
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

38
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
Ao Qi.

39
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
Ao Qi.

40
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,840
Are you telling the truth?

41
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,120
Cheng Qi is dying.

42
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
It's true.

43
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,080
Congratulations, Young Master.

44
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank God!

45
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,160
Thank God!

46
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,360
Go.

47
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,520
Keep an eye on him.

48
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
about Cheng Qi.

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,960
Young master, I want to

50
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
to Cheng Qi's funeral.

51
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes.

52
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
The ephemeral ghost.

53
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,880
Even if I don't do it myself,

54
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
God has his own plan.

55
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
Are you dreaming again?

56
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,440
Ao Qi.

57
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,400
What kind of dream is she dreaming about?

58
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,720
Why does she cry

59
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,840
every time?

60
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,520
Sister.

61
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
Are you a fairy?

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,440
You're an immortal, right?

63
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,920
Can you cure my heart disease?

64
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,840
Please, please.

65
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay.

66
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
I promise you.

67
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,360
But you have to wait for me.

68
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,120
You have to go far

69
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,600
to collect the Deity Herb.

70
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,960
You must come back.

71
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
Miss Fairy,

72
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
I'll wait for you.

73
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,560
It's her.

74
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,640
At first,

75
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,000
I hated you.

76
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,880
Pride and domineering.

77
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
He always wears a long face.

78
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,200
and always

79
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,440
full of vigor.

80
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,880
He likes ordering me around.

81
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
But

82
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,120
after getting along with you,

83
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,720
I felt

84
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
you are not as bad

85
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
as bad as I thought.

86
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
You're actually quite nice.

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
and nice to me.

88
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,320
and succulent meat.

89
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,800
I didn't expect

90
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,960
Now

91
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,200
I kind of like you.

92
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,520
Really.

93
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,240
You...

94
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,440
You...

95
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,720
When did you wake up?

96
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
Just now.

97
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
When you said you like me,

98
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,080
you eavesdropped on me.

99
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,840
I'm not

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,840
eavesdropping on you?

101
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,520
I just

102
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
just heard it.

103
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't care.

104
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,800
Don't get me wrong.

105
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
I mean...

106
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,200
Say it.

107
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,760
I don't hate you that much.

108
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,520
Understood.

109
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
It failed.

110
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,360
Useless.

112
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
Although I can't

113
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
control Ao Qi now,

114
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
But I can still control Wan Mo.

115
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,120
They must...

116
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,320
We don't have much time.

117
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
I understand.

118
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I will never let you lose again.

119
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Remember,

120
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
Don't be soft-hearted again.

121
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,920
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,040
I've regained my power.

123
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm waiting for you.

124
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,880
Ao Qi.

125
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
Ni Mo.

126
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,480
Who are you?

127
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
Why are you here?

128
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,960
What?

129
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,200
Are you lost?

130
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,040
This is a forbidden place in the fairy realm.

131
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
How did you get in?

132
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,680
I'll take you out.

133
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
Don't bother.

134
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
Just tell me

135
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
how to get out here.

136
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
I can walk by myself.

137
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,840
Such a beautiful hand.

138
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,680
Why did you hide it?

139
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,880
What’s your name?

140
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,880
My name is Yuli.

141
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,240
Yuli.

142
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,600
I’ll take you out now.

143
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,200
My Lord.

144
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,960
I hope one day

145
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,920
you will understand my love for you.

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,400
Jun Xu.

147
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,840
Why is your body

148
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,680
so badly?

149
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,280
It's okay.

150
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:54,920
How are you?

151
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,880
Are you feeling better?

152
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,720
I didn't expect

153
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,920
to recover so fast.

154
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,720
It's just that the yang energy is still weak.

155
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,400
I told you before

156
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,840
the consequences of extracting the Internal Dan by force.

157
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,840
Why are you still so stubborn?

158
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
Your improvement today

159
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,280
is only temporary.

160
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,480
Take this pill

161
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,760
in case you need it.

162
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,760
From today onwards,

163
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,760
you have to practice with Lin every day.

164
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,440
Only by adding your energy

165
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,440
your energy

166
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,520
so that you won't be in danger.

167
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,240
Wait.

168
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,920
What do you mean?

169
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,120
What do you mean?

170
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,240
Cheng Qi.

171
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,480
Didn't you say

172
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,760
you would be fine.

173
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,960
Say something.

174
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,040
You lied to me.

175
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,040
Why didn't you tell me the truth

176
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,760
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

177
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,000
Lin.

178
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,240
Lin.

179
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,359
Don't worry.

180
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,240
She won't leave.

181
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,480
Leave her alone.
