1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,200
Thank you, Huang.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,760
It’s my pleasure.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,560
Mr. Cheng knows

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,800
Master Cheng knows it too.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,760
You should know

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,880
how many years

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,280
in front of my room?

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,720
Master Yuli has killed him.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,600
Now that I think about it,

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,200
I didn't expect

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,120
to have a new branch recently.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,360
As for Qi'er,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,840
for Qi'er.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
Madam Qi

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,880
This is

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,240
I told you before.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,000
We have heard about you.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,600
Now that we see withered trees sprouting,

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
It's unbelievable.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,840
Master.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
You know each other?

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Mr. Cheng is kind.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,360
Mr. Cheng and I

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,800
once.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,480
Yes.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,480
Qi is indeed kind.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,720
That's even better.

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,920
Since Young Master and Master Yuli

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,240
Master Yuli,

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm sure it's not wrong.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,840
You are right.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,039
Do you like it?

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,400
So pretty.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
When I see you,

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
when I was young.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,200
when I was young.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,480
When Qi was half a year old,

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
the doctor told me

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
this child has congenital heart disease.

40
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,880
He may not live past five years old.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,600
I cry every day.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,720
His smile

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
has also decreased.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760
and further isolated from me.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,600
I often thought

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
if Qi'er can recover,

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
I can do anything

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,840
for him.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,520
If I can help him,

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm willing to do it.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
Amitabha.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,840
Master.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Please save Qi.

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,720
Miss,

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
You've been kneeling here for three days.

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Your sincerity...

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
Buddha knows.

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
I can't do anything

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,520
I can do nothing.

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,920
It's getting cold.

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
Go back.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,440
Amitabha.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,680
Master.

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,080
Master!

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Master!

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Master.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,720
Mother.

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,360
Stop crying.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll be with you.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,480
Maybe my love for my son

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
and Qi'er's persistence

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
touched the heavens.

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Qi finally survived five years old.

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,120
But at that time,

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,760
Master took in a concubine

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,440
and Di'er.

77
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,200
Look at me.

78
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Why did I tell you

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,520
about my past.

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,960
as my daughter.

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,400
Tomorrow is your prayer day.

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,280
You should be happy.

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,440
As long as you say it,

84
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,920
as long as you tell me.

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
Look at this girl.

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,520
She's smart and sensible.

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
I really like it.

88
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Thank you, Madam.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,480
Now,

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
I finally met Master Yuli.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
Qi can be cured.

92
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,080
I can finally rest assured.

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,960
Master Yuli,

94
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Are we the same?

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,600
Yes, they all look the same.

96
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,520
It's nothing.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,560
It's my duty.

98
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,520
You're welcome.

99
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,400
Sorry for the trouble.

100
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Hurry up.

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,640
So beautiful.

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,159
Lin is so pretty.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
Is this Cheng Lin?

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
wearing a praying robe.

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
It must be Cheng Lin.

107
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,880
She is so beautiful.

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,240
Yes.

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
What's there to see

110
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
Jeong-yeon looks much better

111
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
Much better than this

112
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,040
But I heard

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,400
Mr. Cheng

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
for Cheng Lin.

115
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,920
So good.

116
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,560
It's really pretty.

117
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,360
We have to work hard next year.

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll wear

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,960
like a fairy.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,680
You look pretty in it too.

121
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,920
You're a woman.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,400
Why are you so strong?

123
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,680
Sure.

124
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,120
Next time I fly,

125
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,040
when I fly next time.

126
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,159
That's unnecessary.

127
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,800
Mr. Xu, Mr. Gu.

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,159
What do you think

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
How about Lin's outfit?

130
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,160
It looks good.

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,520
Thank you, sir.

132
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,640
All right.

133
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,760
Students,

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,920
It's getting late.

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
Let's go up the mountain.

136
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes.

137
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,160
Okay.

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,760
Here.

139
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,360
Wanwan.

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,040
Are you okay?

141
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,720
If anything happens,

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,680
just tell me.

143
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,640
I'll help you.

144
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,440
Thank you.

145
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,760
Let's go up the mountain.

146
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,720
Let's go.

147
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Let's go.

148
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,760
The purple air comes from the east.

149
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,160
The earth is like a jade.

150
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,200
Glorious land

151
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,920
Flowers bloom together.

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,800
The sun, moon and stars

153
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,400
Blessings all over the world

154
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
May you be blessed.

155
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,760
Good luck will come.

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,960
I pray for the deities of four seasons

157
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,080
a new year in Lincheng.

158
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,880
in the city.

159
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,880
Peace and peace.

160
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Look at your food.

161
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,800
I dropped my clothes.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
I didn't expect the vegetarian food to be delicious.

163
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,400
It's delicious.

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm starving

165
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,400
Eat more vegetables if you're hungry.

166
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,360
Try this

167
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,160
This looks good.

168
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,760
Let me try yours.

169
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,640
No, no more.

170
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,840
Wanwan.

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,240
There is a seat here.

172
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
I wonder

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
can make a wish.

174
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I can't wait.

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,960
I want one.

176
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,680
Me too.

177
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,440
Thank you.

178
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
Lower your voice.

179
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,720
Don't let others hear you.

180
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
I'll think you're ignorant.

181
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,360
You can only fly the lantern

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
after eating.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,560
By then,

184
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,880
you can write your wish

185
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,040
on the lantern.

186
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,640
It must be magnificent then.

187
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
Our academy must be bored

188
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
because our study is boring.

189
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,880
That's why he arranged so many

190
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,560
extracurricular activities.

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,560
Interesting.

192
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,920
Next,

193
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
the annual gentleman meeting

194
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,000
That's the real big scene.

195
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,240
A gentleman...

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,440
What is that?

197
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,480
A gentleman's meeting

198
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
is the biggest event

199
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
in every academy.

200
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,640
And a gentleman will decide

201
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,800
of each academy.

202
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,400
Before the gentleman's meeting,

203
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,400
every academy

204
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,640
will have internal selection.

205
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,360
Only those selected

206
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,160
can represent the academy.

207
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,080
So you mean

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,680
many academies will attend?

209
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,680
It must be lively.

210
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,600
Yes.

211
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,800
Only three or four schools

212
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
are qualified to attend the gentlemen's meeting.

213
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,680
The winner of the last competition

214
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,920
is the best scholar

215
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,480
This year,

216
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,400
on behalf of

217
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
on behalf of our academy.

218
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,440
You participate?

219
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,280
What are you going to compete for?

220
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,360
Tie a kite.

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,360
or play tricks?

222
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,640
You...

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
I can fight.

224
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,320
right?

225
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,920
At worst,

226
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
I can break boulders in my chest.

227
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,280
Right?

228
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Yes.

229
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,280
Zhang Wanwan

230
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
on purpose.

231
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,560
For our sake,

232
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,560
for the sake of us,

233
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,800
if you can’t get any benefits.

234
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,480
Maybe

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
Zhang Wanwan was bewitched

236
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,560
by Cheng Lin.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
I always think

238
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,080
Cheng Lin doesn’t look like

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,120
Cheng Qi's cousin.

240
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,400
Jing Yan.

241
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,560
You think so too?

242
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,880
I wanted to tell you long ago.

243
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,040
Besides,

244
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
he doesn't look like a human.

245
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,680
Brother, come after me.

246
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Slow down.

247
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,480
Be careful.

248
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,440
Come on

249
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:45,960
Sister.

250
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,920
Sister, what's wrong?

251
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Are you okay?

252
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,000
Look.

253
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Sister, does it still hurt?

254
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,000
No.

255
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,760
Be careful.

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,480
Brother.

257
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,880
I beg you.

258
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,600
Please save me.

259
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,680
Please do it. I beg you.

260
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,760
Please do it. I beg you.

261
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,720
Yuli.

262
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,280
Yuli.

263
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,720
Brother.

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,560
Yuli finally...

265
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,080
Release.

266
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm free.

267
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Yuli,

268
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,720
When will you come to your senses?

269
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Jun Xu.

270
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
You summoned me here

271
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,280
Have you figured it out?

272
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,160
It's been a thousand years.

273
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,840
Why?

274
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,120
Why?

275
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,720
Just because of the illusion?

276
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,560
Do you know

277
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,240
You're committing a sin.

278
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,600
Brother.

279
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,520
Now,

280
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,480
I'll call you brother.

281
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,320
If one day,

282
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,640
we become enemies again,

283
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
I won't scream anymore.

284
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
If you summoned me here today

285
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,119
just to question me,

286
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,560
I can leave.

287
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,160
Do I have to

288
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
to be your enemy now?

289
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,160
Do you remember my mother?

290
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,000
Mother.

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,079
Do you still remember me?

292
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,599
If you remember,

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,120
you wouldn't be so unfilial.

294
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,760
What?

295
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,080
You want to kill me now?

296
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,600
Do you remember

297
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,880
I'm your sister?

298
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,760
From now on,

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,440
you are not my sister anymore.

300
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,280
No wonder.

301
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,000
You've always been cruel to me.

302
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,360
7OPWORKS

303
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,360
Sheng Ga He

304
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,280
Here you go. Here you go.
