1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,680
It's time.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,280
All scholars, please

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,680
please enter.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,160
The first one to show up is Beicheng Academy.

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,600
OK.

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,440
The second one is Zhengjun Academy.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,920
Okay.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,800
The last one to show up is Lincheng Academy.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,880
Okay.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,480
Okay.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Everyone,

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,520
are all talents in Lincheng City.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
and carry the spirit of the city.

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,920
the great responsibility

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,800
to make Lin City prosper.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
This time,

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,440
is to select the best talent.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,039
and make him famous.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,320
The title of the top student

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,920
and become

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,440
of other talents in Lin City.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,360
So please

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,680
show your real skills

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,800
Fight with all your might.

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,640
Show us your highest level.

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,360
Let's see

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,200
the spirit of the disciples of Lin City.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,800
Okay.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,440
Next, please

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,600
to shake.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,160
All students disrupt the order

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
and shake the number of the same color.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,479
into a group.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,720
The odds are higher.

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
If you're unlucky,

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
it depends on luck.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,920
Yeah, it depends on luck.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,560
Yeah.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,560
It's hard to say.

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,120
Thank you.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm blue.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
I want blue too.

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,800
I want to team up with you.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,600
But the probability is small.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't worry.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm always lucky.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,840
I was in a hurry.

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:38,960
Not yet.

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,760
Soon.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,720
Here, here.

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,200
Coming.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,000
What a coincidence.

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,480
You are a group now.

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:53,880
Yes.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,440
Yes.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,320
I'm blue.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,840
You're lucky, right?

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,920
We're on the same team.

59
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,440
Good luck.

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,160
Okay.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,880
Okay.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
I’ll take this later.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Master, Lin.

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm yellow.

65
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,840
I want to be your group too.

66
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
I don't know

67
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,720
who I'm with.

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm so nervous.

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,880
It's okay.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
I don't know anything.

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
At worst, there's always a way.

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,520
We'll cover it up.

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,320
Don't worry.

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,400
Come on.

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,120
Come on.

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,160
Who is yellow?

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,960
This way, please.

78
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,720
We are

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,200
are in the same group with you.

80
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,760
Yes.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,200
The yellow one.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,760
This man

83
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,920
You're very strong.

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,480
Then we have a big chance to win.

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,040
Yeah.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,800
Nice to meet you

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,480
Hello Hello

88
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,840
Nice to meet you

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,520
What's your name?

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,520
What's your name, bro?

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
Hongli.

92
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
That's a good name.

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,080
Hello, Li. Hello.

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,800
Hello.

95
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
The grouping is over.

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,680
Students,

97
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
please press the scarf in your hand.

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,920
Line up in the same color.

99
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,360
Now

100
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,600
the first round.

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,399
All 15 of you

102
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,120
will be divided into five groups

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
into five groups.

104
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,920
In the backpack

105
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,480
on both sides.

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
in the backpack

107
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,240
for this assessment.

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,159
Now,

109
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,280
the evaluation begins.

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
You three form a group

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
and enter the forest together.

112
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
In the depths of the forest,

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,600
in the depths of the forest.

114
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,360
the luminous pearl in advance.

115
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,159
Within four hours,

116
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
in two hours

117
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
and return to the drill ground

118
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
will pass the test successfully.

119
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,600
Remember.

120
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,920
Among the three,

121
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Only the last one

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,200
the students who hold the luminous pearl

123
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,560
can advance.

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Two left.

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
will be eliminated.

126
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,040
No, no.

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,400
I can't walk anymore.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
Let's

129
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,440
Let's take a break here.

130
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Aren't you tired

131
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Aren't you tired?

132
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,159
I'm fine.

133
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
There's no water source nearby.

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,400
Neither do we.

135
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
to find it.

136
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,200
Hurry up and rest.

137
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Have some water.

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,400
Are you tired?

139
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm done.

140
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,800
Let's go.

141
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,159
You're classmates from the North City.

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,240
Why are you here

143
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,640
why are you here?

144
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,440
The rules of this round

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,280
the number of students is limited.

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,760
The number of luminous pearl

147
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,000
is limited.

148
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Since Beicheng Academy

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,720
Since we want to win honor,

150
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,000
we can't increase the amount of the luminous pearl.

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,800
Then we have to

152
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,280
the number of competitors.

153
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Don't worry.

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,280
We won't hurt

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,080
your lives.

156
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Run!

157
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,200
Mr. Cheng.

158
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,160
Sorry.

159
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,800
We offended you.

160
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,680
Since we work together,

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,240
let's share happiness

162
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,640
Let’s share weal and woe.

163
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,720
Mr. Cheng.

164
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,120
It’s inappropriate, Mr. Cheng.

165
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
Mr. Cheng, it’s too tight.

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,520
From now on,

167
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,080
the three of you

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,120
share weal and woe together.

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Live and die together.

170
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
We'll share weal and woe.

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
We'll share weal and woe.

172
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Where is Zhou Jing Yeon?

173
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,400
Wasn't she

174
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,840
with you just now?

175
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,400
I just shouted, "Run!"

176
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,600
She disappeared.

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,560
You said you were tired.

178
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,560
Why are you running so fast?

179
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
Help!

180
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,520
Go.

181
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,200
Mr. Cheng.

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,160
Mr. Cheng, let us go.

183
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,640
Don’t go.

184
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,360
Brother.

185
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
Why are you walking so fast?

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
If there's a trap ahead,

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
he can help us

188
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,560
for us.

189
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,560
He's not

190
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,640
from the same school.

191
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,680
When he walked in front,

192
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
If he finds the luminous pearl in advance,

193
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,880
our efforts

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,880
all our efforts will be in vain?

195
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,240
That's true.

196
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,320
Brother look

197
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
What's hanging on this tree?

198
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,400
Is it a luminous pearl?

199
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,640
Why are you still here?

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Hongli.

201
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,040
We

202
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,680
want to take a shower.

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Yes.

204
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Give me a hand.

205
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,960
You go first.

206
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,480
I need to pee. I'll be right back.

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,320
Twins are so interesting

208
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,560
Do we have to go to the toilet together?

209
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,480
He's gone far. Move.

210
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,400
Did you get it?

211
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
Yes.

212
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Help me!

213
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,640
Don't be nervous. I'll save you now.

214
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,120
Don't be nervous. Help me.

215
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,560
Hurry.

216
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Swim over here

217
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
Swim this way

218
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
Take a longer stick.

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Let me think of a way.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,280
Brother!

221
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,080
Hurry!

222
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,640
Grab my stick.

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,760
Hold on tight.

224
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,000
Help!

225
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,320
Help!

226
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Help!

227
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,360
Help!

228
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,200
Help!

229
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,840
Help!

230
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,360
Hold tight.

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Help!

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Is anyone there?

233
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,640
Help!

234
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,880
Is anyone there?

235
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Cheng Qi.

236
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,440
What happened?

237
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,200
I fell down.

238
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,800
My foot hurts.

239
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,320
Let me see.

240
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,800
Be gentle.

241
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
You're badly injured.

242
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Do you still have water?

243
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:34,920
I do.

244
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
This is the only water left.

245
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
It hurts.

246
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,480
Why does my foot hurt so much?

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
You're swollen.

248
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,240
Of course it hurts.

249
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,520
You sprained your ankle.

250
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,440
If you don't treat it,

251
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
you won't be able to recover soon.

252
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,360
I have some painkillers.

253
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,960
It can relieve your pain temporarily.

254
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,840
Trust me.

255
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,640
How are you?

256
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,040
Feeling better?

257
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
Thank you, Lin.

258
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,240
It's okay.

259
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,520
We are classmates.

260
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,960
She can't leave like this.

261
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,680
What should I do?

262
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm fine.

263
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,440
I can walk.

264
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,280
Don't act tough.

265
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
Your leg is injured.

266
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
If you can't leave,

267
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,840
we can carry you.

268
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,160
What?

269
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,760
Are you going to carry her?

270
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,080
Of course.

271
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Otherwise, in the middle of nowhere,

272
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,960
It's dangerous for her

273
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,800
is dangerous.

274
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
You're a weak girl.

275
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,680
carry her on your back?

276
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,320
It's so far.

277
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,840
I didn't say I'll carry you.

278
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,520
Who will carry it then?

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,440
You.

280
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,320
I...

281
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,560
I won't.

282
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,920
Cheng Qi.

283
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,360
Let me finish.

284
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,560
I won't.

285
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:09,920
I am...

286
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm your husband.

287
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,200
I won't carry other women.

288
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,840
Stop laughing.

289
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Don't be angry.

290
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,080
This is a special situation.

291
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,520
Look.

292
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,840
She's injured.

293
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
She is our classmate

294
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,680
and our teammate.

295
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,360
You can't bear

296
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,720
to see her here alone.

297
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
Don't worry.

298
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,120
I won't be jealous.

299
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,760
or mind.

300
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,760
or angry.

301
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,800
Fine.

302
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,080
For your sake,

303
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,080
for your sake.

304
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,600
Here.

305
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,120
Here.

306
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,120
Slow down.

307
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,280
Mr. Cheng.

308
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,480
It’s not good.

309
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,880
What's wrong with you two

310
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,160
You even peed in the river.

311
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
The rock is too slippery.

312
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,960
Slide?

313
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,520
Can you skate so far?

314
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,120
It's really slippery.

315
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,800
What about you?

316
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
slipped in?

317
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,520
No.

318
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,760
I was dragged in

319
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,720
to save him.

320
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,520
Can you swim?

321
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,320
No.

322
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,440
Go down and save him if you can't swim.

323
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,320
Do you want to die?

324
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
We're brothers. We value friendship.

325
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes, we value friendship.

326
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,560
In my opinion,

327
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,920
since we're in the same team,

328
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,960
it's fate.

329
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Since we are a team,

330
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,560
we should be team.

331
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,840
First, be honest.

332
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,560
Also,

333
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,000
I have a piece of advice.

334
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,480
No matter what you want to do,

335
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,520
life

336
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,400
is the most important.

337
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,360
Master Yuli said

338
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,440
the hidden place of the luminous pearl

339
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
is on this tree.

340
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,880
But why haven't I found it yet?

341
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,240
Let's go.

342
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,160
Stop!

343
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,560
Hey,

344
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,079
Why are you stopping me?

345
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,079
Since you

346
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,240
found the luminous pearl,

347
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,240
Why did you hide it yourself?

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,760
Don't forget

349
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,760
the three of us are a team.

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,839
So what?

351
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,560
The rules are clear.

352
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,319
Three people in a team.

353
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
Only one of them can make it.

354
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,320
Everyone has their own skills.

355
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,840
You're not as good as others.

356
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
you should admit defeat.

357
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,440
Now you want to take it by force.

358
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,560
Senior.

359
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,920
Calm down.

360
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,320
We found the luminous pearl.

361
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,120
Isn't it

362
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
for us.

363
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,320
Right, Ning Yuan?

364
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,880
Ning Yuan,

365
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,720
Although

366
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
from the same academy,

367
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,400
But I knew your name long ago.

368
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,840
I've always admired you.

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,680
I didn't expect

370
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,280
to meet you at the gentleman's meeting.

371
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,440
To be honest,

372
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,480
I think

373
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,480
among the scholars

374
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,880
among all the students,

375
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,840
among all the scholars.

376
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,120
who is good at both literature and martial arts.

377
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,920
is the most likely

378
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,080
the best.

379
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,000
Really?

380
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Yes.

381
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,320
What?

382
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
You don't think so?

383
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,240
I think so too.

384
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,760
Ning Yuan,

385
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,240
You've been looking for the luminous pearl all day.

386
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,360
You must be tired.

387
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,920
Have a good rest.
