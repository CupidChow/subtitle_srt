1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
It's good to have someone to talk to.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,800
I don't want to think too much.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,920
What?

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,720
Are you still upset

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,320
about what happened today.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,520
Although I didn't mean it,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,000
I always feel

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,400
I feel sorry for her.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,800
I know you didn't mean it.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
But they don't think so.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
I still think it's good to be a demon.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
Being a demon?

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,520
It's always me.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,480
I can be happy.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,120
But being a human is different.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,880
You have to be careful with your words and actions.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,920
I think you've improved a lot.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,680
Looks like your books

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,360
are worth reading.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,080
Maybe.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,120
I didn't think like that before.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:15,760
You...

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,160
Why are you staring at me?

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,480
I just think

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
today.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,880
Really?

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,120
What?

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,400
Am I

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
very pretty today, right?

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,880
Yes.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,080
Let me show you something.

32
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,440
Do you know who this is?

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,600
She is the embarrassment of the four beauties.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
Floral Immortal, Lady Yang.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,759
Look at her necklace.

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:52,880
What do you think?

37
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,720
Is it nice?

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,600
Look again.

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,240
Who is this?

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
This is the closing moon of the four beauties.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,160
Diaochan.

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,039
Look at her necklace.

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,720
Her necklace

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,040
is exactly the same as Lady Yang's.

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,960
That's right.

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
You should know this.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,079
This is the sunken fish of the four beauties.

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,840
Beauty.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,280
Look again.

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,960
the necklace she's wearing.

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,440
I know.

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,320
She wore the same one with the first two.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,440
Right.

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,920
So?

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,680
you think

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,640
I don't look good wearing this necklace?

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,960
Or am I not as pretty as them?

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
You're prettier than them.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,840
But

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
this necklace doesn't match you.

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,040
But you gave me this necklace.

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm the first young master of Lincheng City.

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,079
How can I always be controlled

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,200
like you?

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,400
So today,

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,960
a necklace today.

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,440
A necklace that suits you.

69
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,640
You want to give me a necklace?

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes.

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,920
For me?

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,760
Of course.

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,400
Do you have something

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
to ask me?

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
What can I ask you for?

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,840
Then why did you give me the necklace?

77
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
I happened to see this necklace

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
on the street today.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
I think it suits you well.

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
Try it on.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,600
Really

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,560
Really.

83
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:55,960
What do you think?

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Do I look good?

85
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Yes.

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Very nice.

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,200
Then leave this to me too.

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,280
I can wear these two.

89
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,320
This one doesn't match you.

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
And it's old.

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,440
I should have thrown it away long ago.

92
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,480
Why did you throw it away?

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
I bought it with money.

94
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,959
What a pity.

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,200
This necklace doesn't match you.

96
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
is worthless.

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,440
I should have thrown it away long ago.

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,640
You look good in this.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,760
You look better than them.

100
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,520
It's getting late.

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Go back and rest.

102
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,440
Really?

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,760
They're all pretty.

104
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,280
Lady Yang.

105
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,000
Diaochan.

106
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
After applying it,

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,480
it will definitely make you unique.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,480
I'll take a look.

109
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,760
Miss, what would you like?

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,440
Waiter.

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
I want an osmanthus-flavored fragrance powder.

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay.

113
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,760
Smell it.

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,280
Miss,

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,120
We just bought

116
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,120
new lipstick.

117
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,360
It suits you very well.

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,960
Try it.

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm the most beautiful woman in the world.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,000
Who is the most beautiful woman in the world?

121
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,520
Who?

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,280
I am the most beautiful woman

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,400
in the world.

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
Who dares to compete with me?

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,120
I...

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
the most beautiful woman

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,560
in the world.

128
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,280
How is it, Xu?

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
I didn't expect

130
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
to recover so quickly.

131
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,000
So,

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,880
my body

133
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
completely recovered.

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,960
Great.

135
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,120
Thank you, Brother Xu.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,520
In this way,

137
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
my wish

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,520
my years of wish.

139
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,800
I can also make my mother

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,320
rest assured.

141
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,760
I can finally return the Internal Dan

142
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,480
to Lin.

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,320
I'll be free.

144
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,720
What's wrong, Xu?

145
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
Aren't you happy

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,040
for me?

147
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,920
Of course.

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
Then why do you look like that?

149
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,480
You may not

150
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,680
return the Internal Dan to Lin.

151
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,480
What?

152
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,120
No way.

153
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,320
Why?

154
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
The Internal Dan has completely integrated

155
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,520
into your body.

156
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,520
in your body.

157
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
So you mean

158
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,920
the Internal Dan

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
in my body.

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
in my body.

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,480
Don't worry.

162
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,440
Cheng,

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,640
do you trust me?

164
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,280
Of course I do.

165
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,640
Just trust me.

166
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,280
I'll find a way to solve the problem.

167
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,039
But

168
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,919
I need some time.

169
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,039
Xu,

170
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,880
I have another question.

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Go ahead.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
I asked Shrimp

173
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
I asked Shrimp to find a master

174
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,880
to find a master.

175
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,720
Because at that time,

176
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
about Lin.

177
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,080
So I’m afraid

178
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
because of the Internal Dan.

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
so I tried to protect her.

180
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,200
But recently, Lin

181
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
is getting weaker.

182
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
Is it because of this necklace?

183
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,520
No wonder she found you.

184
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,600
What?

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,480
Nothing.

186
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,800
This is...

187
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,800
that sucks blood.

188
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,360
Luckily you found it in time.

189
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
Otherwise, it would be bad for Lin.

190
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,080
Leave this to me.

191
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll take care of it.

192
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
Thank you, Xu.

193
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,280
Hurry up.

194
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,280
Wait for me.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,280
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

196
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,080
Yes.

197
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,760
Sorry.

198
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,880
Sir is here.

199
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,080
Coming.

200
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Hello, sir.

201
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,040
The winner of this year's kite festival

202
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,120
has been chosen.

203
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
I hope all the students

204
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
can keep up the good work.

205
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,160
No matter what the result is,

206
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,920
no matter what the result is.

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,320
The winner of the paper kite festival is

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,480
Hong Li.

209
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,640
Hongli.

210
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,280
Hongli.

211
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,600
Hongli.

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Hongli.

213
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,240
You're the winner.

214
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,560
I...

215
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
Why me?

216
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Thank you, sir.

217
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,920
Okay.

218
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,560
Congratulations.

219
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,280
Miao'er.

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,960
Where is Wanwan?

221
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
Didn’t you say

222
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,160
you bought yesterday?

223
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
I wanted to win the first place

224
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,160
to make a wish.

225
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,680
You're a demon.

226
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
What wish do you have?

227
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,160
Do you want me to marry you?

228
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,320
You are

229
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,640
in yourself.

230
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,200
We fairies

231
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,400
make a wish?

232
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Why are you laughing?

233
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,240
Cheng Lin.

234
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Cheng... Cheng Lin.

235
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,840
Master.

236
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
I need to talk to Lin.

237
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,440
Can we talk in private?

238
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,280
This is for you.

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
You deserve it.

240
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,320
This...

241
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,560
I've

242
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
with Mr. Yu.

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,120
I will give you

244
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
in a few days.

245
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,600
Why?

246
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,320
Your paper mandarin duck.

247
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
If it wasn't broken by accident,

248
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,040
it would have been the best.

249
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,760
By the way,

250
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,720
I have another request.

251
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,120
I want you to help me

252
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,920
ask Zhang Wanwan out.

253
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,200
Ask Zhang Wanwan out?

254
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,360
Well,

255
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,160
I like her.

256
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,600
But I feel embarrassed.

257
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
You like Zhang Wanwan.

258
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,240
Okay.

259
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,040
I'll help you.

260
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,360
Really?

261
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,680
I'll go back and wait for your good news.

262
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,560
Thank you.

263
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
This is love.

264
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,200
I must help him.

265
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,760
You're amazing.

266
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,600
Amazing!

267
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,960
Our dragon is flying!

268
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,320
The dragon is flying.

269
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,760
Mr. Cheng, are you drinking tea?

270
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,560
Miss Zhou.

271
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,600
It’s time to enjoy tea.

272
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
But the flower hall

273
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
in this floral hall.

274
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,040
for our students.

275
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,520
So,

276
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,800
I usually carry it with me.

277
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,920
If you don't mind,

278
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
I would like to invite you

279
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
to taste it with me.

280
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,440
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

281
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
I have something important to do.

282
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,600
I’m leaving.

283
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,200
Mr. Cheng.

284
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,000
The schedule made me

285
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,360
lose face in front of everyone.

286
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,280
I just want to invite you

287
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,040
to enjoy tea and flowers with me.

288
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,920
as compensation.

289
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,120
OK?

290
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,080
Mr. Cheng.

291
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,440
Have some tea.

292
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,520
Thank you.

293
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,520
Mr. Cheng.

294
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,040
Today,

295
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,520
I want to play

296
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
for you.

297
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,280
Young Master, what do you think?

298
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,040
Go back.

299
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,800
Let’s go.

300
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,720
Mr. Cheng, have some tea.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,359
Okay.

302
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,839
You're right.

303
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
The fruit tastes terrible.

304
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,520
Mr. Cheng.

305
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,640
Go after him.

306
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,280
Why don't you go after him?

307
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
Don't you like him?

308
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,320
You should get him if you like him.

309
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,520
Idiot.

310
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,080
Zhang Wanwan.

311
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,200
How could you talk to Jung-yeon like that?

312
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,720
Shut up!

313
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
You have no idea

314
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,920
when I listen to you.

315
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,080
Wanwan.

316
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,560
What’s wrong?

317
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,520
Zhang Wanwan.

318
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,000
What are you doing?

319
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,720
Jung-yeon, are you okay?

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,720
Do you know

321
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,600
Only when you become beautiful

322
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,480
can get

323
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,240
what you want.

324
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm the most beautiful woman

325
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,080
in the world.
