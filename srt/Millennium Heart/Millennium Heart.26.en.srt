1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,080
It's been so long.

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
after so long?

3
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,280
I'm incompetent.

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,960
Please

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,600
give me more time.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,720
The book is an ancient artifact.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,280
It's hard to find it.

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,520
It's not your fault.

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,040
I've sent someone to investigate.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,920
I think there will be

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,800
new news soon.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,840
How is the Phoenix Pill

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
How about the imprisonment place?

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,800
The Phoenix Pill is protecting you.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
is indeed more powerful.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,759
We still have

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
is still in our hands.

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,080
Let's see how they can fight us.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,840
Lin.

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
It's okay, Lin.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
We still have time.

22
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
We don't have time.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
The gentleman meeting is about to begin.

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm so weak now.

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,680
how can I keep the divine memorandum?

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
This is the source of

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,079
in the Heavenly Realm.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Drink it.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,640
Why don't you try it first?

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
Drink this water and you'll have power.

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Anything else? Give me more.

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,440
You can give it to me

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,440
when the gentleman meeting.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
The source

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,280
to produce this bottle in 3,000 years.

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
That's all I have.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,800
I only have one bottle in 3,000 years.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,520
What should we do?

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
I'll think of another way.

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
The most important thing now

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,560
practice hard.

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,760
The spirit assembly formation

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
is useful.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,760
If only the divine memorandum

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
it would be better if it didn't appear so soon.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,000
Keep practicing.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,320
Father.

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,160
I'm done.

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,079
Look.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,480
How is it?

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,280
Master, look.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
Di

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,040
has improved.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,520
Yes.

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
But compared to your brother,

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,040
than your brother.

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,920
Di.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,920
Did you hear me?

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,079
Your father said your handwriting has improved.

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,480
Thank you, Father.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Master.

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
I specially ordered the kitchen

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,079
to make ginseng tea for you.

65
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,040
Do you want to try it?

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,160
Here.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,000
Father.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,400
It's hot.

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,440
Compared to filial piety,

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,160
your brother is not as good as you.

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,200
Di,

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
From now on, you must

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
to your father.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,680
Your father

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,760
for you.

76
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,640
It’s not easy.

77
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,920
The Cheng family

78
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,800
has such a status in Lincheng.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,840
thanks to your father.

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,400
Yes.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
I will listen to you.

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
and learn from you.

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,040
Right.

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,720
It's hot.

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Don't

86
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
like your father.

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't know much.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,720
It's all thanks to the merits left by my ancestors

89
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,760
and the protection of the book.

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,440
Otherwise, I wouldn't have built

91
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
Lincheng Academy.

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,320
Although we are businessmen,

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
there are some things

94
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
understand.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
This luck

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,920
for nothing.

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,280
If you want something, you have to give it first.

98
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,120
If you don't cherish it,

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,680
if you don't cherish it,

100
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
will be gone.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,240
Alright.

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,440
I will listen to you.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,480
Master.

104
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,800
Look.

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
we have a treasure like the book.

106
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,800
and Di'er works so hard.

107
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,200
Can we give him

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,800
to him?

109
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Take a look.

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
Jin'er,

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,360
It's not that I don't want to.

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
This book

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,760
It is said that

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
Unless it chooses someone,

115
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,080
no one can touch it.

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,480
Once you touch it,

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,680
it won't bring good luck,

118
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,000
it'll bring bad luck.

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,000
So I can only keep it.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
I won't touch it.

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,200
You must be joking.

122
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,680
No matter how divine the ancient book is,

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,080
it's just a book.

124
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
I've never heard of it.

125
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
which book can't be read.

126
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
Master must not want to show it to Di.

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Father, be careful.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,320
Jin'er.

129
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,760
It's not that I don't want to show it to Di.

130
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
We can't disobey our ancestral teachings.

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,000
Tell me.

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
The objects left by several generations

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,160
It must be something.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,520
If I break the rule,

135
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,960
I will be punished.

136
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,159
See?

137
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,320
Master is afraid that

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,320
break the rules.

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,760
If we don't announce it,

140
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,760
and we won't use that book to bully us.

141
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
What's retribution?

142
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
Those words

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,440
must be passed down from my ancestors.

144
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,720
to scare children.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
No one has seen any disaster.

146
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
What makes you think so?

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,120
Master.

148
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,400
I know you are worried about Di.

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
For Di'er's sake.

150
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
But Master,

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,240
Have you

152
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,760
I've never seen it in my mansion.

153
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,720
Is he not here?

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
Come in.

155
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,280
Greetings, Father.

156
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
Greetings, Concubine Jin.

157
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
I have something to say to Qi.

158
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
You may leave.

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,600
Yes, Master.

160
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,000
Father.

161
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,960
You asked me to come at this hour.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,760
Is there something?

163
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,800
Sit.

164
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Mother.

165
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,320
Don't talk.

166
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
I've heard

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
a few days ago.

168
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,320
I should have

169
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,520
scold you.

170
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,680
But your mother

171
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
told me

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,240
that you've grown up.

173
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,840
and asked me to wait for two days.

174
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,120
after two days.

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
Zhou Mang came to me these days

176
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
for a long time.

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
What does that mean?

178
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,600
His daughter, Joo Jeong-yeon,

179
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,360
is interested in you.

180
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,520
Father.

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,280
About what happened a few days ago,

182
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,360
was my fault.

183
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
But I was drunk

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,240
when I was drunk.

185
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,360
That's why I treat Miss Zhou

186
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,880
as Lin.

187
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,640
All right.

188
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
No need to explain.

189
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,679
Didn't I tell you?

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,159
Zhou Mang came to discuss with me.

191
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,520
to let his daughter

192
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,720
marry into our family.

193
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,360
What?

194
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
How can I do that?

195
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,520
I already have Lin in my heart.

196
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,240
How is that possible?

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,960
marry his daughter?

198
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,360
In the letter,

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,280
in the letter.

200
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,160
It's just a misunderstanding between us.

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,280
So what?

202
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Although

203
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,600
you've grown up,

204
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,280
But

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,960
there are many things you don't understand.

206
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,840
If we are a match,

207
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,400
the Cheng family

208
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,280
should approve this marriage.

209
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,280
We are merchants.

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,360
But the Zhou family

211
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,480
is an official family.

212
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,640
If you can marry

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,640
the daughter of Minister of Personnel,

214
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,840
is your blessing.

215
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
It’s good for

216
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520
and you.

217
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
will be very beneficial.

218
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,600
If you become an official,

219
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
it won't be easy.

220
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,280
to do?

221
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,600
Father.

222
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,680
I never thought that way.

223
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't want to gain fame

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,920
through marriage.

225
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,120
My relationship with Lin is pure.

226
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
I will never do

227
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,560
make her sad again.

228
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
If you are willing,

229
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,720
I can

230
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,200
can be inherited by you.

231
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
our family's book.

232
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,200
You should know that

233
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,400
Di is the one

234
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,080
to get that book.

235
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,520
the book

236
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
is the ancient book

237
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
of our family.

238
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
Father said

239
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,480
to be presented at the gentleman's meeting.

240
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,720
Everyone in Lincheng knows

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,760
the Cheng family

242
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,600
made a fortune

243
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,520
with this book.

244
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,760
Legend has it that

245
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,920
the ancestors of our family

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
found it

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,520
when I was picking herbs.

248
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
It is said

249
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,080
they are all

250
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
that connects heaven and earth.

251
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,360
In it,

252
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,800
is filled with the law of heaven and earth.

253
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,880
That is

254
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,560
that ordinary people can't touch.

255
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,080
Could you please

256
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,160
not present it to a gentleman's meeting?

257
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,560
Why?

258
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
Because I heard that

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
this book

260
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
is very surprising.

261
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
What if

262
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,760
innocent people?

263
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,800
Who

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
can be taken away

265
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,520
can take it away.

266
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,480
It is said that

267
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,920
the person who can open the book

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,880
must be the chosen one.

269
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
I advise you

270
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,240
not to

271
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
on the gentleman's meeting.

272
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,520
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

273
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,080
Are you a father or am I a father?

274
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,840
It's up to you.

275
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
It's up to me.

276
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,120
Besides,

277
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,080
presenting this book

278
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,920
is my promise to people in Lincheng.

279
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,640
How can I go back on my word

280
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,480
and ruin my prestige?

281
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,920
So

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,920
you must show it.

283
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,360
Can you tell me

284
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,280
where you

285
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,040
the book?

286
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,800
I can tell you

287
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,760
Of course I can tell you.

288
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,960
But

289
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,640
I haven't got an answer

290
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,200
I asked you just now.

291
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,800
Okay.

292
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll agree to the Zhou family's marriage.

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,880
Actually,

294
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
that book

295
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
is in

296
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
in our study.

297
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,200
In the box.

298
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,320
I didn't expect

299
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,000
Father wanted to give that treasure

300
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,760
to my brother.

301
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,400
Di.

302
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
We have to hurry.

303
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,280
Cheng Qi can't

304
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
fall into Cheng Qi's hands.

305
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,680
If you insist on

306
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,600
to Cheng Qi,

307
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,840
We have only one choice.

308
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,480
to choose.

309
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,160
How?

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,720
Let Master Yuli get the book.

311
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,000
But

312
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,880
she has to promise us one thing.

313
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,640
What is it?

314
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
Master Yuli,

315
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,320
to kill Cheng Qi for us.

316
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,720
Lin.

317
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,120
Does the moon look like

318
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,760
that we often eat?

319
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Steamed pancakes with pickled vegetables.

320
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
I didn't expect

321
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
you are a fairy.

322
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,760
What?

323
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,320
Don't I look like one?

324
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,400
No.

325
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,080
It's just too sudden.

326
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,160
I can't

327
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't accept it.

328
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
But now that I think about it,

329
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,600
you do have

330
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
extraordinary and elegant temperament.

331
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
That's more like it.

332
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,520
Just like how simple

333
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,680
and simple-minded.

334
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,760
Are you praising me?

335
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,240
Yes.

336
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
Right now,

337
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,120
I feel

338
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm worse than a mortal.

339
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,440
and living like a loser.

340
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Being a fairy is so unfair.

341
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,520
I might as well be

342
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
a carefree little fairy.

343
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,880
By the way, Lin,

344
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
if you complete the mission,

345
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
will you go back to heaven?

346
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
Heaven?

347
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,880
Yes.

348
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,880
I've never thought about this.

349
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,960
It seems that

350
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
with you

351
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,920
together.

352
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,160
I thought we were the same.

353
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,840
We lived together.

354
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,520
as if we could be together forever.

355
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,520
But you're an immortal now.

356
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
What should I do

357
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,880
in this world?

358
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,480
It's okay, succulent meat.

359
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,960
Whether I'm an immortal or not,

360
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,560
our relationship will never change.

361
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
You can come to me anytime.

362
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,440
Besides,

363
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,440
What if I don't have to go back?

364
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,760
No.

365
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
You really don't have to go back.

366
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,440
No.

367
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,400
A person from heaven

368
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,640
should go back to heaven.

369
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
Humans and demons

370
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,320
can't live together.

371
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,440
As long as she's an immortal,

372
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,560
when she accomplishes her mission,

373
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
she must return to the Heavenly Realm.

374
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,640
Unless I get pardoned.

375
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,720
But look at me now.

376
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,400
how can I complete the task?

377
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,160
Lin, don't worry.

378
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,920
There will be a way before the mountain.

379
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,400
What’s more,

380
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,440
just don't follow it.

381
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
That's easy for you to say.

382
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,640
If the nightmare

383
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
get the divine memorandum,

384
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,600
it's not about

385
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,720
whether we live or not.

386
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,880
In this world,

387
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
in this world

388
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
to sacrifice?

389
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,080
I know where the Book of Heaven is.

390
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,280
Where is it?

391
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,560
Father said

392
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,640
the Book of Heaven is in the study.

393
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,440
in the study.

394
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,080
Then...

395
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,640
is it the box

396
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,520
under the Buddha statue?

397
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,760
Impossible.

398
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,200
It's so precious.

399
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,680
How can you leave it here?

400
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
You'll know when you see it, right?

401
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,240
Wait.

402
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,480
The divine memorandum is a spirit object.

403
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,240
There must be spiritual energy.

404
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,840
can move or open it

405
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
can move or open it.

406
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,360
The Chosen One.

407
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,320
Let me try.

408
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,880
Wait.

409
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,720
Hide first.

410
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,480
Are you sure the divine memorandum is here?

411
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,200
They won't lie to me.

412
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,880
They won't be so stupid

413
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,080
to risk their lives?

414
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
There's a box here.

415
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,079
Could this be...

416
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
the book

417
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,880
to find.

418
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,960
Is it a divine book?

419
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,119
Open it and you'll know.

420
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,320
It's not the time

421
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
to take away the book.

422
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,120
we shouldn't stay here for long.

423
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,880
Let's go.

424
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,080
I didn't expect

425
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,040
someone

426
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
a barrier here.

427
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,840
If you hadn't stopped me just now,

428
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,960
I would have been killed.

429
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,040
Mr. Cheng.

430
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Why don't you give it a try?

431
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,960
to see if you are the Chosen One.

432
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
Try it if you want.

433
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,360
Brother Xu.

434
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,040
Tell me.

435
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,080
why can't we

436
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,920
take it away?

437
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,640
In my opinion,

438
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,040
no matter who

439
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,160
it's not that easy

440
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,520
to take this divine book away.

441
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,040
We can't take it.

442
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,400
The same goes for the nightmare.
