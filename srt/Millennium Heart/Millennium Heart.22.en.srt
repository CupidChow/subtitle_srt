1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,920
Your Highness. Your Highness.

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,600
How's it going? I'm fine.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,000
The book

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
in Cheng Mansion.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,840
or in the academy.

6
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,320
Your Majesty, I am sorry.

7
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,760
Do you remember your right hand?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
Back then,

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,600
how much you hated

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,120
your body.

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
When I think about the pain you suffered in Heaven Realm,

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,240
I can't help but feel pain.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,560
Only when we get the divine memorandum,

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,760
can you get rid of

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
and Demon Realm.

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
I can unify the Three Realms

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
and be immortal.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,280
And we

19
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,039
we don't have to suffer from the pain of suppression anymore.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
We can be together

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
forever.

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
You're loyal to me.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,800
I won't blame you.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,680
My Lord.

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,880
I will

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,560
get the book for you.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,440
Madam.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,240
I’m afraid Mr. Cheng won’t come today.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,080
No?

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,440
Yes.

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,240
I heard from the people in Madam's mansion that

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Young Master Cheng Qi is getting married.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,760
What?

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
Cheng Qi is getting married?

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,120
I can't let him get married.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The one who knows it will win.

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,360
Young Master.

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,880
Young Master.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,080
This is

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,600
you just wanted.

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I brought it for you.

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
You need a letter?

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
What a loser.

44
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,240
Put it on.

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,600
Young Master.

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
What about the tea?

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
I've prepared some for you.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,200
Are you going now?

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,280
Where?

50
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,760
The main hall.

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,760
Didn’t you ask

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,160
Cheng Di,

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,680
come to visit us?

54
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Cheng Di?

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Yes.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,200
The richest man in Lincheng.

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
The second son of the Cheng family.

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
Why did you forget?

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Good timing.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,800
Where is the main hall?

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Young master

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
acting weird today?

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,960
You may leave.

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,800
Please enjoy.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,080
Li,

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,440
Why did you suddenly invite me

67
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
to your mansion for tea?

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,159
I don't think

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,480
I don't think we're close.

70
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
Friendship?

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,520
Could it be...

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,400
Do you want to

73
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
kill Cheng Qi?

74
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
Li, you mean...

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,640
do as I say,

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,360
your wish will be fulfilled.

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,880
I think

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
we will be

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
good friends.

80
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,040
I've been in Lincheng for so long.

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,200
I didn't know

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,280
There is such a place.

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,280
It's okay, Mother.

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,800
Let's go.

85
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Come on.

86
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,400
Di.

87
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,920
Are you sure it's here?

88
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,920
Mother, don't worry.

89
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,200
Brother Ning Yuan told me.

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,000
It can't be wrong.

91
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
Why is this place so weird?

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Is there

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,240
in the water?

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
It's okay, Mother.

95
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,160
Don't worry.

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,080
Di.

97
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,400
Forget it. Let's go back.

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
Since we're here,

99
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

100
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,400
to leave without saying goodbye.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,159
Are you Master Yuli?

102
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,159
Mr. Cheng.

103
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,000
What can I do for you?

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,240
She knows I’m Mr. Cheng.

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,720
She must be a master.

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,440
Let's go.

107
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,680
Since you know

108
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,560
I’m Mr. Cheng.

109
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,280
I think I still have

110
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
in Lincheng.

111
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
Master Yuli,

112
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,880
We are your disciples.

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,560
your disciple.

114
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm here today

115
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,080
to ask you

116
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
to ask you for help.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
It's not

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,560
a big deal.

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
to ask you

120
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,640
to give me an idea.

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,440
I

122
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
the Second Master Cheng’s.

123
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
It’s not a high position.

124
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,520
Besides,

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,480
Cheng Di is his only son.

126
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,280
He has a brother.

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,960
is the son of his wife.

128
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
Let alone Di,

129
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
is a few years younger than him.

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
he must

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,600
his brother Cheng Qi.

132
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,600
Now Cheng Qi is getting married.

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
It's not that we don't miss him.

134
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,080
to marry him.

135
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,240
But you don't know

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,280
his brother Cheng Qi

137
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,040
has a heart disease since childhood.

138
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,720
If you give birth in the future,

139
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,120
our family

140
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,240
have to

141
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,320
for the rest of your life.

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,000
and be laughed at

143
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,600
in Lincheng.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
I did this

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,960
for the sake of our family.

146
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,840
Then,

147
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,560
what can you exchange with me?

148
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,880
Money.

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,080
If we succeed,

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,080
we have plenty of gold and silver.

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,840
I don’t care about those.

152
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,799
I want your family heirloom.

153
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,120
Master,

154
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
I don't know

155
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,880
you're talking about.

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
The divine memorandum.

157
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Master Yuli is really powerful.

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,080
You actually know

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
I have such a treasure.

160
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
It belongs to my master.

161
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
He has a good heart.

162
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,480
What?

163
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,200
I can't.

164
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,520
Of course you can.

165
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,920
But

166
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
I need to see Cheng Qi's

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,120
Cheng Qi.

168
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
Don't worry.

169
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,680
I will show you

170
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,480
Aim at the heart.

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Okay.

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,160
Try it. Try it.

173
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,720
I'll teach you.

174
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,480
Pinch here.

175
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,960
What are you looking at?

176
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,840
Like this.

177
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,960
No.

178
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,920
Cheng Qi.

179
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,840
I think archery is so hard.

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,520
Teach me.

181
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,080
Teach me.

182
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,600
Lin.

183
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
Do you have a sore throat?

184
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,600
No.

185
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,240
Why are you talking like that?

186
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
I can't shoot.

187
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,160
It's okay. Take your time.

188
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,400
Will you teach me or not?

189
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,760
One more.

190
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,160
Teach me

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,680
Amazing.

192
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,120
Look. Isn't it amazing?

193
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,640
It's okay.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,920
You may not

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,560
in a short time,

196
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240
like me.

197
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,480
But

198
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,040
under my guidance,

199
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
You know how to do it.

200
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,040
Of course I can.

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,800
Why can't you understand?

202
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,600
Stupid.

203
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,640
Three.

204
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,040
I got it.

205
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,000
Women are hard to understand.

206
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

207
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,680
Okay.

208
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,960
Cheng Qi and Cheng Lin

209
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,760
are definitely not siblings.

210
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
I think all of us

211
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,480
can see that

212
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,360
you hate that girl too, right?

213
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,240
How about

214
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,600
we teach her a lesson?

215
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,760
Look at this.

216
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,000
How do you want to treat it?

217
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
How?

218
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,240
Coming.

219
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,240
My book.

220
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
Did I leave it at your place last time?

221
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,480
Here.

222
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Let's go.

223
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,480
He should be here soon.

224
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,960
Hurry up.

225
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,520
Did your hand hurt just now?

226
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,440
My hand?

227
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,160
Let me see.

228
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,680
It's okay.

229
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,680
Cheng Qi.

230
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
You're not romantic at all.

231
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,400
What a piece of wood.

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,760
Rotten wood?

233
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,560
What's going on?

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Why did the table collapse?

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,880
I don't know.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Yeah

237
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,560
Are you okay?

238
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Oh my god. Get it done.

239
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,760
Don't vent your anger on the table.

240
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,640
Lin.

241
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,120
What happened?

242
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,280
Come.

243
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,400
Lin, are you okay?

244
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,400
Who did this?

245
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,240
Joo Jung-yeon.

246
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,680
It's you, right?

247
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,760
Mr. Cheng.

248
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
There are so many people here.

249
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Why are you so sure that I did it?

250
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
I have no evidence.

251
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,320
Why did you frame me?

252
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,800
Because the school

253
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,720
is owned by your family?

254
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,360
Just because Cheng Lin is

255
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,320
your so-called cousin?

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,360
Is that why you

257
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
without any evidence.

258
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,800
Exactly.

259
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,360
Who are you to frame me?

260
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
Jung-yeon.

261
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,240
Jung Yeon treats you well.

262
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,200
But you,

263
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,120
your relationship with Cheng Lin

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,080
with Cheng Lin.

265
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,800
in front of the scholars

266
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,040
in front of the scholars.

267
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,640
Don't you know that?

268
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,800
How dare you lecture others?

269
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
It's not the Cheng family's style.

270
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,160
Tan Miaoyer.

271
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,240
You've gone too far.

272
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,160
Let's go. Let's go.

273
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,440
Now that we're here, let's go. Let's go.

274
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,480
you said so,

275
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
I won’t hide it from you.

276
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,160
Cheng Lin is not my cousin.

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,920
but my fiancée.

278
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
Fiancée?

279
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
When did this happen?

280
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,560
Why didn't I know?

281
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,840
Lin.

282
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,760
Actually,

283
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
I wanted to talk to you alone.

284
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,720
I told my parents

285
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
to marry you.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
Although you're alone,

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,480
I, Cheng Qi,

288
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
I'll be a matchmaker.

289
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,400
Ten miles of red makeup.

290
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,360
Take the wedding team and the palanquin

291
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,640
to marry you.

292
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,360
Everything

293
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
everything that should be.

294
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
If you are willing,

295
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
we'll get married another day.

296
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
I'll take you to the clinic now.

297
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,040
No need.

298
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
It's really okay.

299
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:29,960
No.

300
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I told you

301
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,640
hurt you.

302
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,520
Not even a little.

303
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,760
It's so lively.

304
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,760
Please

305
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,640
Please come in.

306
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,800
Councillor Zhou

307
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,680
Welcome.

308
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Thank you

309
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,960
Come in please

310
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,920
Welcome.

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,880
My name is Lin.

312
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
I'm here

313
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,320
to be the bride.

314
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,360
is really different.

315
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,560
I've never seen

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
such a gentle and beautiful Lin.

317
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,640
He's totally different.

318
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,560
Why are you here?

319
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,280
Why can't I come?

320
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
You look

321
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,160
today.

322
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:19,960
Of course.

323
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,560
Because you're getting married.

324
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,120
Me getting married?

325
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,040
It's none of your business.

326
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
Of course.

327
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm your only family.

328
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,520
When you get married,

329
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,360
Of course I will

330
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,520
to Mr. Cheng.

331
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,600
Let him take care of you forever.

332
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
and take care of you.

333
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
That way, I can be at ease.

334
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
I wrote this these days.

335
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,720
I know you'll be nervous.

336
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,120
I prepared it for you.

337
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
When did you become so sensible?

338
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,280
Thank you, succulent meat.

339
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Thank you.

340
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,080
No matter where you are,

341
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,560
you'll always be my sister.

342
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,440
What else?

343
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,800
You want to leave me?

344
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
Take that over first.

345
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay.

346
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,320
It's done here.

347
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,840
Be careful.

348
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,320
Got it.

349
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,600
Be quick.

350
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,840
Yes, madam.

351
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,600
Is the food ready?

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,280
Almost.
