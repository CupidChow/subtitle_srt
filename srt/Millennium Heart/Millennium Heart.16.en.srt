1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,400
If you're ready

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,440
let's begin.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,080
Wait.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,960
Me too.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,520
Okay.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,640
The audition begins.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Don't be embarrassed.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,840
I can't help her this time.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,240
Music.

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,039
Here we go.

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,200
It's flying!

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,000
Amazing!

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,880
Cheng Lin.

14
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,360
Awesome!

15
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,200
Okay.

16
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,040
Good job.

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,160
You danced so well.

18
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,200
Great.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,960
Great! Great!

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,680
So pretty.

21
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
Amazing. So beautiful.

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,880
Cheng Lin, you've hidden something.

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,240
Good.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,760
Okay.

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Please be quiet.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
This selection is undoubtedly

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,079
The winner

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Cheng Lin.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,800
Awesome. Congratulations.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,079
Congratulations, Cheng Lin.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,040
See? I told you.

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,680
It must be her.

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,320
So beautiful.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,200
Why are you blushing?

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
It's a little hot today.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,320
Right?

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,079
It's hot, right?

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,520
It's a little hot.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,560
Great

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,520
Great dance.

41
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,040
Next,

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
we are going to

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
the music competition.

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,480
The students will compete

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,400
in the form of playing the piano.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Those who fail will be eliminated automatically.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
Are you ready?

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
Yes.

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,080
Wanwan, come on.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,480
OK.

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,040
I announce

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
The game starts now.

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
What does this mean?

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,880
This is the sound of the forest.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,760
The sound of the forest?

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,079
Could it be the sound of the bamboo forest?

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,880
Interesting.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,680
Wanwan, come on.

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,880
Wanwan is good at playing.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,440
Right?

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,240
What is this?

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,000
What does it mean?

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,600
I don't know.

64
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,760
I know.

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,200
So this is

66
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,400
the sound of crossing.

67
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,920
So smart

68
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
You're so smart.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,800
This...

70
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,320
OK.

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,600
I announce that

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,040
Joo Jung-yeon wins.

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Congratulations, Jung-yeon.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,480
Congratulations

76
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Congratulations Jung-yeon

77
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Everyone

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,440
Come on.

79
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Let's raise our glasses

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,160
to celebrate

81
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,840
Mr. Cheng and Lin

82
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,680
will get three places

83
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,480
on behalf of Lincheng Academy.

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,320
Cheers.

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
Cheers. Cheers.

86
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,760
Actually,

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,240
I was just lucky today.

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,360
In my opinion,

89
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,800
the most unexpected

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,680
is our Lin.

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,600
Lin.

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
When did you learn to dance?

93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
So good.

94
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,480
It can fly

95
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,400
Fly to the sky

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,440
Really?

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,360
Lin.

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,760
You are really amazing today.

99
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,159
You have no idea

100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
our Lin

101
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
is the one that lasts a thousand years.

102
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Thousand years.

103
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,840
A thousand years of fortune.

104
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,600
Fate.

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
Yes, fate.

106
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,480
Fate

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,360
It turns out

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
are all gifted.

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,120
Lin.

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,520
To Talent.

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,280
To Talent.

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,840
Wanwan.

113
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,640
Actually,

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,760
today.

115
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
Although you didn't get the ranking,

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,040
but you can play

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,240
such a difficult song.

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,640
It's good enough.

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,920
Although I

120
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,960
this time,

121
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
But I tried my best.

122
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,160
And I did

123
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,840
better than usual.

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,760
I have no regrets.

125
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,360
Besides,

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,400
Cheng Lin

127
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,760
got the spot for beauty selection.

128
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
I'm also happy.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,160
Wanwan,

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
I’m glad

131
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm glad.

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,640
Here.

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Cheers.

134
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,520
Wait, wait, wait.

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Let's do it.

136
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,080
Cheers!

137
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,440
Cheng Lin.

138
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,440
Don’t worry.

139
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
I won’t be

140
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,800
cowardly Zhang Wanwan anymore.

141
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,159
I want to be like you.

142
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,680
like you.

143
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,840
Be

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,200
a new person.

145
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,840
I, Hongli,

146
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,800
From now on,

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
I will be reborn

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,120
and be a new person.

149
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,280
Come on, Wanwan.

150
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,880
Cheers to our friendship.

151
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
Cheers! Cheers!

152
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Cheers

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,240
Come on.

154
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,960
For Wanwan.

155
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
So many stars. So beautiful.

156
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,240
No matter how beautiful the stars are,

157
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
it won't light up the dark night sky.

158
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,080
You have your reason

159
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
to say that.

160
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
Although so many stars

161
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,600
can't light up the dark night sky,

162
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,600
But every star

163
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,800
is trying to

164
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,320
their own light and light.

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,040
Even when the sun breaks,

166
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,360
they still exist.

167
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,040
right?

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,880
So,

169
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,040
the stars made the night.

170
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Because of them,

171
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,800
the night becomes more beautiful.

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
Have you thought about

173
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
about what I told you?

174
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
It's okay.

175
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
But are you sure

176
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
be in danger?

177
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,120
I’ve asked Master Yuli.

178
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
You praised me

179
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,240
you praised me for being smart.

180
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,400
But it's true.

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,840
It's fake.

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,920
It's real.

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
Are you ready?

184
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,600
Wait.

185
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,800
Master,

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,960
Is this really

187
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,880
to Cheng Qi?

188
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
Of course not.

189
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,040
What are you thinking about?

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,520
Just close your eyes.

191
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
I'll start now.

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,560
Cheng Qi.

193
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,360
Cheng Qi.

194
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,440
Are you okay?

195
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,000
Cheng Qi.

196
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,560
Master.

197
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
Didn't you say he'll be fine?

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm fine.

199
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
Are you really okay?

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm really fine.

201
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,640
Don't worry.

202
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I'll prescribe medicine

203
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
to help him recover.

204
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,120
Thank you, Master.

205
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,120
My Lord.

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
How is the task

207
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
I asked you to do?

208
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
Everything is ready.

209
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,480
Soon,

210
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
their body and consciousness

211
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,840
will be used by us.

212
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,000
Let them die

213
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,480
as you wish.

214
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,840
Good job.

215
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,400
Remember.

216
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't make any more mistakes.

217
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,760
Ao Qi,

218
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,960
You wouldn't have thought

219
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,080
I'm stronger than before.

220
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,440
What's wrong? Are you stuffed?

221
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,080
I just arrived.

222
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,000
I just think

223
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm tired of

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm tired of it.

225
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
You don't have a fever.

226
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,320
Don't you always

227
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,240
what you want?

228
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,640
I do.

229
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,760
I used to think

230
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,000
a good life like this.

231
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,760
But what Zhang Wanwan said

232
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,600
Zhang Wanwan said

233
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,720
touched me.

234
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,680
I think my life

235
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,080
is a little boring.

236
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,200
It's degrading and worthless.

237
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,960
Besides,

238
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,000
I also think these delicacies

239
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,440
are not as delicious as before.

240
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,640
Maybe I'm used to wandering around.

241
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
Such a good life.

242
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
I get tired

243
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,200
after a long time.

244
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,080
Come on.

245
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,200
Here.

246
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Let me tell you a secret.

247
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,280
My Internal Dan

248
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,120
will be back soon.

249
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,640
How did you get it back?

250
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,080
Jun Xu said

251
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,920
that my Internal Dan

252
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
with Cheng Qi's body.

253
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,360
We can't get it back for now.

254
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,080
But we found a sorcerer.

255
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,000
Do you remember?

256
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,640
Is it

257
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,120
the master we hunted that day?

258
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,320
was her.

259
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,240
That means

260
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,320
we can leave now.

261
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,400
Let's go.

262
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,560
Not yet.

263
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,560
Why?

264
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,640
Isn't the Internal Dan

265
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,280
the Internal Dan?

266
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,240
Yes, I did.

267
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
But there's only half of it.

268
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
I have to cultivate every day

269
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,040
and make a new pill.

270
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,600
The other half

271
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,880
in Mr. Cheng’s body?

272
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
This is the way

273
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
gave us this idea.

274
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
If we don't do this,

275
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,080
Cheng Qi might be in danger.

276
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,160
I see.

277
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,680
But...

278
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,320
we can

279
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,600
practice in Cheng Mansion.

280
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,120
and go back to Ruyi Temple,

281
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,200
Isn't it more peaceful?

282
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,240
You're right.

283
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
Then why should I stay here?

284
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,840
I don't need him anymore.

285
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,920
He doesn't need me anymore.

286
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240
But our Ruyi Temple

287
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,960
is too bad.

288
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,840
What if

289
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
during the process?

290
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,920
You...

291
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,480
You're being extravagant and frugal.

292
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,319
No.

293
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm just worried about Cheng Qi.

294
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,880
Worried about Cheng Qi?

295
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,119
Worried about Cheng Qi?

296
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,640
Do you really

297
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,520
really like Cheng Qi?

298
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,800
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,720
Aren't you worried?

300
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,920
Stop quibbling.

301
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,160
You're blushing.

302
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,800
Shut up.

303
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,359
I'll tell him now.

304
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,119
Wait.

305
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
I'll tell you the truth.

306
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,440
I know that once the Internal Dan comes back,

307
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,920
we

308
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,480
need each other anymore.

309
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
But we've been together

310
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,600
for so long.

311
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,920
I have to watch him

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
get well.

313
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,560
Right?

314
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,360
Succulent meat.

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,360
I know you have been

316
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,720
you've been staying with me

317
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,080
I was bored and frustrated.

318
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,560
But I promise you,

319
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,000
we'll leave immediately

320
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,000
we'll leave immediately.

321
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Leave here.

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
and go back to

323
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,120
our own free life.

324
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,680
OK?

325
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,880
Lin.

326
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
I was just kidding.

327
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,720
If you really want to stay,

328
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
I can stay.

329
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,040
and help Mr. Cheng recover.

330
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,840
You are right.

331
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
Let's be good to the end.

332
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm just whining.

333
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,760
If you really like

334
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,520
this kind of life,

335
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,800
I like it too.

336
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Don't comfort me.

337
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,160
You're right.

338
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,080
I want to

339
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,800
I want to end it.

340
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,760
After all,

341
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm a demon.

342
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,480
He is human.

343
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
We have different paths.

344
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
I've already made up my mind.

345
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
After the gentleman meeting,

346
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,960
we'll leave here.

347
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
and go back

348
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,840
our own world.

349
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,280
Happy revenge
