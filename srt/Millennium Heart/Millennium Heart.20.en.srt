1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,880
Cheng Qi.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,760
Why do I smell

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,040
It smells burning.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,000
Is it burnt?

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,360
The fish

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,240
The fish is burnt.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:29,920
It's okay.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,760
It tastes better when the fish is burnt.

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,360
I didn't expect

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,160
there would be such a fairyland in the mortal world.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,560
The spiritual energy here is strong.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,080
It's perfect for training.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,720
Maybe...

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,520
this is the paradise.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,320
Then you and I are immortals.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,600
Maybe

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,039
you're not a fairy,

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,320
but a fairy?

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm not a mortal either.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
but a descendant of the Dragon Clan.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,800
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,240
What's wrong?

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,840
It's all my fault.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
I know you haven't fully recovered,

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm still like this.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,320
It doesn't hurt anymore.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,240
It's not me.

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,120
Just the two of us here.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
If it's not you, then it's me.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,120
Alright.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I'll get something to eat.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
to fill someone's stomach.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,800
Of course men

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,400
Of course we men should go.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,320
Okay.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,680
I'll wait

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
Go find something for me.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,199
Sure.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,880
Just wait.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,640
It won't hurt anymore.

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,400
Lin,

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,320
Although you don't admit it,

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
I know

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,960
you have Mr. Cheng in your heart.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,280
I’m sure.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,520
No way.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,720
[Did I really fall in love with him?]

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,079
Stop!

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,720
Stop!

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,400
Stop!

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,480
Stop running.

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,920
You're a man.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,320
You can't even catch up with a chicken.

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,200
I didn't expect

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,880
there would be a cave sky here.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,880
Someone must have lived here.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,960
Cheng Qi.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,440
It's here. It's here.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
This mural

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,240
is vivid

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,640
It seems to be describing

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
about a couple of fairies and fairies.

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,800
Look here.

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
It seems to be a war between immortals and demons.

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,040
Men and fairies

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,840
must be lovers.

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
Unfortunately,

69
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
they all died in the end.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,080
Don't be sad.

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,960
Maybe it's just

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,960
a fairy tale.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,240
I just feel sorry

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,960
for them.

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
It seems

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,000
deities have their own destiny.

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,120
But lovers can’t be together.

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,480
I believe

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
they will continue their relationship.

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,920
They will be together eventually.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,880
Lin.

82
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,400
Lin.

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,680
What are you thinking?

84
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,040
Nothing.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,320
Why are you blushing?

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Am I?

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
I'm just hungry.

88
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Where is the chicken?

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
You did your best.

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,200
The rest is up to them.

91
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,679
Because at that time,

92
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,480
my power was weak.

93
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,679
I'm just a little demon.

94
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,520
can never

95
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
change anyone's fate.

96
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,960
Everything has its own destiny.

97
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
So,

98
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
at that time,

99
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,240
Cheng Qi.

100
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,640
Cheng Qi.

101
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,880
Are you asleep?

102
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,200
Try to recall

103
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
When you get close to Mr. Cheng,

104
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
when you get close to Mr. Cheng?

105
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,600
and your face is still hot?

106
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,720
If you want to return the Internal Dan to Cheng Qi,

107
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,680
It's simple.

108
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
Think about

109
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
how the Internal Dan entered

110
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,680
his body?

111
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,880
Whatever.

112
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,440
Now!

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,280
Give him back the Internal Dan first.

114
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,560
How is it?

115
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,200
Not good?

116
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,120
Yes.

117
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
Mr. Cheng recovered very quickly.

118
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,720
He's fine now.

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,920
You can go back now.

120
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Di.

121
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,360
Are you sure?

122
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
Don't talk nonsense.

123
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,120
If Master finds out

124
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
he will be furious

125
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
he might get mad

126
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,640
to punish us.

127
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,040
Is what I said true?

128
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,000
I happened to

129
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Cheng Qi.

130
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,160
and got close to a man.

131
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
They even touch each other.

132
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,480
Besides,

133
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,520
he even took that man in his residence.

134
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,000
So,

135
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
Cheng Qi

136
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,760
has a tendency to break sleeves.

137
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
If that's the case,

138
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,080
we will

139
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,160
sit on Mount Tai.

140
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,720
Di.

141
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,840
Remember,

142
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
Keep an eye on Cheng Qi.

143
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,200
Don't worry, Mother.

144
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm always watching you.

145
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,760
But recently,

146
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
I haven't seen Cheng Qi.

147
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,640
There's no movement in his residence.

148
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm afraid he went somewhere.

149
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,960
There must be a ghost.

150
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,400
And his distant relative.

151
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,360
I've never heard

152
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
Mrs. Cheng mentioned it.

153
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,000
Where did they come from?

154
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,800
Cousin,

155
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,800
I do remember something.

156
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,040
I just can't remember.

157
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,360
How is that possible?

158
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
You only played with

159
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
with the maids here.

160
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,840
I've never brought you

161
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,040
with you.

162
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,880
Really?

163
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,440
Di,

164
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,960
you must make me proud.

165
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,400
If you

166
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,360
you inherit the family business,

167
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,600
the heirloom must be yours.

168
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,120
Do you know how precious that ancient book is?

169
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
I know that ancient book is rare,

170
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,880
but I didn't

171
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,760
from my father.

172
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,240
The people in the mansion

173
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
never mentioned it.

174
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,400
Just like that treasure.

175
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,400
there is

176
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,560
a secret.

177
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,040
Sit.

178
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,800
Di.

179
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,120
You've grown up.

180
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,040
I should tell you something.

181
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,920
But

182
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,080
don't tell anyone.

183
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,720
This is the secret

184
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
from Master.

185
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,080
It's amazing.

186
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,080
Is this ancient book really so magical?

187
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,520
It's ordered Xihe

188
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,360
to the sky

189
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
The calendar is the sun, moon and stars.

190
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,160
to bestow upon the people.

191
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm assigned to Xi Zhong.

192
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,320
The house is called the valley.

193
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,600
The sun rises and the sun rises.

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
Ao Qi.

195
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,360
Ao Qi.

196
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,280
It must be you.

197
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,160
Come out.

198
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,920
Did it hurt?

200
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,520
Did it hurt?

201
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
What did you throw at me?

202
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,840
I didn't expect to hurt you.

203
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,840
What is this?

204
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,000
Ao Qi.

205
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,280
Ao Qi.

206
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,600
You go first.

207
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,080
He can't have the divine memorandum.

208
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,560
No.

209
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,760
Let's go.

210
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,240
What is this?

211
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,720
It's so beautiful.

212
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,400
This is the Water Magic Jade from the East Sea.

213
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,240
The dragon on it

214
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,880
was carved by my spiritual power.

215
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,560
Do you like it?

216
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,160
Yes.

217
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,880
This is for me?

218
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Shamo.

219
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,320
live on.

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,440
I hope

221
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,920
you can wear

222
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,040
every day.

223
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,440
When you see this dragon,

224
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,320
you must think of me.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,839
Ao Qi.
