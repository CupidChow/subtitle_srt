1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Who is that

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,120
You've lost weight. I've gained weight.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,760
Look who that is.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,080
He's so handsome.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,800
Isn't that Jun Xu?

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,800
This is the

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,600
I mentioned.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,240
is pretty.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,720
Hello, students.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,440
I'm your new

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,240
Mr. Martial Arts.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,080
My name is Jun Xu.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
I'll teach you

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,760
in the future.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,440
You're a martial arts teacher.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,120
What are you doing?

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,720
What are you doing?

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,440
This is too much.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,480
How could you hurt him?

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
How did you meet?

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,120
It's really great.

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,120
From now on,

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,440
in the future.

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,320
Me too.

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,040
Are you the new martial arts teacher?

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,080
Yes.

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,920
I heard that the new martial artist

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,840
is highly skilled in martial arts.

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,120
I didn't expect

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,039
a young talent.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Sorry for offending you just now.

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,720
Please forgive me.

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm your teacher

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
and your friend.

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,840
In the future,

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,240
in the future.

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,080
What is martial arts?

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,240
Martial arts, fighting is martial arts.

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Technique, Communication of Destiny.

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Act according to the rules.

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,320
We learn martial arts

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,440
is to strengthen our body,

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,160
instead of fighting.

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,039
Who said

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,800
You want to practice the piano? Yes.

46
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,400
What?

47
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,640
It's only been a while.

48
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,840
in just a short time.

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,039
I don't need you to teach me anyway.

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,440
Jun Xu will teach me, right?

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,360
You're always welcome.

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,560
Sure.

53
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Shall we start tonight?

54
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:47,920
Wait.

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,039
You mean

56
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,600
you want Mr. Xu

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
to live in my house.

58
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,920
Yes.

59
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,280
Why didn't I think of that?

60
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,400
Mr. Xu.

61
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,000
Why don't you stay here tonight?

62
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,800
You can teach me every day.

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,440
You're a guest.

64
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,880
You still want to invite someone?

65
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Shouldn't you ask

66
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,440
my opinion?

67
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
I don't need your opinion.

68
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,720
If you have a problem,

69
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,280
I'll stay at Mr. Xu's house.

70
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,840
That's enough.

71
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,720
Mr. Xu.

72
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,720
We'll

73
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,720
this matter.

74
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,520
Don't get involved.

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,200
I...

76
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,520
Mr. Xu.

77
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Can I have a word with you?

78
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,240
Mr. Xu.

79
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,600
Where do you live now?

80
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,040
The house behind the academy.

81
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,000
The house behind the academy.

82
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
That's not a place to stay.

83
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,720
Nothing.

84
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
I was homeless everywhere.

85
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,640
It's not about good or bad.

86
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
I understand your pain of studying abroad.

87
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
So is Hongli.

88
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,720
I talked to him ruthlessly.

89
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
I know his difficulty.

90
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,240
How about this?

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,040
You can stay in my house.

92
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,680
First,

93
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,960
you can teach Lin.

94
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,760
Second,

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
you can teach me.

96
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,000
I can.

97
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
As long as it's convenient for you.

98
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,920
Of course.

99
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,120
That's great.

100
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
What are you mumbling about?

101
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,720
We've been discussing for so long.

102
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Have you figured out anything?

103
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,880
Miss Lin. Mr. Cheng.

104
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,360
I’ll leave now.

105
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,800
Seo.

106
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
Greetings, Father and Mother.

107
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,400
Concubine Jin.

108
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,079
Have a seat.

109
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,240
Have a seat.

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,240
Master.

111
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,960
Master.

112
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,840
When did you take in a disciple?

113
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,160
Why didn't I know?

114
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,280
Mrs. Cheng.

115
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,960
Master promised to teach me how to play the piano.

116
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Look at Qi.

117
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,520
is so popular.

118
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,480
I can tell that

119
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,720
in daily life.

120
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,880
In this world,

121
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,400
unlike Di.

122
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,720
I use it to read when I'm free.

123
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,200
Read?

124
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,200
Cheng Di works so hard now.

125
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,200
I didn’t know.

126
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,120
I tested him before.

127
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,160
he didn't answer

128
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
He didn't answer it.

129
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Where did he

130
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,480
use this time?

131
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,040
You're right.

132
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,160
In terms of study,

133
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm not as good as my brother.

134
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,880
So I dare not

135
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
to be like my brother.

136
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
and even get close to men.

137
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
I’m afraid

138
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,640
my reputation

139
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
my father’s reputation.

140
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Brother

141
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,880
You really dare to do anything.

142
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,240
Cheng Di

143
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
Don’t talk nonsense.

144
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm not.

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
You were the one who mocked me first.

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Of course I have to expose you.

147
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,360
Tell me.

148
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Are you done?

149
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,160
Are you done?

150
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
How inappropriate!

151
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm not dead yet.

152
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
Who are you to talk?

153
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,080
Let's eat.

154
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Huang,

155
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm sorry.

156
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Brother Cheng.

157
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
We're family.

158
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
We're family.

159
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,280
Here, a toast to you.

160
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,640
Cheng Qi.

161
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Cheng Qi.

162
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,600
I'm talking to you.

163
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
Why does your face stink?

164
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,480
None of your business.

165
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
There's a lantern festival tonight.

166
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
Why don't you come with me?

167
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,280
I heard it's very beautiful.

168
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm not going.

169
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,840
You can go by yourself.

170
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,200
Fine.

171
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Why are you yelling at me?

172
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
You're petty.

173
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,880
Yes.

174
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm petty.

175
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
You can go with whoever you want.

176
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,480
Just go with him.

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
It's just a reunion dinner.

178
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
It's like we're having explosives.

179
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
I'm being kind.

180
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
The falling flowers are meant to flow.

181
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,080
The flowing water is merciless to bury flowers.

182
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,600
Shut up!

183
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,960
I’m pissed off.

184
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,880
Lin.

185
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
The moon is just right today.

186
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
Aren't you going to the lantern festival?

187
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,760
Why don't you go out for a walk?

188
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,320
Okay.

189
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,560
Let's go now.

190
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's go.

191
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,520
Me too.

192
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Really?

193
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,200
Okay.

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,120
Okay.

195
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay.

196
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,120
So beautiful.

197
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,360
Come on.

198
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,320
Let's go.

199
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,400
Okay.

200
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,480
I'll wait for you here.

201
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,200
I want this.

202
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,200
Here you go.

203
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,600
Give it to me.

204
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,840
Okay.

205
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Okay.

206
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,880
So pretty.

207
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,360
Come on

208
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

209
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,440
Look how beautiful it is.

210
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,040
Look.

211
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,040
The fireworks are beautiful.

212
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,440
The moon today

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,160
is also big and round.

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,320
The Guanghan Palace where Chang'e lives

215
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,120
will be more beautiful.

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
A long time ago

217
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
I once

218
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,280
with someone.

219
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,640
At that time, the moon was like night.

220
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,160
At that time,

221
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,480
said the same thing to you.

222
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
I guess

223
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,400
your lover.

224
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,960
That person

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,040
is my confidant.

226
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
I know him for a long time,

227
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,280
I feel so familiar.

228
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,559
This person must have

229
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,559
experienced a lot

230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,799
that makes people

231
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
feel so at ease.

232
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Mr. Xu is modest

233
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,160
and knowledgeable.

234
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,560
A teacher and a friend.

235
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
You must be very popular.

236
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,080
It's obvious.

237
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,360
He's someone who can be trusted.

238
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,120
I hope so.

239
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
I hope

240
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,560
I can be your confidant.

241
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,040
Now I am.

242
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
From now on,

243
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,560
we are bosom friends.

244
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,640
By the way,

245
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Is the confidant you just mentioned

246
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
also a woman?

247
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,800
You haven't seen each other for a long time?

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,440
Where is she now?

249
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,800
She...

250
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,400
is far away

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
and near.

252
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,000
I wonder

253
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,720
what Cheng Qi is doing now.

254
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Seriously.

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,520
It's a rare moon.

256
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,600
Why should I miss him?

257
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,240
Lin.

258
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,400
Why does this person

259
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,600
always disturbs you?

260
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,800
Look.

261
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,640
The fireworks are beautiful.

262
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
That one is pretty too.

263
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,960
The color is beautiful.

264
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,680
Let me see.

265
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,760
Look at that. It's so pretty.

266
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,000
Lanterns.

267
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,000
Lin.

268
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,320
Isn't that Cheng Di?

269
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,360
and Hongli?

270
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,800
Yes.

271
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,760
Why are they

272
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
together?

273
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
The Great Jin Sect.

274
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,640
Where is the Great Jin Gate?

275
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
This is a famous gambling house in Lincheng.

276
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
Why do I feel

277
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
people come out here

278
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,160
are weird.

279
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,120
Forget it.

280
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,200
This gambling house is boring.

281
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,920
There's food ahead.

282
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,600
Let's go.

283
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,120
Now you have

284
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,280
some methods.

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,800
Practice more in the future.

286
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,320
Xu,

287
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,160
What level

288
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,720
at my current level?

289
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,880
With your current condition,

290
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,960
you can use

291
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,880
little magic power.

292
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,880
Really?

293
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,360
I can use my Power too.

294
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,000
Look at Lin.

295
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,640
has been cultivating for thousands of years.

296
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,480
And succulent meat has been cultivated for hundreds of years.

297
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,240
No matter how talented you are,

298
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
you can't catch up with them for a while.

299
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,960
That means...

300
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,520
in my life

301
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
be bullied

302
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,200
by that demon.

303
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,880
Is it torturing to be with Lin?

304
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,600
Lin.

305
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,800
Don't you want to go to the lantern festival?

306
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
The moon is just right today.

307
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,640
Why don't we go out for a walk?

308
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,120
Xu,

309
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,160
With all due respect,

310
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,080
don't get too close

311
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,720
too close to her.

312
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,120
or you'll regret it.

313
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Look at me now.

314
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I even want to die.

315
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,280
Mr. Cheng said it so seriously.

316
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,280
Look at her now.

317
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,600
This is not her nature.

318
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,720
Once you know,

319
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,960
it's too late to regret.

320
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,040
Anyway, don't

321
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
get close to her.

322
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,320
By the way, Xu,

323
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
you just said

324
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,960
I can use some magic power.

325
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,520
Then, how should I use it?

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,600
Can you teach me?

327
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you want to try?

328
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,120
Yes.

329
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,280
use your power

330
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,320
with your power.

331
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,040
Okay.

332
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
I really have the power.

333
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,680
It seems that

334
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,040
needs more practice.

335
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,680
Let's go.

336
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,600
You'll say it if you're late.

337
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Let's go.

338
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,400
You bumped into me.

339
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,640
He...

340
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,560
You bumped into me.

341
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm talking to you.

342
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,720
Why don't you apologize?

343
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Why don't you apologize?

344
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,360
Big.

345
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

346
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,360
Get lost!

347
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,600
This is a big deal.

348
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,000
You hit me and yelled at me.

349
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,320
What's wrong?

350
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,960
Hey,

351
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,280
Why did you bully him?

352
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,360
I bullied him.

353
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,120
He hit someone,

354
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,720
and asked me to get lost.

355
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,120
Big.

356
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,120
It's here.

357
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,600
Sir,

358
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
Hong Li is our classmate.

359
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,680
He is upright and honest.

360
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
He would never do such a thing.

361
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,240
Impossible.

362
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,240
Ask him

363
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,880
or people around him.

364
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,960
What did he just do?

365
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,760
Yeah.

366
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,400
He hit me.

367
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,160
You want me to get lost?

368
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,800
What's wrong?

369
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Say it yourself.

370
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,880
Hong Li.

371
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,920
Hongli.

372
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,760
Let go.

373
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,800
Hongli, let go.

374
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,880
It hurts. Let go of me.

375
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,280
Let go.

376
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,760
Let go!

377
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Is he okay? Is he crazy?

378
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm fine.

379
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
Send him to the hospital first.

380
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,960
and humiliate us scholars.

381
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:21,920
Slow down.

382
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,000
Let's go.

383
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's go. Sit there.

384
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,120
He's awake.

385
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,600
I...

386
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,480
What's wrong with me?

387
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,800
You fainted.

388
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,760
Don't you know?

389
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,280
He fainted.

390
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,720
Where am I?

391
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm going to the gambling house.

392
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,320
Why are you going there?

393
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,560
None of your business.

394
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,360
Why did you stop me?

395
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,000
He's bewitched.

396
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,200
Confused?

397
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,120
Now,

398
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,320
Intangible.

399
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,960
There will be something more interesting later.

400
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,880
Brother Hong.

401
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,760
We’re here.

402
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,560
Mr. Cheng. Mr. Cheng.

403
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,480
Mr. Cheng.

404
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,240
It's been a long time.

405
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,360
It's inappropriate for you

406
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,720
It's not appropriate for you to investigate.

407
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,560
I'll go.

408
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,080
Sir, let's play.

409
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,760
Fake justice.

410
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,280
Because of the Internal Dan,

411
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,440
you may have some connection

412
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,480
in your senses.

413
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,360
Lin.

414
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,240
Lin.

415
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,560
Lin.

416
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,400
Lin.

417
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,400
Lin.

418
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,160
Lin.

419
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,880
Lin.

420
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,400
Lin.

421
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,800
Lin.

422
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,320
Lin.

423
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,920
Lin.

424
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,440
Cheng Qi.

425
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,800
Let's go.

426
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,160
No!

427
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,240
Who is that?

428
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
Why do I keep dreaming of him?
