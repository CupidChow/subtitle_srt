1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
The person in my dream

2
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,240
is you.

3
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,880
You know?

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
In my dream,

5
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,080
you are Ao Qi.

6
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,440
And my name is Ni Mo.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,800
This dream

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,680
is exactly the same

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,960
in Panling Cave.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
I was a fairy in the dream.

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,720
And you are a male fairy.

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,240
Let's fight the Demon Lord together.

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,600
In the end,

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,759
you turned into a dragon

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,120
and died.

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm standing here

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,120
right now?

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
I think about you every day.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
and dream at night.

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
You must be overthinking.

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,680
Plus the murals I saw during the day

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,320
That's why I had this dream.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
The jade pendant in my dream

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,520
looks exactly like this.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,080
Although

26
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,840
I can't remember where it came from,

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,600
but it is

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
with me.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
I don't think it's a coincidence.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,480
In my dream,

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
we seem to be protecting

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,520
something very important.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
It seems to be.

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,240
The Book of Heaven.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,760
The Book of Heaven?

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,800
Cheng Qi.

37
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,640
Cheng Qi.

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,920
What's wrong?

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm fine.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Don't worry.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
I will find the person who solved the dream

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
so that you won't have this nightmare anymore.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,600
He threw me away.

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,680
Lin.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Didn't you

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,560
hate him?

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,280
What?

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
He has a long face.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,800
and arrogant.

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm not.

51
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't say that about him.

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,440
I didn't.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,200
Really?

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,880
There's a man. There's no demon.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
That's bullying.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
What do you think

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
between a gentleman?

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,120
I don't know.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,040
It is said that

60
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,800
are different.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
I heard that a gentleman's meeting is held every four years.

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,360
Every academy

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,560
must be given a gift.

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,320
That's...

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,480
It is said that the treasure

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
is very surprising.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
Most of them are rare treasures.

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Are these treasures

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
in the gentleman's meeting?

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,200
Of course.

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,480
A gentleman.

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Many trainees want to

73
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,320
to show their strength.

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
Four years ago,

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
my father once showed me

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
at the gentleman's meeting.

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,280
It was a treasure

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,160
thousands of years ago.

79
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,440
Do you also want to

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
want to

81
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
to see these treasures?

82
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,760
Of course not.

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
I participated in the gentleman's meeting

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
to challenge myself.

85
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,840
Those treasures

86
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,920
It doesn't matter.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,839
Right.

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,000
You're the young master.

89
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
You've seen a lot since young.

90
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Of course it doesn't matter.

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,800
What about you?

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Why are you joining?

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,960
I can't say

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
I want to be with you.

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,720
I...

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Of course it's because...

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,560
Wanwan wants to join.

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
Wanwan doesn't want to go alone.

99
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
So she wanted me to be with her.

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,680
But I was chosen.

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,400
Lin.

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,840
I didn't.

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,720
I know.

104
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,720
You want to

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,480
to join the competition with your cousin.

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
No, I...

107
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,520
Actually...

108
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,680
don’t call me

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Cheng Lin’s cousin.

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,159
I don’t have a sister.

111
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,160
He means...

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,160
he means

113
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't deserve it.

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,840
I don't deserve to be his cousin.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
You don't deserve him.

116
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,240
You're right.

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,960
Master has always been strict with people.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
That's not what I meant.

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
She's not my cousin.

120
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,800
She is me.

121
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,600
Cheng Ming.

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
What are you talking about?

123
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Can you stop talking?

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm telling the truth.

125
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,840
Don't talk too much.

126
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,520
What do you mean?

127
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,640
You are here.

128
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,159
I've been looking for you two.

129
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
A couple?

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,640
It's not what you think.

131
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,000
Wanwan.

132
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,560
Lin, stop it.

133
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,280
I know.

134
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,720
You are not Mr. Cheng’s cousin,

135
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,360
or your cousin.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,800
Hong Li.

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Stop explaining.

138
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,320
I heard it clearly.

139
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,880
True love is not easy.

140
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,600
Don't worry.

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,160
We won't tell anyone.

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,560
Let's go.

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,840
How did they know about us?

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,600
We...

145
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,560
The world changes so fast.

146
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm leaving.

147
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,520
Take your time.

148
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,440
Hey,

149
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Where did you buy

150
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,320
this morning?

151
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
It smells so good.

152
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,080
Steamed buns

153
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Where did you buy it? I want it too.

154
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
It's at the stall nearby

155
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,520
I went to the kitchen last night

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,960
in the kitchen last night.

157
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,880
I made it.

158
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
I asked Shrimp to deliver it today.

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:04,960
Try it.

160
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,560
What is this?

161
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,840
Can I have one?

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
You came to my room

163
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,880
in my room

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,320
and asked me what Lin likes to eat.

165
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,840
It turns out that you want to be nice.

166
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,160
This red bean cake

167
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
has always been lovesickness.

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Acacia. Acacia. Acacia.

169
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,520
We meet every day.

170
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,440
No.

171
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,880
Just for a moment.

172
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,800
A moment

173
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,240
One thought.

174
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
Okay, stop talking.

175
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
I'll eat it.

176
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,200
Is it good?

177
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes.

178
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Very delicious.

179
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:57,880
Really.

180
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Not bad

181
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,480
Master, I've arranged

182
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,080
in the capital.

183
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,800
This year's tribute cloth and tea

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
can be delivered on time.

185
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
Thank you, madam.

186
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
You always

187
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,480
is always so considerate.

188
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
The imperial physician

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,600
a few days ago.

190
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
He said

191
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
This heart disease

192
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,480
is fine now.

193
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,840
I think he's recovered.

194
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,240
Yes, Master.

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
If Qi has recovered,

196
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,360
Master and I will be relieved.

197
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,800
Madam.

198
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,320
Thank you for all these years.

199
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
Not at all.

200
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,320
As long as Qi is safe.

201
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
God is merciful.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,680
Yes.

203
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,120
God bless our family.

204
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,000
that Qi

205
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
marry a good wife

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,240
to help our family

207
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,320
and inherit the great cause.

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,760
and bring glory to our ancestors.

209
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,720
What?

210
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,000
What does Qi'er have to do with

211
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
has nothing to do with his health.

212
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,800
This...

213
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,040
Look at my mouth.

214
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
too fast.

215
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,160
What do you mean?

216
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,320
Nothing, Master.

217
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,320
Just some gossip.

218
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,640
Don't beat around the bush.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,520
What do you mean?

220
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll tell you then.

221
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,400
Recently,

222
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
in the mansion recently.

223
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,840
It is said

224
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,280
a teacher in the academy.

225
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,480
The servants

226
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,480
often see Qi

227
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
with him.

228
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,400
they were very close.

229
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,400
Sometimes they pull each other

230
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Sometimes they are ambiguous

231
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,840
The servants said

232
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,520
don't

233
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,280
talking nonsense here.

234
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,200
Say it.

235
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,080
Go on.

236
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
The servants said

237
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,280
Qi has broken sleeves.

238
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,360
The love of Longyang.

239
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
Ask Qi'er to come to me.

240
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,880
Master.

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,680
Don't listen to their gossip.

242
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,400
Master.

243
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,960
Really?

244
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,680
Let's go.

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,560
Let's go.

246
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,800
Okay.

247
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,480
I have to memorize

248
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,080
this article.

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,720
Me too.

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,680
Me too.

251
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,920
It's okay.

252
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,520
Come on.

253
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,120
Wait for me.

254
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,240
Hurry up.

255
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
What's the hurry? We still have time.

256
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,680
Let's go.

257
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,440
Why didn't you

258
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,160
stop me from talking?

259
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't you think

260
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,720
in the academy,

261
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,840
in the academy?

262
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,040
Do you think I don't deserve you?

263
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,000
There are so many people

264
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,000
in the academy.

265
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm afraid I'll be beaten to death.

266
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,680
I don't have any power now.

267
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,120
nor can I protect myself.

268
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,040
I have no power.

269
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,720
Don't you have

270
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,800
half of the Internal Dan in your body?

271
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,440
Stop asking.

272
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,120
Tell me.

273
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,400
Okay.

274
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,400
To be honest,

275
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,000
Actually,

276
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,600
I've already returned the Internal Dan to you.

277
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,920
What?

278
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,680
When did you return the Internal Dan to me?

279
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,960
How could I not know?

280
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
It’s in Panling Mountain Cave.

281
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
You fell asleep?

282
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,800
I...

283
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
I wouldn't know.

284
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,840
You kissed me secretly.

285
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,800
No.

286
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,880
I didn't kiss you secretly.

287
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm sacrificing myself for justice.

288
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
Be kind and be kind, okay?

289
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
Why are you so silly?

290
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,520
Are you really willing to

291
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,600
for me?

292
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,880
Cheng Qi.

293
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
This jade pendant...

294
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,560
Take it with you.

295
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,120
In the future,

296
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
when you see it,

297
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,600
See me.

298
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,760
Lin.

299
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't worry.

300
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
No matter what happens,

301
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
I will protect you forever.

302
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,960
I won't let you

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
hurt you.

304
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,800
I will protect you.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,520
forever.

306
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
Ever since I met you,

307
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,840
The person in my dream

308
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,920
What happened in my dream

309
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
as if I've experienced it myself.

310
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm not Lin in the dream.

311
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
but Wan Mo.

312
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,040
And you are not Cheng Qi.

313
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,120
but Ao Qi.

314
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,560
Could it be

315
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
really have a past life?

316
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Maybe it's not strange

317
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,360
It's not strange to meet in this life.

318
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
In my previous life,

319
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
Do you also believe in the past life?

320
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,400
Maybe we're destined to meet in our previous lives.

321
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,440
We meet in this life.

322
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,920
What did you say?

323
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,600
Nothing.

324
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,840
If it's that hard,

325
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
then stop thinking about it.

326
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,560
What matters is

327
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
at this moment,

328
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,800
You're by my side

329
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm by your side.

330
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,440
We're together.

331
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Why are you laughing?

332
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm laughing.

333
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,440
You're by my side.

334
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,280
Master.

335
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,000
Say it.

336
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,000
I heard that

337
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,520
in Cheng Mansion.

338
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,680
It's also said that

339
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,360
that the book is in the academy.

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,440
But the academy is complicated.

341
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,880
It can be traced.

342
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,120
I want you to spend the rest of your time

343
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
to find the book.

344
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
Otherwise,

345
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,400
you won't have much time.

346
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,680
Master.

347
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,880
Master.

348
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,840
Give me another chance.

349
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,840
I will do my best.

350
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,680
Qi.

351
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,760
Mother.

352
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Why did you

353
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
to see me?

354
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,840
Your father...

355
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,840
Greetings, Father.

356
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,200
Why are you so angry?

357
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm angry

358
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,960
because

359
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,400
you unfilial son.

360
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,840
Qi.

361
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,240
I trust you.

362
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,280
No matter what happens,

363
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
will tell us.

364
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,240
not to hide it from us.

365
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,840
Father, Mother.

366
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
What are you talking about?

367
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
I don't understand at all.

368
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,000
I know.

369
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,560
Have you been

370
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,880
with someone recently?

371
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,360
Yes.

372
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,120
What's wrong?

373
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,080
What's wrong?

374
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,520
Are you trying to piss us off?

375
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,600
So you all know.

376
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,600
Since you all know,

377
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,560
I'll be frank.

378
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,400
Father, Mother.

379
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,240
I want to get married.

380
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,400
Mother, what’s wrong?

381
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,840
Don't you like Lin?

382
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,080
Who?

383
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,960
Who?

384
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,079
You are going to marry Lin.

385
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:08,920
Lin.

386
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,800
Who is Lin?

387
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,000
Master.

388
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,720
I told you before.

389
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,200
Qi'er left in our mansion.

390
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
is

391
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,400
is a girl.

392
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,920
Yes, Master.

393
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
It's a girl.

394
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,839
Sure.

395
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,359
Just a girl.

396
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,800
If you like her,

397
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,480
you can marry her anytime.

398
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,920
Really, Father?

399
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,720
Yes.

400
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,160
But

401
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
she comes from a poor family.

402
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,520
She has no parents.

403
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
It doesn't matter.

404
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,720
We are her parents.

405
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,200
She has never been educated.

406
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,680
She doesn't know three obediences and four virtues.

407
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
She doesn't know women's etiquette.

408
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
She can learn.

409
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,440
We'll hire a teacher for her.

410
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,280
to the mansion.

411
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,160
and teach her.

412
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,200
Okay.

413
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,000
Sure.

414
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,000
By the way, Qi,

415
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,760
If you like it,

416
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,280
let's get this marriage

417
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,080
as soon as possible.

418
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,280
Thank you, father.

419
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,320
Thank you, mother.
