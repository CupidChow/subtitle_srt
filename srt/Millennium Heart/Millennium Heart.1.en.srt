1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,000
Three thousand years ago,

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,120
the Demon Lord's nightmare remained as a unifying three realms

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,000
to be immortal,

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
I broke into the Heavenly Realm

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,240
and obtained the divine memorandum.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,800
Luckily, Ao Qi of the Dragon Clan

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
and the fairy, Shamo.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,920
The two parties will have a life-and-death battle.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,720
At the critical moment,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
Ao used his dragon scale

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,320
to protect

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
who was on the verge of death.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,160
And I will die

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,120
and die together.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,400
This divine memorandum

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,000
because of this.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
Although I survived,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,880
and was reborn,

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,400
But I was ignorant and ignorant about the past.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,640
In the end,

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,760
the true dragon and the Demon Lord

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
will die together.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,039
That's how I stopped

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,680
the war between Heaven and Demon.

25
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,160
The real dragon has been doomed.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
is now in chaos.

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,600
Master.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,920
What about the fairy?

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
What about the fairy?

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,480
has broken from the Devil's Capital.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,880
the fairy

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,000
perish together.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,000
Everyone in Lincheng,

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
Brothers and sisters,

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,200
everything can be solved.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,840
All magical tools and elixirs are sold.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,080
All weapons and elixirs are sold.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,400
Come, take a look.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,759
Nanny, look.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Everything can be solved.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,440
I want this.

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,160
I want to lose weight too.

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,680
I want one to keep you safe.

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm losing weight.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,800
Thank you.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,280
The waving of gold and jade.

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Red agate earrings.

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,720
The colorful fabric made by God.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,800
A rich family.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,479
I'm going to eat you today.

51
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,520
Madam,

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,960
you look beautiful

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
and elegant.

54
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,400
Unfortunately,

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
you don't look well.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,800
Is there something

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,840
that can't be solved?

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,880
Is it because of your children?

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
for your children?

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
How did you know?

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,960
Although I can't solve your pain,

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,480
it's called Yurong Frost.

63
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,040
Every night before sleep,

64
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,960
and apply some to your face.

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
It can not only relieve anxiety,

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,640
and nourish your skin,

67
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,040
It can also cure insomnia.

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,079
For months,

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
you'll feel refreshed.

70
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,360
and make you look handsome.

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,760
This is so magical.

72
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,680
It extracted

73
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,480
the essence of hundreds of fairy herbs

74
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,840
after a hundred years.

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,200
It's very rare.

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,880
How much does it cost?

77
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,080
I can save enough money

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
I can save enough money to repair the temple.

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,520
60 taels of silver.

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,880
However,

81
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm destined to meet you.

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,960
I'll sell it for 50 taels.

83
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,760
Madam Gao.

84
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,480
Madam.

85
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,720
Madam.

86
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,960
Qi.

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Mother.

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,240
What are you

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
in your mess?

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,960
is so precious?

91
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,600
Look at you.

92
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,000
You look good.

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
How could you say that?

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,040
What?

95
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,320
Do you know me

96
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,480
or used my belongings?

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,800
You look unfamiliar.

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,680
Has the world changed?

99
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
All scholars in the world

100
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
are so arrogant.

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,600
What kind of attitude is that?

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,960
Yeah.

103
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,760
That's right.

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,640
What happened?

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Cheng is nice and handsome.

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,920
a girl.

108
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,600
You

109
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
You have a pretty face.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
You're so sharp-tongued.

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,600
I've never used your things

112
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
nor recognize you.

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
I just saw

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
that can solve everything.

115
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,640
I want to see

116
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,240
if a deity descends to the mortal world

117
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,720
can cure life and death.

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
Or the world has changed?

119
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
Even a liar is so arrogant.

120
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,680
Which eye of yours

121
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,560
see I'm a liar?

122
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,200
Of course I have two eyes.

123
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,800
I saw it.

124
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,800
the smell of medicine.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
No wonder you

126
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
so mean.

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,880
You're sick.

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,360
What?

129
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Really?

130
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,800
Are you sick?

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,080
Nonsense!

132
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,440
As a girl,

133
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,120
How can you talk nonsense?

134
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
You're wrong.

135
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
I said you're sick.

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
I was just guessing.

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,960
Could it be that

138
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,960
you really have a secret?

139
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,760
You...

140
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,960
Qi.

141
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,880
Forget it.

142
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,200
Don't be mad at her.

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,520
Young lady.

144
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
I'll take

145
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,000
I want it.

146
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,120
Mother.

147
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,520
She was lying to you.

148
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,600
Why are you still helping her?

149
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,440
Madam Gao.

150
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,920
Let's go.

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
For the sake of mother,

152
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,920
I'll let it slide.

153
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,320
Looks like we should meet again.

154
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
Greetings, Master.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,520
You're just in time.

156
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,560
Have a seat.

157
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,200
I'm

158
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
playing Go with myself.

159
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,000
But this game

160
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,960
a lot of work.

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,800
Although I can see

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,400
the situation of this whole piece,

163
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,440
But I can't simply

164
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,880
side with anyone.

165
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
It's decided.

166
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,080
I think

167
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Black is going to lose.

168
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,720
Really?

169
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,040
If I want to

170
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
to win,

171
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,200
we'll break

172
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,400
my formation.

173
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
So you mean

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,560
let the white win on purpose?

175
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,960
Lose?

176
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,880
Win.

177
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,640
So what?

178
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,000
Win

179
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,440
is also me.

180
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,120
Lose

181
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,640
It's still me.

182
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,680
Master.

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,800
What do you think I should do?

184
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,320
I've given you the answer.

185
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Everything has its own destiny.

186
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,360
Everything has its own destiny.

187
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,520
There are rules in the world.

188
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,120
Since you can see through the chess,

189
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,240
but you can't figure out the direction of the game,

190
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,960
All you can do is

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
your duty.

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Leave the rest

193
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,280
the rest.

194
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,760
Mother.

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,080
Mother.

196
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,880
Madam.

197
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,560
Mother.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,760
What's wrong?

199
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,480
Qi.

200
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,440
I've seen a doctor.

201
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm fine.

202
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
You are already like this.

203
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
How can you call it nothing serious?

204
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Mother.

205
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
Have a good rest.

206
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,640
Nanny Gao.

207
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,080
Come with me.

208
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,559
All magical weapons and elixirs are sold.

209
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,159
Young man,

210
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,799
if you need anything,

211
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,039
I...

212
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
My foot...

213
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
My foot.

214
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,400
What's wrong with my foot?

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
What's going on?

216
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,000
I served my wife today.

217
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,200
After eating,

218
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,480
I applied some Yurong cream.

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,880
This...

220
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,560
Yurong Shuang.

221
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,360
That's strange.

222
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
Where did my toothpaste

223
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,480
Where did it go?

224
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,360
Didn't I sell this just now?

225
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,520
So I wanted to help you rest early.

226
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Unexpectedly,

227
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I told you

228
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,120
is a liar.

229
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,160
What do you mean?

230
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
Why did you ask someone to ruin my reputation?

231
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,840
I know.

232
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
Open your eyes and look carefully.

233
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,600
This

234
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
is the Yurong Cream

235
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
that your wife wants.

236
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,840
Your servant took the wrong one.

237
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,640
Don't accuse a good person.

238
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,520
What?

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,440
You don't believe me?

240
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,200
If you don't believe me, I'll use it

241
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,600
in front of so many people.

242
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
Do you think I'll believe you?

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,280
No.

244
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Why are you

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,120
so unreasonable?

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,240
Back off

247
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
Step back. Step back.

248
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
What happened today

249
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,320
as a lesson for you.

250
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
If I see you

251
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,160
in the street again,

252
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,160
See you at the government.

253
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,600
Who is this arrogant kid?

254
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,800
You'll be rewarded.

255
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I know.

256
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
He is the richest man in Lincheng.

257
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,360
The eldest son of the Cheng family.

258
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,080
Cheng Qi.

259
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Thank you.

260
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,400
Cheng Qi.

261
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,600
I went out

262
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
to set up a stall.

263
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,640
Why did I meet

264
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
an arrogant scholar?

265
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
You call me a liar

266
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm a liar.

267
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
Do I look like a liar?

268
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,240
There's no such

269
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,400
in this world.

270
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Exactly.

271
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,840
In my opinion,

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
he's the liar.

273
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,560
How dare he mess up my business?

274
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
A mess?

275
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,520
Do you still have your goblin skin?

276
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,400
Yes.

277
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:28,960
Look.

278
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm glad you're here.

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,960
So,

280
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
Don't be too arrogant.

281
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Watch out for ghosts.

282
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,400
Tonight,

283
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
who slanders us tonight

284
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,800
Try it.

285
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,240
Lin.

286
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,440
Which room?

287
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,600
This one.

288
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,960
No.

289
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,280
No!

290
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
This dream again?

291
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,040
That's it?

292
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,440
I haven't started yet.

293
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,320
I don't know.

294
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,400
If I had known

295
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,160
I would've been scared.

296
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,840
I'll just beat him up.

297
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Although his soul is gone,

298
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,480
but he's still breathing.

299
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,200
Wake him up.

300
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,160
Okay.

301
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,480
Wake up.

302
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
Wake up.

303
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,760
Wake up.

304
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,640
Wake up.

305
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,160
Wake up.

306
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,840
He won't wake up.

307
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
Then there's only one way.

308
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,080
Stop pretending.

309
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,440
Still pretending?

310
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,000
It's alive.

311
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
Of course I'm alive.

312
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,720
If not, we'll kill.

313
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Is this the first time

314
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,440
kissing someone?

315
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,600
Cut the crap.

316
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:54,960
Come with me.

317
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,160
So unlucky.

318
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,200
I met a short-lived ghost.

319
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,680
I've lived for thousands of years.

320
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,840
It's the first time I've felt so wronged.

321
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,360
What should we do now?

322
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,320
Go home and sleep.

323
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:12,960
Go!

324
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,840
What's going on, Lin?

325
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
Aren't you going home to sleep?

326
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Why do I feel

327
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I have no power.

328
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,600
It's strange.

329
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,920
I feel

330
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,360
my Internal Dan is not in my body.

331
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,880
Where is he?

332
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,240
Who are you?

333
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,680
Who are you?

334
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,800
Liar!

335
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,960
You're the liar!

336
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,160
You ungrateful scholar.

337
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,560
What did you do

338
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
to steal my Internal Dan?

339
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,320
I don't know.

340
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,720
What are you talking about?

341
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
But leave my house now.

342
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,720
Otherwise,

343
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,840
I'll call for help.

344
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,640
Shrimp, Xie.

345
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,560
Succulent meat.

346
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,720
Young Master

347
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,560
Coming.

348
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,440
Give me the Internal Dan.

349
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,160
Internal Dan?

350
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
I don't know what it is.

351
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,400
Fine. You won't admit it, right?

352
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,280
My Internal Dan.

353
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,440
is in your body.

354
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,800
If you don't admit it,

355
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,680
don't blame me for being rude to you.

356
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,440
What are you doing?

357
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,560
What are you doing?

358
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
Shameless!

359
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,040
You two

360
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,920
in the middle of the night

361
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,160
and strip my clothes.

362
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,800
How dare you call me shameless?

363
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,839
I saved your life,

364
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,319
but you stole my Internal Dan.

365
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Give me back my Internal Dan.

366
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,560
Okay.

368
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,440
My Internal Dan is really in your body.

369
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,079
Why?

370
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
How would I know?

371
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Mr. Cheng, to be honest,

372
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
you died of heart disease.

373
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,240
I saved you in time.

374
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,320
When I saved you,

375
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
my Internal Dan accidentally fell into

376
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,240
into your energy field.

377
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,120
is the white light

378
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,880
you see now.

379
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,560
So now,

380
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,440
please return the Internal Dan

381
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,120
right now.

382
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
What is the Internal Dan?

383
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Internal Dan?

384
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,200
belongs to us demons.

385
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
It doesn't belong to you mortals.

386
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,560
Demon!

387
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,200
How dare you hurt me!

388
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,560
By the way,

389
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,400
let me remind you again.

390
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
The Internal Dan is useful

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
for us demons.

392
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,960
But for you people,

393
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,760
is scarier than poison.

394
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Once it

395
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,040
flow into your body,

396
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,280
the poison will slowly

397
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
into your body

398
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
until your organs

399
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
and died suddenly.

400
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,080
Tell me.

401
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,360
How can I

402
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,960
take it out?

403
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,240
You just need to pass the breath to me

404
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,680
you can return it to me.

405
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,720
Does that mean

406
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,000
kiss you?

407
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,720
Impossible.

408
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,520
No way.

409
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,880
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

410
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,320
When you were unconscious,

411
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,440
when you were unconscious just now.

412
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,360
I didn't care.

413
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,360
What do you care about now?

414
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
You're so troublesome.
