1
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,520
Lin.

2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,280
Lin.

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,120
Oh no.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
I'm stunned.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
She's fine.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,960
How could a demon

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,840
be tortured

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,080
by love?

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,880
I should have

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,800
I shouldn't have let you

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,560
to set up a stall.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,640
Then I wouldn’t have met Mr. Cheng.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,760
It’s too late to say anything.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,880
I wanted to help him.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,360
Why did I hurt him instead?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,920
What happened?

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,560
Lin,

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,640
Although you don't admit it,

19
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,840
I know

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
you have Mr. Cheng in your heart.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,800
I’m 100% sure.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,039
I...

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm just...

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
feel guilty.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,360
Besides,

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,680
we are both demons.

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,120
How can you understand love in the mortal world?

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,920
I don't understand.

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,920
I know more than you do.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,360
Let me ask you.

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,880
would you unconsciously

33
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,840
think of Mr. Cheng?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,280
Okay, let me ask you again.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
When you and Mr. Cheng

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,160
are together,

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,400
When you talk about something interesting,

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,400
when you smile,

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
when you smile?

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,000
Try to recall

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,880
When you get close to Mr. Cheng,

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
when you get close to Mr. Cheng?

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,520
Your face is still hot.

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Isn't it done?

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,320
What do you mean?

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
It's all a coincidence, okay?

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
No one knows what's going on.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,160
Believe it or not.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat.

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,560
Wait.

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
How do you know this?

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
The storyteller's romance novels

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,960
is written like this.

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,880
Really?

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Forget it.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,200
I can't explain it to you.

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,760
Lin.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,600
How is he?

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,560
I know.

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,440
you're not mad at him.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,640
You're worried about him.

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
It's all my fault.

63
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
If I hadn't

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,400
forcing him to get my Internal Dan,

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
he wouldn't have taken the risk.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,760
Lin,

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,320
You don’t know about this.

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
You shouldn't blame yourself.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,079
Why not?

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,760
I was too selfish.

71
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
I only thought about my Internal Dan.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't care

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
care about his life.

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
It's not what you think.

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Even if you stopped it,

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,399
Cheng Qi would insist on doing it.

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,120
Besides,

78
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,320
as long as you work together,

79
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,960
you can save him.

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
I can save him.

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
How can I save him?

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,520
How can I save him?

83
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,440
Lin.

84
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,040
Are you sure?

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,520
Cheng Qi

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,880
for me.

87
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm just an Internal Dan.

88
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,400
I want him to live well.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Okay.

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,000
If you want to return the Internal Dan to Cheng Qi,

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,360
It's simple.

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Think about it.

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,760
how the Internal Dan

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,640
enter his body?

95
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,200
Young Master.

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,720
How is it?

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
There's news from Cheng Qi.

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,880
God is on my side.

99
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,960
God is on my side.

100
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,440
No.

101
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:41,840
No.

102
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
I have to go check.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,000
Young Master!

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,560
My brother.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
Why did you die so young?

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,159
My brother.

107
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,840
What's wrong?

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,200
My brother, Madam.

109
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Brother!

110
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,120
Father, Di.

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,960
This...

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,640
Don't be too sad.

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
I will

114
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
take good care of you

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
and inherit the Cheng family’s business.

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,200
Even if my brother is gone,

117
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Di.

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,000
You still have me, Father.

119
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,640
What are you

120
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
What are you talking about?

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Get lost, you bastard!

122
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,080
Di.

123
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,040
What are you talking about?

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,760
Master.

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:29,960
Cheng Qi.

126
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,640
Qi.

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Father, Mother.

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,520
Mother.

129
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,040
You...

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
Qi is fine now.

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,200
I came here

132
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
because I didn't want you to worry.

133
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,040
You...

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
Aren't you dead?

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,880
Di.

136
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,920
How dare you!

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
Your brother

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
standing in front of you.

139
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,560
How dare you curse him?

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Dad, look at

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
on your head.

142
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Get lost.

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,200
It's a misunderstanding.

144
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,760
Get lost!

145
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,200
It's a misunderstanding.

146
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,640
Get out!

147
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,400
Get out!

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
Master! Master!

149
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,800
Di must have

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,880
believed some false words.

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,120
How did you teach your son?

152
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Get out of here!

153
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Yes.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
It's my Qi.

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,680
Bastard!

156
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,000
I managed to escape this.

157
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,600
If you curse my son again,

158
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,080
I won't forgive you.

159
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,080
It’s fine.

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,480
I can tell you

161
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,000
from Cheng Di.

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,920
I don't find it strange at all.

163
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,040
Why did you lie to me?

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:26,920
Young Master!

165
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
Young Master, you're finally back.

166
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
I haven't finished my words.

167
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Yesterday Cheng Qi

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,360
was unconscious.

169
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,400
Somehow,

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,840
I'm energetic again today.

171
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,440
Please calm down, Young Master.

172
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,200
But I heard

173
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,280
I heard another news.

174
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,920
Are you telling the truth?

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
Yes, Young Master.

176
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,600
Are you sure?

177
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,800
I swear with my life.

178
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
I’m sure this time.

179
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
I see.

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,159
Cheng Qi.

181
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,400
Let's wait and see.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
What is this place?

183
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
It's so spiritual.

184
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
This is the Playing Spirit.

185
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,800
isolated from the world.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
You can rest here.

187
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,880
In three days,

188
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
in three days.

189
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,039
Look.

190
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,400
Look at that cloud.

191
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,520
Does it look like a dragon?

192
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,920
Shamo.

193
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,120
Ao Qi, why did you call me?

194
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,680
Live well.

195
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,200
Cheng Qi.

196
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,480
Why did you call me?

197
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,560
Nothing.

198
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,360
Let's go there.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,240
Let's go.

200
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,920
Greetings, Master.

201
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
How are they?

202
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,440
I used Yuli's finger blood

203
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,960
with Yuli's blood.

204
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,280
and took him and Lin

205
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,640
to recuperate in the Playing Spirit.

206
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
I hope Cheng Qi can

207
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,240
to regain his consciousness

208
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,240
and escape this.

209
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,400
Master.

210
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
I have another question.

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,520
Go ahead.

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
If the Internal Dan in Lin's body

213
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
belongs to Cheng Qi,

214
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
What will happen to Lin?

215
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,760
The Internal Dan of Lin

216
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,880
can't be returned.

217
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
Once Cheng Qi's Internal Dan is back,

218
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
she will eventually become a mortal.

219
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
and will not be able to escape.

220
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
Their previous lives

221
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,240
is related to this life.

222
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,320
As for whether they can continue,

223
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,840
it depends on their fate.

224
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,720
Look.

225
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,120
There are so many fish here.

226
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Do you want to eat grilled fish?

227
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,080
Yes.

228
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,840
Wait for me.

229
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,120
You?

230
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,160
You can catch fish?

231
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,280
What do you mean?

232
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Don't underestimate me.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,520
Watch me!

234
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,280
Come up.

235
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Fishing

236
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,840
to catch fish.

237
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
Got it.

238
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Me too.

239
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
Your fish is too small.

240
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,560
Mine is bigger than yours.

241
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,600
Mine is bigger than yours.

242
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Mine is bigger than yours.

243
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
No.

244
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,360
Mine is bigger.

245
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,840
Why are you looking at me?

246
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Your body

247
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,960
There's nothing to see.

248
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
What do you mean?

249
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,800
What do you mean by my figure?

250
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,040
Nothing to see.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,160
What are you doing?

252
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,840
Miss Fairy.

253
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,160
Is that you?

254
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,880
Miss Fairy.

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,960
You are that little boy.

256
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
It's really you.

257
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,680
I didn't expect

258
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,400
I was fooled twice by you.

259
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Have you been blaming me?

260
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,040
Why would I blame you?

261
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
I remember

262
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,480
I went to the jungle alone.

263
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,560
and ran into a venomous snake.

264
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,320
Luckily, you arrived in time

265
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,040
and saved me.

266
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
and sent me home.

267
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,400
Maybe it was because

268
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
I was too young.

269
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,880
That's why you don't remember.

270
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,320
Shrimp.

271
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
Come out.

272
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm scared.

273
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Shrimp

274
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,800
Shrimp

275
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Come out.

276
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,680
I'm scared.

277
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,840
Shrimp

278
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Shrimp

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
If you don't come out,

280
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,640
I'll ask my father to beat you.

281
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Shrimp.

282
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
Shrimp

283
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,720
Snake.

284
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,320
Snake!

285
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
Snake!

286
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,000
Snake.

287
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,240
Here.

288
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,920
Kid, don't be afraid.

289
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
The snake has been caught

290
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,240
by my sister.

291
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,680
Why are you here alone?

292
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,840
I brought my servants here.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,880
but I got lost in the mountain.

294
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,080
Okay, stop crying.

295
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,320
Where is your home?

296
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,400
Lincheng.

297
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,560
Lincheng.

298
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,200
I'll take you home.

299
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,560
Here.

300
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,480
I remember

301
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,360
I was standing in front of my house

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,480
and held you tight.

303
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Because I know

304
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,880
you are an immortal.

305
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,680
I want you

306
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
to cure my heart disease.

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,520
In the end,

308
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,160
I didn't expect

309
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,440
for more than 20 years.

310
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,520
I never saw you again.

311
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,880
I once thought

312
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,040
this might be a dream

313
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,560
in my childhood.

314
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
Because I've thought too much.

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,160
I want to be like other kids

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,200
like other kids.

317
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,480
and play outside.

318
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,360
And I'm not just

319
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,040
watching.

320
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't want

321
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,800
every time

322
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,320
shouted at my door

323
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
saying I was a sick man.

324
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,360
But I didn't expect

325
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,600
everything was so real.

326
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
Okay, you're home.

327
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,760
I'm leaving.

328
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
Are you a fairy?

329
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,880
You're an immortal, right?

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,160
Can you cure my heart disease?

331
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,160
Please.

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,160
Okay.

333
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,359
I promise you.

334
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
But you have to wait for me.

335
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,280
You have to go far

336
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,599
to collect the Deity Herb.

337
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,839
You must come back.

338
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,760
Miss Fairy,

339
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,079
I'll wait for you.

340
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
By the way, my name is Cheng Qi.

341
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,119
Okay, I'll remember.

342
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,200
Miss Fairy.

343
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,720
Please come back.

344
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,720
Go back.

345
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
You must come back.

346
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,800
Young Master.

347
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,480
Why are you here?

348
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,440
Let's go in.

349
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,840
Miss Fairy,

350
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,600
Have you found the Deity Herb?

351
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,160
When are you coming?

352
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm looking forward to it.

353
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,120
People are good in nature.

354
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,800
We have similar nature and learn to be far apart.

355
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
If you don't teach, your nature will change.

356
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
The water breeze is light

357
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,520
Apples grow old

358
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,600
The moon dew is cold.

359
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
The leaves are yellow.

360
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,840
[To heal my love.]

361
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Where is the old friend?

362
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,000
The smoke is vast.

363
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Miss Fairy,

364
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,560
It's been so many years.

365
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,440
when will you come to me?

366
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,640
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
It's all my fault.

368
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,400
I really wanted to help you.

369
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,560
But...

370
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,760
It's just that

371
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
not enough.

372
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,720
It's okay.

373
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,200
It's good that you're back now.

374
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:29,920
7OPWORKS
