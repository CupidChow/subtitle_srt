1
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,440
When you were unconscious,

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,560
when you were unconscious just now.

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,400
I didn't care.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
What do you care about now?

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,240
You are so troublesome.

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,720
Lin.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,840
How is it?

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,920
Is he out?

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,120
I...

10
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,720
I tried my best.

11
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,760
What's wrong?

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,360
Your Internal Dan

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,000
is working in my body.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,039
Otherwise,

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
why would I

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
chest tightness and shortness of breath.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,200
I feel so bad.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,360
No way.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,440
My Internal Dan

20
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
is the spiritual object I've cultivated for a thousand years.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,920
It's good for nothing.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,520
Even a mortal can eat it.

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Why do you feel so sad?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,560
You lied to me again.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
I'll tease you.

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
No, no.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,800
Are you okay?

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,560
What's wrong?

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,840
Wake up.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,880
You must be fine.

31
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,640
If anything happens to you,

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
I don't have Internal Dan to save you.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
Wake up.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
He's still breathing.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,120
We can only wait until he wakes up tomorrow

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,000
when he wakes up tomorrow.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
Why am I so unlucky?

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,600
Why am I so easily fooled

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,440
This is so easy to be fooled.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
How dare you call yourself a demon?

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,520
Wake up.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,600
Have you figured out a way?

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
If I can,

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
am I still here?

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,520
Are you not going to leave

46
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,480
you won't leave, right?

47
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,440
I have to wait until

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
return the Internal Dan to me.

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,120
You're dirty.

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,320
Go take a shower

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,120
and get changed.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
Why should I do it when you tell me to?

53
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,680
Besides,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,079
I didn't bring any clothes to change.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,680
Only after I wash them

56
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,200
can you talk to me.

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,440
Besides,

58
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,280
I need some clothes

59
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,079
of servants.

60
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,840
What do you mean?

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,480
A servant?

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,960
I...

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,440
Have you heard?

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,480
There was a woman

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,320
a woman

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
woke up together this morning.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,560
What?

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,880
Young Master slept with a woman.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,440
Really?

70
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,280
Who told you that?

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
It doesn't matter.

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,480
As we all know,

73
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,240
for a long time.

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,080
Really?

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes.

76
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe the Cheng family will have more children.

77
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
Who knows?

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,320
Maybe

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,360
this woman wants to enter the house.

80
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,320
Put up a notice right now.

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
Be sure to reward him.

82
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,519
We must find

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,320
who can catch demons.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Catch...

85
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,480
Hunting... Hunting demons?

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,080
Yes.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Go.

88
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,240
Okay.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes.

90
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,160
Let's go.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
What?

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,640
Are you lost?

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,280
This is a forbidden place in the fairy realm.

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,240
How did you get in?

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll take you out.

96
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,480
Don't bother.

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,440
Just tell me

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
how to get out here.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
I can walk by myself.

100
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,960
Such a beautiful hand.

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
Why did you hide it?

102
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,560
What’s your name?

103
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,720
Yuli.

104
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,000
Yuli.

105
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,880
My Lord.

106
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,960
You must wake up.

107
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Waiter, a pot of tea.

108
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,520
Okay.

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,000
Someone unveiled the ranking.

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,200
Hey.

111
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
It's been a morning.

112
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
No one can unveil the ranking.

113
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,760
Let's go back.

114
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,320
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
What if those two demons change

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
and harm Eldest Young Master?

117
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
A brave man will be rewarded.

118
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,320
Haven't you heard of it?

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,560
Stay here.

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,520
I'll do it again.

121
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,760
Yes.

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,760
Knock.

123
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,640
Please lead the way.

124
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
So cute.

125
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,200
Good boy.

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Thank you.

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,320
It's been three thousand years

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
to be reincarnated.

129
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,400
His soul is still weak.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
But now he has

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,560
in his heart.

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,200
was absorbed

133
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,960
by his mortal body.

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,440
Sir,

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,200
did you see anything?

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,160
If I'm not mistaken,

137
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,880
this lady

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
is not a mortal, right?

139
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,760
Your Internal Dan

140
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,880
should be in this young master's body.

141
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

142
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
Can you tell me

143
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,280
how I should retrieve my Internal Dan?

144
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,960
Since the Internal Dan has entered

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,760
in your body,

146
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,880
It means the Internal Dan is fated to be with you.

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,960
Besides,

148
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,560
seems to have a heart disease.

149
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,200
The Internal Dan has protected him.

150
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,720
I sensed the Internal Dan.

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,720
has entered

152
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,559
your meridians

153
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,679
is repairing your body.

154
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,080
So...

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,360
the Internal Dan

156
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
can't be taken back for now.

157
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,679
What?

158
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
Her Internal Dan

159
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
is repairing my body.

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
What should I do now?

161
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,600
Now,

162
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,800
it depends on fate.

163
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
Fate?

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
So you mean

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,520
I have to wait until

166
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,560
fully recovered.

167
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,280
You're destined to meet him.

168
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,840
Please don't worry.

169
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,960
The Internal Dan

170
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,640
is repairing your body,

171
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,800
but it's not damaged.

172
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Just wait for the right time

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,440
I can help you

174
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,480
return the Internal Dan.

175
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
Due to the guidance of the Internal Dan,

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
you may have some connection

177
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
with your senses.

178
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,520
So for the time being,

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
you two can't be separated.

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,080
What?

181
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,200
We can't be apart.

182
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,840
What if fate doesn't come?

183
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,640
he won't recover.

184
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,040
he won't be able to get the Internal Dan back.

185
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
That's right.

186
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
Why didn't I think of that?

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,080
Then I'll

188
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,720
to cultivate alchemy.

189
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,560
A living person?

190
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,160
Yes.

191
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,080
Kill him.

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,640
That's right.

193
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
It's like killing a chicken to extract an egg.

194
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,800
Then chop him into pieces

195
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
Marinate it

196
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,760
Enough.

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
One said he wanted to cut you open and get the elixir.

198
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,960
and said he would cut you into pieces to eat meat.

199
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,760
and drink your blood.

200
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,440
and stew your bones into soup.

201
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
These two demons

202
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,560
are really ruthless.

203
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,680
If it weren't for me,

204
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm afraid the living things

205
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,440
have been eaten by them.

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
That's right.

207
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,640
We can't keep them.

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,920
Otherwise,

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,880
do something.

210
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,840
I'll stall them for a few days.

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,480
Go to the city

212
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,080
and find the most famous sorcerer

213
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,800
to see if there is any way

214
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,200
to subdue them.

215
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,120
Okay.

216
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,840
I'll be right there.

217
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Please wait here.

218
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,560
I'll get the master.

219
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,080
Thank you.

220
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
What's the matter?

221
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,080
Are you Master Yuli?

222
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,520
Is your young master

223
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
by some demon?

224
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
by some demon?

225
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,040
No.

226
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,560
I didn't say anything.

227
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,320
How did you know?

228
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,800
Master.

229
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,000
Master!

230
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Master!

231
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,000
I finally found the right person.

232
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,680
Do you have

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,440
to break it?

234
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,320
Don't worry.

235
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
Money is not a problem.

236
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,080
That's right.

237
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,120
It's her.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Master.

239
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,680
please

240
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
save my young master.

241
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
This is a demon hunter bell.

242
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,800
As long as you tie it

243
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,160
on that demon,

244
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,920
it can weaken her energy.

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
When her energy is gone,

246
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,280
I can subdue her.

247
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,240
You must keep it well.

248
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,640
and return it to me.

249
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you, Master Yuli.

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,240
Master.

251
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,120
I finally made it.

252
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,840
I’m back.

253
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,600
Yuli.
