1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,306
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,397
203 METER HILL

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,065
I'm

5
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,651
Immortal Sugimoto!

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,284
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

8
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,412
<i>With the help of Asirpa,</i>
<i>a young Ainu girl,</i>

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>and Shiraishi, an escaped convict,</i>
<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,543
We will find the gold.

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,672
I know about what happened
in Abashiri Prison.

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,174
Noppera-Bo

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,259
is Asirpa's father.

15
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,678
I'm going to meet Noppera-Bo.

16
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,182
I want to see with my own eyes
whether Noppera-Bo is Aca.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>Hijikata's group, led by</i>
<i>Toshizo Hijikata, one of the escapees.</i>

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Lieutenant Tsurumi.</i>

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>The two factions join the hunt,</i>
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,823
I want to make fake tattooed skins.

21
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,161
They probably used these six bodies
to make fake tattooed skins.

22
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,664
We will throw the tattoo hunt into chaos!

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,458
Is this real or fake?

24
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,543
We need a way to tell them apart.

25
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,837
I know someone who can help us.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,881
A man called Choan Kumagishi.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,802
<i>Sugimoto's group has six tattoos.</i>

28
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,055
<i>Hijikata's group has six.</i>

29
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,601
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Tsurumi, has two.</i>

30
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,312
<i>Twelve tattoos left.</i>

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:50,151
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of their grueling journey</i>

32
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>to be the first to collect all 24 tattoos</i>

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,158
<i>and find the hidden trove of Ainu gold.</i>

34
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,210
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

35
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,016
How long has this bear been like this?

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,935
AINU KOTAN NEAR KABATO

37
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,604
The cub grew faster than expected.

38
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,774
We're making a bigger cage for it.

39
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,067
Don't worry.

40
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,195
I'm Ekurok.

41
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,576
You should ask Retanno Ekasi, my father
and village chief, if you can stay here.

42
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,983
There are rules to follow
when visiting an Ainu house.

43
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,486
I've done it a few times. Watch and learn.

44
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,665
First, clear your throat loudly.

45
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,793
Don't call out to the people inside.

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,846
He went back in.

47
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:47,852
The younger family members check who it is
and report it to the head of the house.

48
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,691
If we're permitted to enter,
they'll start cleaning the house.

49
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,706
This ant is huge.

50
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,878
How long is this going to take?

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,341
Some years ago,
a Japanese government official

52
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,262
toured the inner parts of Hokkaido
with an Ainu guide.

53
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,974
It rained heavily,
so they sought shelter in an Ainu house.

54
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,143
But the Ainu
insisted on cleaning the house.

55
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,230
By the time they were done,
the rain had let up.

56
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,695
Please come in.

57
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,911
Now we hold hands.

58
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,038
-We enter holding hands?
-Yeah.

59
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,754
Bend your back.

60
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,259
It's basic etiquette to stoop
as you enter their house holding hands.

61
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,615
Do as he does.

62
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,493
Like this?

63
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,832
Hello.

64
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,755
<i>Musonkami</i>.

65
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,299
Huh? What?

66
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,687
Why is that girl traveling with you?

67
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,147
Well,

68
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,067
we hired her as a guide.

69
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,153
She shows us Ainu villages
in which to stay.

70
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,197
I see.

71
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,408
Let me introduce my family.

72
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,662
That's my wife, Monoa.

73
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,832
This is my brother--

74
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,459
-I gotta go <i>osoma</i>.
-What?

75
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,212
Seriously, Asirpa? Can't you hold it?

76
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,048
My <i>osoma </i>is almost at the exit.

77
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,926
Manners, young lady!

78
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,512
Sorry.

79
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,140
She's not usually like this.
I wonder what's gotten into her?

80
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,810
I don't mind.

81
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,814
Our toilet may be difficult to find.

82
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,566
Make sure she doesn't get lost.

83
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,801
They're feeding it such awful food.

84
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,274
EPISODE 8: SILENT KOTAN

85
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,827
What did Asirpa mean
when she said "<i>musonkami</i>"?

86
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,081
What's this?

87
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,084
You don't know what it means?

88
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,967
What's with the girl?

89
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,679
Watch her, Kumagishi.

90
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,482
Why do you pretend to be Ainu?

91
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,071
I've never heard of <i>musonkami</i>.

92
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,950
Is that girl from a <i>kotan </i>around here?

93
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,578
We have different dialects.

94
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,662
That makes sense.

95
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,166
What's with the attitude, Ogata?

96
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,502
-Don't be rude to them.
-These guys…

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,589
Are they really Ainu?

98
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,100
<i>Musonkami </i>is what we say

99
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:43,481
to mock those whose hands move like
restless flies during the <i>onkami </i>greeting.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,568
But they didn't know what it meant.

101
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,949
<i>I deliberately kept my headband on,</i>
<i>but no one told me off.</i>

102
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,160
<i>Not to mention the bear in the cage.</i>

103
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,329
<i>How dare they feed it such garbage.</i>

104
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>We give the bears we raise</i>

105
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,961
food that is as good as
or better than what we eat.

106
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,964
Then we sacrifice them

107
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,634
so they'll tell the gods
our <i>kotan </i>treated them well.

108
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,971
These people couldn't perform the ritual.

109
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,473
Now the bear's too big.

110
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,938
Why are you guys pretending to be Ainu?

111
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,234
They'll kill you
if they hear you say that.

112
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,365
Many travelers have visited this village,
but do you know how many left alive?

113
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,866
Not a single one.

114
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,705
The men get the travelers drunk
and kill them in their sleep.

115
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,165
Why?

116
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:51,173
These men are convicts
who escaped from Kabato Prison.

117
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,969
They're using this village
as their hideout.

118
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,725
We were all broken out of prison
by the same man.

119
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:06,606
He showed up at Kabato Prison
disguised as… a high-ranking official

120
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,774
and helped us escape.

121
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,110
After that,

122
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:16,157
he imprisoned me here
and forced me to make counterfeit money.

123
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,284
"Counterfeit money"?

124
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,330
His real name is Kiyohiro Suzukawa,

125
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,375
a master con artist
who can make himself look like anyone.

126
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,837
Now he's pretending to be
the village chief.

127
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:35,468
I heard he's a convict
who escaped from Abashiri Prison.

128
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,844
Abashiri Prison?

129
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,182
They forced the village women
to pose as their family.

130
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,852
I'll help you escape.
Get someone who can help us.

131
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,815
That man who escaped from Abashiri Prison,

132
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,984
does he have a strange tattoo?

133
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,079
What did she say?

134
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,707
Oh, don't mind her.

135
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:12,296
Some villagers don't like ethnic Japanese.
But not us. We welcome you.

136
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,423
Let us drink tonight--

137
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,383
We…

138
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,385
we need your help!

139
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,304
Get out!

140
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,107
Did we offend your wife?

141
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,442
I'm sorry if we were rude.

142
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,819
Not at all.

143
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,488
Something isn't right.

144
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,240
Not that again, Ogata.

145
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,288
Let's prove it to him.

146
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,375
Every Ainu knows how to use this.

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,045
<i>-What's that weird stick?</i>
<i>-What's that weird stick?</i>

148
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,215
Ushiyama, you go first.

149
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,550
Me?

150
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,843
Why me?

151
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,563
I'm a widow.

152
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,400
I lost my husband in the war,
and now I'm all alone.

153
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,988
But… my body yearns to be touched.

154
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,534
Thanks to this, I can satisfy myself.

155
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,290
Scratch that itch--

156
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,458
Wrong!

157
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,168
Okay, next.

158
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,128
Retanno Ekasi.

159
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,631
You understand

160
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,384
what we expect from you, right?

161
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,268
Hurry up, gramps.

162
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,211
Oh, I know.
You're putting on your favorite clothes.

163
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,466
You fixed your hair.

164
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,219
You're going out.

165
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,730
You're… warding off evil and…

166
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,320
Huh? You're tired, and your back hurts?

167
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,874
You can use it that way?

168
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,835
<i>Did I get it right?</i>

169
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,921
Enough.

170
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,133
I'll show you the correct way to use it.

171
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,218
Give it here.

172
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,972
You sure you know how to use it?

173
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,977
That hurt!

174
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,065
You can speak Japanese?

175
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,319
So? Plenty of Ainu know Japanese.

176
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,780
-You okay?
<i>-He's so nice.</i>

177
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,282
How could you, Ogata?

178
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:32,204
I doubt a real Ainu
would reflexively shout in Japanese.

179
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,835
Why would these people pretend to be Ainu?

180
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,379
Cut it out, Ogata.

181
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,634
Hey… where's Asirpa?

182
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,890
Oh, um…

183
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,935
One of the women is teaching her
how to embroider. She loves it.

184
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,063
Kids shouldn't have to watch adults argue.

185
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,275
Asirpa enjoys embroidering?

186
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,404
You bastard.

187
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,615
Where's Asirpa?

188
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,075
Hey, look at his legs.

189
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,660
A yakuza tattoo.

190
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,204
Yakuza pretending to be Ainu.

191
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,173
It's the long-eared monster.

192
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,967
Where'd you take Asirpa?!

193
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,098
All the men here are vicious convicts
from Kabato Prison.

194
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,769
I can't stop them. I'm so sorry.

195
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,770
Don't be.

196
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,315
The convicts are the ones
who will be sorry.

197
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,363
My friends will slit the girl's throat
as soon as I give the order!

198
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,948
Drop your weapons!

199
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,577
<i>Is that how you use it?</i>

200
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,164
Let's see you give that order.

201
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,962
How do you beg for your life in Ainu?

202
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,136
Keep an eye on your gun,
Private First Class.

203
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,834
Asirpa!

204
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,129
Sugimoto is calling me.

205
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,630
Wait! There's a guard!

206
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,010
What's this? Are you letting her escape?

207
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:51,927
No, I…

208
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,063
This is for killing my husband!

209
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,148
Kill them all!

210
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,461
I don't like you either, Sugimoto.

211
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,463
Asirpa.

212
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,934
Die!

213
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,103
Huh?

214
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,449
Oops.

215
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,913
It's chaos out there.
This is our chance to run.

216
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,667
We'll get caught in the crossfire.
We can't let you get hurt.

217
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,589
You're Choan Kumagishi,
the counterfeiter, right?

218
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,425
You've heard of me?

219
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,302
We need your help.

220
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,765
We need to identify
fake tattooed skins made by a taxidermist.

221
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,920
We were on our way to Kabato to see you.

222
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,132
I never wanted to be a counterfeiter!

223
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,593
I only became one because they told me to.

224
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,013
I couldn't make it as an artist.

225
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,768
But perhaps my experience

226
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,523
can answer what you want to know.

227
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,777
Asirpa! Thank God you're safe.

228
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,070
Is he with you?

229
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,448
Stop, Sugimoto. He's Choan Kumagishi.

230
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,659
Kumagishi? Why is he--

231
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,912
Damn, I missed.

232
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,584
Let me see. Is it poisoned?

233
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,255
It's poisoned.

234
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,466
The tip is still in your stomach.

235
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,346
There's no way to remove the poison
if it's in your stomach.

236
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,063
It hurts!

237
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,488
So the village chief
is an Abashiri escapee.

238
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,574
Help me!

239
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,786
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
KIYOHIRO SUZUKAWA

240
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,914
Listen up, bear.

241
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,707
Get off the geezer.

242
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,377
We need his tattoo intact, you hear me?

243
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,224
<i>A shoulder throw?</i>

244
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,812
<i>He won.</i>

245
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,156
Tell the other bears about…

246
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,535
the legend of Ushiyama the Undefeated.

247
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,343
He's wonderful.

248
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,679
-So cool.
-I think I'm in love.

249
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,931
Stand back.

250
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,724
He's so dreamy.

251
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,142
What a hunk.

252
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,561
A taxidermist?

253
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,357
Something his creations have in common?

254
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,027
Yeah. Any ideas?

255
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,240
Maybe he was like me.

256
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,912
I had certain non-negotiable rules
when making counterfeits.

257
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,708
I was obsessed

258
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,462
with surpassing the real thing.

259
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,341
For example,

260
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,972
I used materials
that were even better than the original.

261
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,269
I turned to counterfeiting
because I was poor

262
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,148
but stayed true to my artistic spirit.

263
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,694
I kept my last shred of dignity.

264
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,537
I wanted to make real art.

265
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,042
If I could have done that,

266
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,837
I wouldn't have wasted my time
making counterfeits.

267
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,551
I wanted to make something real,

268
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,972
art capable of changing the lives

269
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,018
of those… who look upon it.

270
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,090
Gotta hand it to Sugimoto.

271
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,302
He killed most of the fake Ainu himself.

272
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,430
I wouldn't want to cross him.

273
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,440
Asirpa, are you okay?

274
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,903
Did they hurt you?

275
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,323
Promise me one thing.

276
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,287
Don't kill anyone.

277
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,931
TSUKIGATA

278
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,480
I checked the other inns.

279
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,734
It looks like Sugimoto's group
hasn't arrived yet.

280
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,863
What about Kabato Prison?

281
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,032
It seems Kumagishi escaped from there.

282
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:16,496
Apparently, there was a mass breakout.
All the escapees are still on the loose.

283
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,418
In any case,
it's a good thing we went to Yubari.

284
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,672
Now we know
there may be fake skins out there.

285
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,676
I bet the lieutenant
thought we'd never find out.

286
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,138
If we can't tell the skins apart,

287
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,432
he still has the upper hand.

288
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:41,188
Even if we collect all the tattooed skins,

289
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,983
if we don't know which ones are fake,

290
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,861
we can't decipher the code.

291
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,989
What's our plan
if we can't tell the skins apart?

292
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,200
As much as it pains me to say it,

293
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,996
we'll have to rely on him
to get us a meeting with Noppera-Bo.

294
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,582
Who, me?

295
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,130
We have to depend on that useless idiot?

296
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,618
Who would've thought
we'd find Choan Kumagishi in this <i>kotan</i>?

297
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,916
Hijikata's group must've realized
Kumagishi isn't in Kabato Prison by now.

298
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,379
They'll be shocked to learn we buried him.

299
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,675
We lost him but found a new tattoo.

300
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,761
I guess that's a silver lining.

301
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,078
Don't move.

302
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,329
Huh?

303
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,456
But my wounds--

304
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,083
Deal with it.

305
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,061
We should forget…

306
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,356
what we did today.

307
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,944
We'll get in trouble…
if anyone hears of this.

308
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,163
<i>It is unclear when it happened,</i>

309
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:09,085
<i>but escaped convicts may have posed</i>
<i>as Ainu and hid in a </i>kotan <i>in the past.</i>

310
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,255
<i>Rumors of this persist around Lake Akan.</i>

311
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,056
It's safe to come out now.

312
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,228
Everything's fine now.

313
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,528
The women want to express their thanks.

314
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,655
It's <i>turep </i>season.

315
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,491
They want to make <i>turep </i>dishes for us.

316
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,659
<i>Turep</i>?

317
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,744
Giant heartleaf lily.

318
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,666
We call this time of year
"the month with few <i>turep</i>"

319
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,127
or "the month with many <i>turep</i>."

320
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,005
The lilies are <i>haruikkew</i>,
the "backbone of ingredients."

321
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,882
That's how important they are.

322
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,263
Go away!

323
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,522
Help yourself.

324
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,317
We make liquid starch from <i>turep </i>bulbs.

325
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,865
The starch goes into <i>yobusumasou </i>stems,
which are then grilled to make these.

326
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,082
Thank you.

327
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,417
Like starch noodles.

328
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,427
It's so good.
You can taste the <i>yobusumasou</i>.

329
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,262
<i>Hinna</i>.

330
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,481
What's the red stuff?

331
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,649
It's masu salmon <i>cipor</i>.

332
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,610
Crushed salmon roe.

333
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,613
We also eat it with bear fat.

334
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,630
The savory roe sauce
complements the sweet dumplings.

335
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,089
It's very <i>hinna</i>.

336
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,925
Yes, it's delicious.

337
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,136
It's <i>hinna</i>.

338
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,349
Asirpa, the roe sauce is nice,

339
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,352
but I bet it tastes great with miso.

340
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,952
Your <i>osoma </i>tastes great with everything.

341
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,120
<i>Osoma</i>?

342
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,455
<i>Osoma</i>…

343
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,873
<i>Osoma</i>?

344
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,791
<i>Osoma</i>.

345
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,501
<i>Osoma</i>?

346
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,794
Look what you've done.

347
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,963
Everyone thinks we're eating poop.

348
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,179
This is edible <i>osoma</i>.

349
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,168
It's good.

350
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,546
Really?

351
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,464
It's tasty.

352
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,899
<i>Keraan humi</i>.

353
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,693
<i>Keraan humi</i>. Delicious.

354
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,575
<i>Osoma</i>.

355
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,826
<i>Osoma</i>!

356
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,163
"<i>Keran humi</i>," right?

357
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,289
<i>Hinna</i>.

358
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,335
Give me the bottle!

359
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,920
Hands off, Nikaido!

360
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,547
No! I want it!

361
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,758
What's all the ruckus,
Sergeant Tsukishima?

362
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,055
Nikaido stole a bottle of morphine
and injected himself.

363
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,682
Don't blame me
if you die from an overdose.

364
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,352
-Give it back!
-Nikaido, behave.

365
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,812
You have to listen to the doctor.

366
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,939
Give it back!

367
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,524
Behave, Nikaido!

368
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,485
Behave.

369
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:33,201
Yohei, your right leg burned to a crisp
along with Edogai's house.

370
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,579
We need both legs to go after Sugimoto.

371
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,166
We wanna kill Sugimoto, right?

372
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,503
I can't say I approve
of your self-sabotaging behavior.

373
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,633
Stop that!

374
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,426
Nikaido!

375
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,303
Behave!

376
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,534
Shiraishi.

377
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,871
Hey, Sugimoto. You're here.

378
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,791
I finally remembered, Shiraishi.

379
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,418
Remembered what?

380
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,007
After Kazuo Henmi died, we met
a strange old man at the herring lodge.

381
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,635
That old man was Hijikata.

382
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,554
Shiraishi,

383
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,890
you've been secretly reporting to him.

384
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,477
You told him everything we did.

385
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,022
No,

386
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,857
I didn't.

387
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,026
Still trying to trick me?

388
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,361
That's one lie too many.

389
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,352
Sofia…

390
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,165
Damn it. What should I do?

391
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,389
This is getting scary.

392
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,324
Shiraishi.

393
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,627
Nailed it.

394
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,300
The gold's worthless to me if I'm dead.

395
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,887
Time for me to scram.

396
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,859
I'm Shiraishi, the Escape King.

397
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,654
You're…

398
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,491
Shiraishi, right?

399
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,369
-Shiraishi?
-Get him!

400
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,913
Shiraishi!

401
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,998
Arrest him!

402
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,882
Why, if it isn't Mr. Arisaka.

403
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,508
Oh, Tsurumi.

404
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,803
-How was Asahikawa, sir?
-What?

405
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,722
How was Asahikawa?

406
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
Oh.

407
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,475
They established a balloon unit.

408
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,897
They want to put weapons on it,
but that thing is filled with hydrogen.

409
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,065
One stray bullet, and it'll explode.

410
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,442
It isn't practical.

411
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,195
By the way,

412
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:41,073
what do you think about
my latest design, the Type 38 rifle?

413
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,619
Its beauty is rivaled only by its power.

414
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,495
That gun will sell.

415
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,584
Perhaps, but people will die
with every rifle sold.

416
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,629
My job is truly cursed.

417
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,341
Beauty and power
are two sides of the same coin.

418
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,262
The pursuit of beauty and functionality
creates powerful weapons.

419
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,808
One of my men survived a bear attack.
Do you know what he said?

420
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,061
"It was a beautiful creature."

421
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,814
Really? Sounds like an interesting fellow.

422
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:18,444
Unfortunately, that soldier, Nikaido,
is terribly depressed right now.

423
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,490
Could you help him get back on his feet?
I know it's a lot to ask.

424
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,033
Sure.

425
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:43,511
What do we do with Suzukawa,
the scammer posing as the village chief?

426
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,389
He's too much trouble.
Let's just kill him.

427
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,349
You'd kill a defenseless man?

428
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:54,105
I have information
on the other Abashiri escapees.

429
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,857
Really?

430
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,235
I doubt it.

431
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,862
He's a con artist.

432
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,865
He may be lying to buy time.

433
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,245
I'll rip your tongue out if you're lying.

434
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,457
We'll take him with us for now.

435
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,003
We'll discuss what to do with him
with the others.

436
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,133
Professor Penis!

437
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,684
The village has lost its men.
They want you to live here with them.

438
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,145
You're so popular.

439
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,982
You defeated a bear. They're certain
you'll give them strong children.

440
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,485
Professor Penis!

441
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,447
Sorry, but we have things to do.

442
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,616
Maybe I can leave my seed behind.

443
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,161
Don't take advantage of their weakness.

444
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,329
They're not weak.

445
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,040
Ainu women are tough.

446
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,542
This <i>kotan </i>will flourish again.

447
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,795
Come on, we should hurry.

448
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,341
I bet Shiraishi misses you, Sugimoto.

449
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,934
Ladies!

450
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,978
Professor Penis!

451
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,273
Ladies!

452
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,443
Professor Penis!

453
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,654
Ladies!

454
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:30,034
YUBARI

455
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,500
You've already met your soulmate, ma'am.

456
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,669
What? Who could it be?

457
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,339
He's a very handsome man.

458
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,635
Three men traveling with an Ainu girl?

459
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,429
Yeah. Have you seen them?

460
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,766
Wait. It must be them.

461
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,227
<i>Three ruffians selling bear gallbladder.</i>

462
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,731
<i>I'm sure the one in the army cap</i>
<i>is a ruthless criminal.</i>

463
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,150
Yeah, I could tell right away.

464
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,363
So they came through here.

465
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,034
OTARU

466
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:16,122
<i>The fastest route from Otaru to Abashiri</i>
<i>means going through Asahikawa.</i>

467
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,998
ASAHIKAWA

468
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,543
<i>Asahikawa is called the Military Capital</i>

469
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,379
<i>because Seventh Division HQ</i>
<i>is located there.</i>

470
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,966
<i>I knew they'd steer clear of it.</i>

471
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:27,967
ASAHIKAWA

472
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,051
OTARU - SAPPORO

473
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,137
<i>Since they were in Yubari,</i>

474
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,473
<i>they may have passed between</i>
<i>Mount Taisetsu and the Hidaka Mountains…</i>

475
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,391
TOKACHI

476
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,059
<i>…to get to Tokachi.</i>

477
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,063
Let's go to Tokachi.

478
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,943
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>,
we need to earn some money first.

479
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,446
The towns along the way are much smaller.

480
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,489
Yeah.

481
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,117
Next, please.

482
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,786
Is your companion a fortune teller?

483
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,997
Man, I'm jealous.

484
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,458
I wanna mooch off a pretty girl too.

485
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,042
"Mooch off"?

486
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,170
I'm not a mooch.

487
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,056
You stole morphine again?

488
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,725
Nikaido, let go.

489
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,186
I'm gonna tell Lieutenant Tsurumi!

490
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,189
Nikaido!

491
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,941
You have a wonderful guest.

492
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,027
What? A guest?

493
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,862
Who is it?

494
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,822
Please come in.

495
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,911
Who is that man?

496
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,415
So…

497
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,292
Who is he?

498
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,252
Guys?

499
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,505
Who is he?

500
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,631
I'm scared!

501
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,383
Who the hell are you?

502
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,718
Get lost!

503
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,387
Hi! You must be Nikaido.

504
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,640
Wow! Who are you?

505
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,017
Hmm? Did you just ask who I am?

506
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,479
I'm the one who designed that rifle.

507
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:09,026
This is Lieutenant General Narizo Arisaka,
the genius firearms inventor.

508
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,986
Stop that, Nikaido!

509
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,905
Behave.

510
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:16,367
Mr. Arisaka,
do you have the thing I requested?

511
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,955
Nikaido, I have a present for you.

512
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,583
Huh? A present? What is it?

513
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,961
I hope you like it.

514
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,172
Behold! Your new leg.

515
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,051
That's it? A prosthetic leg?

516
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,345
This is no ordinary prosthetic.

517
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,893
Who's that?!

518
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,440
I had to make it on short notice.
It can hold two shotgun shells.

519
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,362
It's only useful in close combat
against unsuspecting opponents.

520
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,822
That said,

521
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,409
if you want to incapacitate
someone at close range,

522
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,910
nothing beats a shotgun.

523
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,662
Wow.

524
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,207
Thanks, Mr. Name-I-Already-Forgot.

525
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,793
Who's shooting? This is a hospital!

526
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,551
Aren't you glad to have
that wonderful leg, Nikaido?

527
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,552
Yup.

528
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,279
We're almost at Kabato Prison.

529
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,782
The plan was to regroup
at the closest inn.

530
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,493
I gotta say, I'm disappointed.

531
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,497
Hard to believe this wimp's
one of the Abashiri escapees.

532
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,877
I'm a con artist. I use my head.

533
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,213
Unlike the other unsophisticated brutes,

534
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,925
I don't rely on violence
to get what I want.

535
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,845
I heard you ran marriage scams.

536
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,308
Why did your victims
fall for a shabby geezer like you?

537
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,018
I'm always in disguise.

538
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,437
This isn't the real me.

539
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,690
In fact, there isn't a real me.

540
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,364
The Seventh Division captured Shiraishi?

541
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,990
Was it Lieutenant Tsurumi?

542
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,117
No.

543
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,454
We didn't see Tsurumi.
It was another platoon.

544
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,082
According to the townsfolk,

545
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:33,170
the soldiers are from Seventh Division HQ,
out on a mission.

546
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,090
They were on their way back to Asahikawa.

547
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,842
It's highly likely

548
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,346
they took Shiraishi to Asahikawa.

549
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,849
They may be skinning him as we speak.

550
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,062
Ogata, go check it out.
You're in the Seventh Division.

551
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,356
I'm a deserter.

552
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,069
Shiraishi…

553
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,082
Let's just leave him.

554
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,334
We have a copy of his tattoo.

555
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,545
No.

556
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,088
I want to save him.

557
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,756
Sugimoto…

558
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,344
How? Do you have a death wish?

559
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,680
We'll use him.

560
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,474
What do you want me to do?

561
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,396
You got Choan Kumagishi out of prison.

562
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:37,359
Now you're gonna help us
get Shiraishi from Seventh Division HQ.

563
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,903
Are you crazy?

564
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,615
We're talking about Seventh Division HQ,
not a prison.

565
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,870
Suzukawa, if you don't help us,
I'll skin you.

566
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,917
If you mess this up,
the Seventh Division will skin you.

567
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,797
In other words, you have to pull this off
if you want to keep your skin.

568
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,093
First things first.

569
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:08,599
We need to find out where they're keeping
Shiraishi at Asahikawa HQ.

570
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,268
He'll pretend to be an officer?

571
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,271
He'd have to be someone very important

572
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,690
for them to share that information.

573
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,528
-A fictional senior officer from Tokyo.
-No.

574
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,907
Senior officers in the army
know each other.

575
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,242
They won't fall for it.

576
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,505
How about Shirosuke Inudo?

577
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,051
ABASHIRI PRISON

578
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:04,571
ABASHIRI PRISON WARDEN
SHIROSUKE INUDO

579
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
Inudo?

580
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,534
The Abashiri Prison warden?

581
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,536
-Does he look like him?
-No.

582
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:15,415
If you want to disguise yourself
as someone else,

583
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,504
you need to eliminate
as many differences as possible.

584
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,058
<i>First, trim the eyebrows.</i>

585
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,480
<i>Next, cut the hair.</i>

586
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,279
<i>As I recall, he combs his hair forward.</i>

587
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,656
Huh.

588
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,242
He's starting to look like him.

589
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,411
Is it good enough?

590
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,249
Something's missing.

591
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,753
The Inudo I know

592
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,798
is a strict perfectionist

593
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,926
obsessed with enforcing the rules.

594
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:13,015
He's also a hypocrite who imprisoned me
because of a personal grudge.

595
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,478
He's a twisted man, and it shows.

596
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,564
I see.

597
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,693
Well then, how about this?

598
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,205
Incredible.

599
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,964
Very impressive.

600
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,592
It's easy.

601
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,928
You can do it too.

602
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,098
A headscarf is all you need
to disguise yourself.

603
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,691
What the hell?

604
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,818
I just remembered.

605
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,030
We met at the herring lodge.

606
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,492
Gramps,

607
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,453
have we met before?

608
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,288
What, him? That's impossible.

609
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,541
I mean, this is Toshizo Hijikata.

610
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,960
I see.

611
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,589
You were working with Shiraishi
this whole time.

612
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,014
That's all in the past now.

613
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,321
Traitors can't be trusted.

614
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,956
We'll make them give us Shiraishi.

615
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,374
They shot Sugimoto!

616
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,126
Hurry up, or they'll catch us.

617
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,920
You'll join my hunt for the convicts.

618
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,172
Shiraishi, were you spying for Hijikata?

619
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,092
In war, you can't afford to lose.

620
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,886
When all this is over,
take me to your hometown.

621
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,305
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

622
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,387
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

623
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,930
