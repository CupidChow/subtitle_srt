00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,306
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,397
203 METER HILL

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,065
I'm

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,651
Immortal Sugimoto!

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,409
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

8
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,412
<i>With the help of Asirpa,</i>
<i>a young Ainu girl,</i>

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>and Shiraishi, an escaped convict,</i>
<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,543
We will find the gold.

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,672
I know about what happened
in Abashiri Prison.

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,549
Noppera-Bo

14
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,884
is Asirpa's father.

15
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,011
I'm going to meet Noppera-Bo.

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,389
I want to see with my own eyes
whether Noppera-Bo is Aca.

17
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>Hijikata's group, led by</i>
<i>Toshizo Hijikata, one of the escapees.</i>

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,523
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Lieutenant Tsurumi.</i>

19
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,528
<i>The two factions join the hunt,</i>
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,697
I want to make fake tattooed skins.

21
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,701
We shall throw the tattoo hunt into chaos.

22
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,413
<i>Sugimoto's group has six tattoos.</i>

23
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,666
<i>Hijikata's group has six.</i>

24
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,128
<i>The Seventh Division, led by Tsurumi,</i>

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,173
<i>now has two</i>
<i>after acquiring Funabashi's tattoo.</i>

26
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,510
<i>Twelve tattoos left.</i>

27
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:39,349
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of their grueling journey</i>

28
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,393
<i>to be the first to collect all 24 tattoos</i>

29
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,980
<i>and find the hidden trove of Ainu gold.</i>

30
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:56,032
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,663
Is this real or fake?

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,168
We need a way to tell them apart.

33
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,464
Gramps,

34
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,300
have we met before?

35
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,099
What, him? That's impossible.

36
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,601
I mean, this is Toshizo Hijikata.

37
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,939
Long time no see, Yoshitake Shiraishi.

38
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,027
Care to introduce me to your friends?

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,741
Was he the one
who visited your village, Kiroranke?

40
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,078
Her name is Asuko Kochobe.

41
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,038
Do you know her?

42
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,041
Yeah, that's him.

43
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,130
I have a question for you.

44
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,508
<i>Noppera-Bo is an Ainu, right?</i>

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,054
So,

46
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,141
you figured that out.

47
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,561
Do we join forces?

48
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,730
Whoa!

49
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,816
Or do we kill each other here?

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,401
Your choice.

51
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,951
If you have any tattooed skins,
we'll buy them.

52
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,663
We won't ask you to fight for our country.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,626
You can take the money and go home.

54
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,421
Find a wife and live a quiet life.

55
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,218
Or does that sound boring
to youngsters like you?

56
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,410
We want to meet Noppera-Bo
to confirm something.

57
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,546
You want to meet him?

58
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,137
Shall I prepare a meal?

59
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,766
You're the one from the hotel!

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,104
Why don't we continue the discussion
at the dining table?

61
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,112
This is <i>nanko-nabe</i>.

62
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,992
It's a local dish from the Sorachi region,
made popular by miners in Yubari.

63
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,578
Tripe stewed in miso,
just like <i>motsu-nabe</i>.

64
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,580
Ienaga…

65
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,667
This meat is normal meat, right?

66
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,591
Not to worry.

67
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,386
<i>Nanko </i>means "horse tripe"
in the local dialect.

68
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,846
It's horse meat.

69
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,975
I'm surprised you guys can work together.

70
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,854
Especially that guy
who used to serve Lieutenant Tsurumi.

71
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,899
You can't trust a traitor.

72
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,401
Sugimoto.

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,072
You almost killed me,
but I'm not the type to hold grudges.

74
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,409
Still, I'm deeply hurt by what you said.

75
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,911
Can we at least eat in peace?

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,580
He's right.

77
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,041
Everyone should say <i>hinna </i>for the food.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,714
In any case,

79
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,884
we have to find out
whether Sergeant Tsukishima is dead.

80
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,928
We can't leave Yubari before then.

81
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,349
If he didn't die,

82
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:55,521
we must find a way
to tell which skins are fake.

83
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,401
I know… someone who can help us.

84
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,363
A man called Choan Kumagishi.

85
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,282
Oh, that famous counterfeiter.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,579
I love paintings.
I met Kumagishi through an art dealer.

87
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,583
He has vast experience
creating counterfeit art.

88
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,711
Perhaps he can tell
the real skins from the fakes.

89
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,383
Well, where can we find him?

90
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,594
He's in Kabato Prison,
located in Tsukigata.

91
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:33,810
EPISODE 7: FAKE

92
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,894
I see.

93
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,273
-Can I have a look?
-Sure.

94
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,194
Let's go.

95
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,915
-Nope.
-Was there a soldier in there?

96
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,916
No idea.

97
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,169
-Can I ask something?
-Yes?

98
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,588
Was there a soldier among the dead?

99
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,925
A soldier? Doesn't seem like it.

100
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,969
No? I see.

101
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:09,971
Thanks.

102
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,902
There may be something in this house
that can help us tell the skins apart.

103
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,166
A firebomb.

104
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,923
Don't go out, Ienaga. You'll get shot.

105
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,718
They must be here to destroy the evidence.

106
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,348
There may be some early stachyurus fruit
left in Edogai's house.

107
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,350
Huh?

108
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,811
It's used for tanning.

109
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,647
We have to destroy all evidence!

110
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,527
If you find Saichi Sugimoto,
don't kill him.

111
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,070
He's mine!

112
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,865
Right?

113
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,703
If Lieutenant Tsurumi's men
are here to destroy the house,

114
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,290
we should assume
Sergeant Tsukishima made it out alive.

115
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah.

116
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,668
The first-floor windows are closed.

117
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,879
They have to use the front door.

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,924
I'll drive them to the entrance.

119
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,436
What was that?

120
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,854
Upstairs!

121
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,568
Get under the awning!

122
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,405
Ready? We're going in.

123
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,975
There's a lot of them.

124
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,065
Stay hidden.
He'll shoot you as soon as he sees you.

125
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,579
Charge!

126
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,042
Go upstairs!
Kill the sniper on the second floor!

127
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,412
Professor Penis…

128
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,956
Ienaga! Get over here!

129
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,250
Mr. Ushiyama!

130
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,395
Die, traitor!

131
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,658
What?

132
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,743
Want me to thank you?

133
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,287
I still don't like you.

134
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,789
Traitor.

135
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,882
-Hijikata, where are you?
-Huh?

136
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,137
Saichi Sugimoto!

137
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,069
We gotta get out now. Hurry!

138
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,113
Gramps, let's go.

139
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,470
Let's split up to keep a low profile.

140
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,307
We'll regroup at Kabato Prison.

141
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,479
If this doesn't pan out,
we'll have to go see Noppera-Bo.

142
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,232
He'll tell his daughter everything.

143
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,111
So you know she's his daughter.

144
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,366
I don't care who does what with the gold.

145
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,035
I just want a small share.

146
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,165
But Asirpa is an upstanding Ainu.

147
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,171
Did her father really steal the Ainu gold?

148
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,717
I want to see her get to the truth.

149
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,365
Professor Penis,
have some woodcock brains.

150
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,703
Are you sure that's edible?

151
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,456
Sugimoto, it's <i>hinna</i>, right?

152
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>Hinna.</i>

153
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,796
Professor Penis,

154
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
you don't like brains?

155
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,688
No.

156
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,565
I'm good.

157
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,491
Now we make <i>citatap</i>
with the meat and organs.

158
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,161
Here we go again. <i>Citatap</i>!

159
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,871
"<i>Citatap</i>"?

160
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,209
Please mince it
while saying "<i>citatap</i>," Professor Penis.

161
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,794
It's my family tradition.

162
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,633
<i>Citatap</i>.

163
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,844
<i>Citatap</i>.

164
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,224
<i>Citatap…</i>

165
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,270
<i>Citatap</i>…

166
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,188
Okay. Your turn, Ogata.

167
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,440
<i>Citatap </i>is a group effort.

168
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,412
Excuse me.

169
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,665
Asirpa, Ogata isn't saying "<i>citatap</i>."

170
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,713
Ogata.

171
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,591
What's wrong?

172
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,721
<i>Ci-ta-tap</i>.

173
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,765
<i>Ci-ta-tap</i>.

174
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,278
<i>Ohaw </i>made with woodcock <i>citatap</i>.

175
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,739
This looks good.

176
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,580
It's <i>hinna</i>.

177
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,541
We say <i>hinna </i>to show appreciation,
Professor Penis.

178
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,920
It really is good.

179
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,757
It's <i>hinna</i>.

180
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,261
Ogata, is it good?

181
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,275
<i>Korkoni</i>, or butterbur,
is a tasty food we eat in spring.

182
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,568
It can be eaten raw.

183
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,868
It's really fresh.

184
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,870
It really is good.

185
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,414
Ainu children snack on it.

186
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,877
But it leaves a black stain,
so everyone can tell when you've had it.

187
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,380
You know everything, little lady.

188
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,549
I hope the others aren't going hungry.

189
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,636
Kiroranke <i>nispa </i>will take care of them.

190
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,868
<i>Ichaniw </i>fillet seasoned with <i>korkoni</i>,
<i>pukusa</i>, and salt.

191
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:40,290
Of all the soups we cook in spring,
<i>ichaniw ohaw</i>, trout soup, is the best.

192
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,835
This looks good!

193
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,049
<i>Hinna</i>!

194
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,053
It's delicious.
The Siberian onion actually tastes sweet.

195
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,432
After spending the long winter
surviving on dried food,

196
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,978
every <i>kotan </i>now has
fresh vegetables to eat.

197
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,896
Spring brings us much joy.

198
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,108
The butterbur is a little bitter
but tender and delicious.

199
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,612
Sweet but a little bitter.
The taste of spring.

200
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,783
Here in Hokkaido,

201
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,328
there's no better ally than the Ainu.

202
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,004
So how do you plan on meeting
Choan Kumagishi

203
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,506
if he's in Kabato Prison?

204
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,594
Even if we pay him a visit,
there will be a guard with him.

205
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,765
We can't exactly roll out the skins
and ask him to inspect them.

206
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,602
Why not have Shiraishi sneak inside
to meet him?

207
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,689
We can think of it
as a test run for Abashiri Prison.

208
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,692
Leave it to me, the Escape King.

209
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,486
I won't even break a sweat.

210
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,407
Actually, Nagakura has connections
in Kabato Prison.

211
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,408
You do?

212
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:02,498
I used to teach swordsmanship
to the guards at Kabato Prison.

213
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,086
I may be able to persuade them
to arrange a meeting for us.

214
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,547
The Shinsengumi
fought against the new government.

215
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,093
I'm surprised they hired you
as an instructor.

216
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,096
Speaking of Kabato Prison,

217
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,142
my heart nearly stopped
when I saw you there.

218
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:27,314
It never occurred to me
that you'd been arrested and imprisoned.

219
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,902
The warden, Shirosuke Inudo,
had an older brother

220
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,407
who fought for the new government
and died in the Battle of Hakodate.

221
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,619
He blames me for his death.

222
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,375
If I hadn't seen you that day,
I'd never have known you were still alive.

223
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,504
I'd been visiting Kabato Prison
for 20 years,

224
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,258
but Inudo never said a word about you.

225
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,096
Luckily, the chief guard was sympathetic.

226
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,391
He let me speak with you.

227
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,109
Is that you, Gamushin?

228
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,612
"Reckless Shinpachi."

229
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,991
I'm too old for that nickname.

230
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,663
We last met in the fourth year
of the Keio era.

231
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,082
It's been a while.

232
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,709
CELL 24

233
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,752
After the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,

234
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,256
the Shinsengumi broke up.

235
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,760
I went to Edo and met you there.

236
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,558
Kondo was there with you.

237
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,438
He said to me, "You can join us
if you become my servant."

238
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,732
I had never been so insulted.

239
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:58,363
That was when I finally turned my back
on the Shinsengumi.

240
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:05,245
As you know…
Kondo and I didn't see eye to eye.

241
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,709
I only believed in the Shinsengumi…
because of you.

242
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,755
What's this, Shinpachi Nagakura?

243
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,135
You've gone soft in your old age.

244
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,265
If you hadn't protected me
from Kondo's wrath,

245
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,603
my head would have rolled many times over.

246
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:35,317
Your womanizing ways got on his nerves.

247
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,281
I learned it all from you, didn't I?

248
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:50,123
You were impulsive and foolish.

249
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,798
But your swordsmanship was beautiful.

250
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,933
Beautiful things deserve to be preserved.

251
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,897
Back then,

252
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,609
we parted on bad terms.

253
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,321
Did the two of you insult me

254
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,325
so I wouldn't follow you to certain death?

255
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,290
I've spent countless nights
going over it in my head.

256
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,210
Was that perhaps

257
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,256
one final act of kindness
from the two of you?

258
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,844
Am I right, Hijikata?

259
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,556
You're wrong.

260
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,561
You were an idiot,
and we couldn't stand you.

261
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:13,540
This is my chance…
to fight beside you one last time.

262
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,588
I know I'll be able to die
with honor in the end.

263
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,592
We're not fighting to die.

264
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,723
We're fighting for our future.

265
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,167
Nowadays, we Ainu use guns to hunt.

266
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,880
I know the shop owner.
He'll give us a good price.

267
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,427
Welcome.

268
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,940
You don't look like an Ainu.
Is that an army uniform under your robe?

269
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,485
Give me bullets for this Murata rifle.

270
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,070
Sure.

271
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:30,826
Oh, by the way,
an Ainu woman came in the other day.

272
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,123
She was looking for a blue-eyed Ainu girl.
Wanted to know where she lived.

273
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:40,460
As I recall,
there's a blue-eyed girl in your village.

274
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,754
What did the woman look like?

275
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,715
She had a fox pelt around her neck.

276
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,260
Said she was a fortune teller.

277
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,439
Should we hunt it?

278
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,399
It'd make a good souvenir.

279
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,278
Good, it hasn't seen us.

280
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,457
Yes!

281
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,460
Wow!

282
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,716
I was aiming for its head.

283
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,051
You got distracted.

284
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,846
Still, you got it with one shot.

285
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,725
Is that kid from the village?
Haven't seen him before.

286
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,687
Oh, him? His whole family is dead.

287
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,732
The elderly villagers look after him.

288
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,320
He's an odd one.
Doesn't play with the other children.

289
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,032
But he seems interested in hunting.

290
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,537
Want a closer look?
Stop hiding and come here.

291
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,590
Why was this <i>yuk </i>alone?

292
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,927
Male sika deer leave the herd
once they're grown.

293
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,723
They leave their parents
and start a new family.

294
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,935
A new family?

295
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,852
Yeah.

296
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,396
What's your name?

297
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,066
Cikapasi. Nice name, right?

298
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,817
Cikapasi.

299
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,444
What does it mean?

300
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,405
It means "to erect the penis."

301
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,868
In other words… a boner?

302
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,750
That's a good name, Cikapasi.

303
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,710
Yes.

304
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,338
A very good name.

305
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,926
Boner.

306
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,599
Your leg has healed nicely.

307
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,186
Tanigaki, what are your plans
for the future?

308
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,731
Is there someone waiting for you
back home?

309
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,077
Cikapasi, what's all the commotion?

310
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,205
They say her fortune-telling is spot-on.

311
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,378
Oh my, I see a handsome <i>nispa</i>
has joined us.

312
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,632
I love men with scars on their faces.

313
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,513
My name is Inkarmat.

314
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,016
It means "the woman who sees."

315
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,228
Shall I tell your fortune, handsome <i>nispa</i>?

316
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,024
No, I'll pass.

317
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:50,942
Come on.

318
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,990
Did your younger sister pass away?

319
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,999
I was right.

320
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,043
My condolences.

321
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,047
How did you…

322
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,216
I came here to look for someone.

323
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,892
Does a girl with blue eyes
live in this <i>kotan</i>?

324
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,229
My <i>siratki kamuy </i>told me to come here.

325
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,153
I met her near Yufutsu.

326
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,490
She said she was on a journey.

327
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,785
There were three <i>nispa </i>with her.

328
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,138
Among them,

329
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,433
there's a man who'll betray Asirpa.

330
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,686
A very dangerous man.

331
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:16,027
At this rate,
Asirpa's life will be in danger.

332
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,798
How's Huci doing?

333
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,551
She said she had a dream.

334
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,388
One in which she never meets Asirpa again.

335
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,143
Is that why she's so depressed?

336
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,481
<i>We Ainu take fortune-telling seriously.</i>

337
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,277
We're sensitive to bad omens.

338
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:03,158
Dreams are special to us.
We think of them as prophecies.

339
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,662
I blame that fortune teller
for making us worry.

340
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,710
Then again,
her predictions are eerily accurate.

341
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,548
I'll do an <i>epotara</i>. Want to do one too?

342
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,342
<i>Epotara</i>?

343
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,553
A purification ritual.

344
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,058
ONE YEAR AGO

345
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,145
Lieutenant Tsurumi,
have you heard of <i>kanemochi</i>?

346
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,734
Ani <i>matagi </i>like me
use it as emergency rations.

347
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,195
<i>Kanemochi</i>?

348
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,489
Never heard of it.

349
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,033
Does it taste like rice cake?

350
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,455
<i>We soak the rice overnight</i>
<i>before adding miso or salt.</i>

351
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,583
<i>Then we grind it, wrap it in leaves,</i>

352
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,795
<i>and cook it by burying it in the hearth.</i>

353
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,259
<i>Unlike us, the Tozawa </i>matagi
<i>forbid adding miso to their </i>kanemochi<i>.</i>

354
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,221
So it differs between villages.

355
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,222
That's right.

356
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:55,061
I knew my strict father wouldn't approve,
so I kept it a secret from everyone,

357
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:01,442
but I actually changed the recipe
of the <i>kanemochi </i>I make for myself.

358
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:03,987
One day,

359
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,823
a fellow <i>matagi </i>found out.

360
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,867
How?

361
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:14,080
It happened when we were hunting <i>aoshishi</i>,
what we call the Japanese serow.

362
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,252
<i>Matagi </i>hunt in groups,
with each person playing a specific role.

363
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,506
I was new to it and wasn't allowed a gun,

364
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,761
so they put me in charge of driving prey
to the hunters by shouting.

365
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,641
<i>One day,</i>

366
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:38,521
<i>I went up the mountain with a hunter</i>
<i>a year older than me, Kenkichi Aoyama.</i>

367
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,732
<i>We encountered a blizzard.</i>

368
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,151
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

369
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:44,903
Kenkichi.

370
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,779
That way.

371
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,907
Over there.

372
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,495
<i>We found shelter in a cave</i>
<i>but couldn't leave for days.</i>

373
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,125
<i>Our roasted beans and rice</i>
<i>quickly ran out.</i>

374
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,756
<i>We save </i>kanemochi <i>for last</i>
<i>when there's nothing left to eat.</i>

375
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,093
<i>A single bite is enough</i>
<i>to stave off hunger.</i>

376
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,930
<i>Ke</i>.

377
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:20,021
This may be our last meal.

378
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,191
Speak for yourself.

379
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,945
I'll eat you to survive.

380
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,241
<i>I shared my </i>kanemochi <i>with Kenkichi.</i>

381
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,662
<i>Even as the blizzard raged on,</i>

382
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,249
<i>we laughed and joked about</i>
<i>the </i>kanemochi <i>being our last meal.</i>

383
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,632
Did you add something to this <i>kanemochi</i>?

384
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,426
What's this flavor?

385
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,179
Wait, don't tell me.

386
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,722
Let me guess.

387
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,560
This is…

388
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,146
I know.

389
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,564
It's walnut.

390
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,275
You added walnut to it, Genjiro.

391
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,987
Yeah.

392
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,448
Please don't tell my father.

393
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,418
<i>Kenkichi eventually married Fumi,</i>
<i>my younger sister.</i>

394
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,254
<i>He became my brother-in-law.</i>

395
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,803
<i>One day,</i>
<i>as I was making </i>kanemochi <i>at home…</i>

396
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:41,519
<i>my older brother ran in, pale as a ghost.</i>

397
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,354
Fumi is…

398
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,360
Kenkichi's house is on fire!

399
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:58,578
<i>Fumi and Kenkichi lived a quiet life</i>
<i>up in the mountain, away from the village.</i>

400
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,416
<i>By the time I arrived,</i>
<i>their hut had burned down.</i>

401
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,792
Fumi!

402
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,922
<i>I found Fumi's charred body inside.</i>

403
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,510
<i>I looked closer</i>
<i>and saw she'd been stabbed in the heart.</i>

404
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,806
<i>Next to her was Kenkichi's hunting knife.</i>

405
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,936
<i>To us </i>matagi<i>,</i>
<i>our hunting knife is part of who we are.</i>

406
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,775
<i>Kenkichi was nowhere to be found.</i>

407
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,652
Kenkichi!

408
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,281
<i>I looked for him like a man possessed</i>
<i>but couldn't find him.</i>

409
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,450
Kenkichi! Where are you?!

410
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,661
Show yourself, Kenkichi!

411
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,455
<i>One day,</i>

412
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:47,335
<i>I heard that Kenkichi had joined</i>
<i>the Seventh Division in Hokkaido.</i>

413
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,713
Genjiro!

414
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,842
Genjiro, wait. Don't be hasty.

415
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,261
Stop, Genjiro!

416
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,057
Don't walk away from your village
just to get revenge!

417
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,434
Don't throw your life away!

418
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,229
Fumi was murdered!
You expect me to do nothing?

419
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,232
Screw the <i>matagi</i>.

420
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,651
I'm never coming back.

421
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,532
But I didn't find Kenkichi.

422
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,830
Right before the war, I got a telegram
informing me of my mother's death.

423
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,375
<i>Fumi's horrific death</i>

424
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,130
<i>and my decision to join the army</i>
<i>had been too much for her to bear.</i>

425
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,882
<i>She died after a sudden decline.</i>

426
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,722
<i>I blamed it all on Kenkichi.</i>
<i>My hatred for him grew.</i>

427
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,228
<i>I was sure I'd find him at Port Arthur,</i>
<i>where the soldiers were gathered.</i>

428
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,649
<i>I planned on shooting him in the back</i>
<i>amid the chaos of war.</i>

429
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,867
<i>I saw a man covered in blood</i>
<i>sitting by a trench.</i>

430
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,412
<i>Was it his blood or the enemy's?</i>

431
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,248
<i>I couldn't even see his face.</i>

432
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,127
<i>But I saw he was wearing a white sash.</i>

433
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,174
<i>A survivor of the suicide squad</i>
<i>deployed the previous night.</i>

434
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,635
Got anything to eat?

435
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,891
<i>I gave him some food.</i>

436
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,602
<i>My </i>kanemochi<i>.</i>

437
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,312
<i>Ke</i>.

438
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,774
Appreciate it.

439
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,445
Thank you.

440
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,786
It's chewy.

441
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,666
Is this rice cake? Tastes like miso.

442
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,002
Is it from Akita?

443
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,047
How did you know?

444
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,341
I knew it.

445
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,178
You said "<i>ke</i>."
It means "eat" in your dialect, right?

446
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,515
In my First Division platoon,

447
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,894
there's a soldier from Ani, Akita.

448
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,691
He taught me that
in the Akita dialect, "<i>ke</i>" means "eat."

449
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,694
<i>At last, I had found him.</i>

450
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,906
<i>Kenkichi hadn't gone to Hokkaido.</i>

451
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,825
<i>He had run to Tokyo</i>
<i>and was in the First Division.</i>

452
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,829
<i>But I had been too optimistic.</i>

453
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,292
<i>I could barely stay alive,</i>
<i>let alone look for Kenkichi.</i>

454
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,630
<i>As the Russians grew desperate,</i>

455
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,176
<i>they began coming for us</i>
<i>with bombs strapped to their bodies.</i>

456
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,805
Stop him!

457
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,892
<i>We shot him several times,</i>
<i>but he kept on coming.</i>

458
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,983
<i>Suddenly, a man jumped out</i>
<i>from right beside me.</i>

459
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,026
Kenkichi!

460
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,311
<i>It was the moment I'd been waiting for.</i>

461
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,229
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

462
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,649
<i>Kenkichi was still alive,</i>

463
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,736
<i>but he could no longer see or hear.</i>

464
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,655
Kenkichi.

465
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,825
I finally found you.

466
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,580
I'll gouge your heart out.

467
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,207
Like what…

468
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,502
Like what you did to Fumi!

469
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,546
Fumi…

470
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:06,969
Why?

471
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,890
Why did you kill Fumi, Kenkichi?!

472
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,353
I don't know who you are,

473
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,688
but please tell them.

474
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,192
They live in Ani, Akita.

475
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,278
Tell the Tanigaki family…

476
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,782
One day,

477
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,326
my wife contracted smallpox.

478
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:40,336
"If the village finds out someone
from the Tanigaki family has smallpox,

479
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:46,008
they might banish my father and brothers
from the Ani <i>matagi</i>."

480
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,097
"Before someone comes to check on us,

481
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,100
I want you to kill me

482
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,603
and leave the village."

483
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,271
That's what she told me.

484
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,694
I couldn't let Fumi die alone.

485
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,031
I was prepared to die with her.

486
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,829
But… she wouldn't let me.

487
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,675
Kenkichi, if you haven't been infected,

488
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,012
think about how to spend your life.

489
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,267
Find your own purpose.

490
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,944
Fumi…

491
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,700
<i>I tried</i>

492
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,704
<i>to make it as painless as possible</i>

493
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,039
<i>for her.</i>

494
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,593
I set fire to the hut,
just like she told me to.

495
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:17,725
Then I left the village without telling
Fumi's family about her death.

496
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,852
All this time…

497
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:26,650
I've had to live
with the guilt of killing her.

498
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,240
It's all… my fault.

499
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,702
I caused her family

500
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,122
to suffer for so long.

501
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,250
I hope this will

502
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,378
help ease their pain.

503
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,424
So please…

504
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,511
help me tell them.

505
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,138
They live in Ani, Akita.

506
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,308
The Tanigaki family.

507
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,353
The Tanigaki family…

508
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,813
I beg you.

509
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,275
Please.

510
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,840
A walnut…

511
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,261
<i>kanemochi</i>?

512
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,348
It can't be.

513
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,643
Genjiro?

514
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,623
<i>Kenkichi found his purpose</i>
<i>and gave his life for it.</i>

515
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,380
<i>Every day, I wonder what I was born for.</i>

516
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,054
I can't go back to my hometown.

517
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,267
I'm too ashamed
to face my father and brother.

518
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,062
Tanigaki.

519
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,694
I need you.

520
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,742
But first,

521
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,995
could you make <i>kanemochi </i>for me?

522
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:23,827
Granny.

523
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,456
I'll bring Asirpa back safely.

524
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,043
This is my purpose in life.

525
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,921
Time to repay my debt.

526
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,719
<i>Ke</i>.

527
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:45,140
It's something I eat back home.
I made it soft enough for you to eat.

528
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,893
I hope it gives you the energy you need.

529
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,238
Go on, Osoma.
You have something for him, right?

530
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,411
It's a hand cover, a <i>tekunpe</i>.

531
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,747
She only had time to make one.

532
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,752
When Ainu women find a man they like,
they make him a pair of <i>tekunpe</i>.

533
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,590
Thanks, Osoma.

534
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,804
I promise I'll be back.
Will you make me the other one?

535
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:02,176
Shall I divine
Asirpa's whereabouts for you?

536
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,429
No, thanks.
I don't believe you can see the future.

537
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,265
I'm doing this for Huci and the others.

538
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,977
Then let's go, Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>.

539
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,438
Why are you following me?

540
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,901
A man traveling alone with a gun
attracts suspicion.

541
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:24,114
If we pretend to be a married couple,
no one will suspect you.

542
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,880
There's a man called Tanigaki. Use him.

543
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,467
His leg should be healed by now.

544
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,267
It looks like I'm not the only one.

545
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,607
Cikapasi, go back to the <i>kotan</i>
before they start to worry.

546
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,654
My whole family's dead.

547
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,198
No one's waiting for me to go home.

548
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,371
Why not?

549
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:17,709
My <i>siratki kamuy </i>says
it's good luck to take him with us.

550
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:22,089
No one will suspect us
if the three of us pretend to be family.

551
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,633
We're pretending to be family?

552
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,511
Okay, you'll be my big sister.

553
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,305
I get to touch your boobs
without you getting mad.

554
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,309
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>, you'll be the guy
with big balls who lives next door.

555
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,602
Cikapasi.

556
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,563
That's not a family member.

557
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,449
Look! There's a <i>kotan</i>.

558
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,537
Kabato's not far now, but let's rest here.

559
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,963
Hello.

560
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,090
What brings you here?

561
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,926
We're just passing through.

562
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,305
We're looking for a place to sleep
and some rice.

563
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,890
We'll pay you, of course.

564
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,433
Oh, I see.

565
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,352
You're fluent in Japanese.

566
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,899
As a young man, I worked
as a transporter for the ethnic Japanese.

567
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,069
They were panning for gold
deep in the mountains.

568
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:31,533
I'd fill my boat with rice and salt
and ferry it all upstream.

569
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,535
Brings back memories.

570
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,412
I used to pan for gold too.

571
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,332
Hey, what's that?

572
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,710
Oh, that's a cage for bear cubs.

573
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,546
Huh?

574
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,390
Shiraishi was caught?

575
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,601
Something isn't right.

576
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,437
-He's Choan Kumagishi.
-An Abashiri escapee?

577
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,023
Where'd you take Asirpa?!

578
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,025
They must've taken him to Asahikawa.

579
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,693
He may be lying to buy time.

580
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,363
We'll have to rely on him
to meet Noppera-Bo.

581
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,864
Do you have a death wish?

582
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,991
Traitors can't be trusted.

583
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,405
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

584
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,990
