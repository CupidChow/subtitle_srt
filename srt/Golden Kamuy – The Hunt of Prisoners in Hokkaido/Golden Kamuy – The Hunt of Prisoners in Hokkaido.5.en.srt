1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,432
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,397
203 METER HILL

4
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,651
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,325
I want to keep my promise to Toraji.

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,454
<i>With the help of Asirpa,</i>
<i>a young Ainu girl,</i>

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>and Shiraishi, an escaped convict,</i>
<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,543
We will find the gold.

10
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah.

11
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,672
I know about what happened
in Abashiri Prison.

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,174
Noppera-Bo

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,259
is Asirpa's father.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,678
I'm going to meet Noppera-Bo.

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,432
I want to see with my own eyes
whether Noppera-Bo is Aca.

16
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>Hijikata's group, led by</i>
<i>Toshizo Hijikata, one of the escapees.</i>

17
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,858
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Lieutenant Tsurumi.</i>

18
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:11,738
<i>The two factions join the hunt,</i>
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:16,284
<i>Sugimoto's group has five tattoos.</i>

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,411
<i>And Hijikata's group…</i>

21
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,872
Ms. Ienaga!

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,794
<i>After acquiring</i>
<i>Ienaga's and Takarai's tattoos,</i>

23
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>as well as a copy of Henmi's,</i>
<i>they now have six.</i>

24
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Tsurumi, has one.</i>

25
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>Fourteen tattoos left.</i>

26
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:41,059
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of their grueling journey</i>

27
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,646
<i>to be the first to collect all 24 tattoos</i>

28
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,899
<i>and find the hidden trove of Ainu gold.</i>

29
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,035
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

30
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,082
One and one, even.

31
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,167
Yes!

32
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,168
Damn it.

33
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,384
Inkarmat, help me earn lots of money!

34
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,762
I don't understand how gambling works.

35
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,389
How do you make a bet?

36
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,146
You guess the outcome
of the two-dice roll.

37
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,443
If you think the numbers on the dice will
add up to an even number, you bet on even.

38
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,487
Otherwise, you bet on odd.

39
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,449
Winners get the tokens
of those who guessed incorrectly.

40
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,076
Game on.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,079
Five and two, odd.

42
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,624
What happens if everyone bets
on the same outcome?

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,920
It's the dealer's job to make sure
there are enough bets both ways.

44
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,091
If push comes to shove,
the house has to put up money,

45
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,180
or the gambling boss over there
will lose face.

46
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:06,561
In other words, you just have to tell me
whether I should bet on even or odd,

47
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,022
and the money will keep rolling in.

48
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
Sounds fun. I'll do it.

49
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,695
Any more bets on odd?

50
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,863
The bets are in.

51
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:25,038
It seems that Shiraishi went out
with the fortune teller we met yesterday.

52
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,998
That sly bastard.

53
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,668
Don't tell me he went to…

54
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,798
What will you bet on, Mr. Shiraishi?

55
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,134
Well…

56
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,928
Odd?

57
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:40,845
Odd.

58
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,809
No, betting on odd is a bad idea.

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,479
That means I should bet on even, right?

60
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,774
All right.

61
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,943
Even, odd, even, odd.

62
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,653
Is there one more for even?

63
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,489
Even!

64
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,243
The bets are in.

65
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,870
Last call for bet changes.

66
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,789
Anyone?

67
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,041
Game on.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,336
Five and three, even.

69
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,172
I won.

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,590
I really won!

71
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,175
Yes!

72
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,594
You're amazing, Inkarmat!

73
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,845
Help me win again.

74
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,516
Mr. Shiraishi,
I have just the thing for you.

75
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,603
This is an <i>ekaeka </i>talisman.

76
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,357
The protective power
of the Fire God resides in it.

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,568
Wrap it around your wrist
to ward off misfortune.

78
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,320
Thanks, Inkarmat!

79
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,989
Twenty sen per piece.

80
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:42,991
Huh?

81
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,704
That Ainu woman is up to something.

82
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,207
Should I kick her out?

83
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,750
Don't bother.

84
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,963
If praying to the gods
is all it takes to win at gambling,

85
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,299
we'd all be monks.

86
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,636
We need two more bets on odd.

87
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,805
Odd!

88
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,974
The bets are in.

89
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,351
Last call for bet changes.

90
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,603
Anyone?

91
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,148
Game on.

92
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,444
Four and one, odd.

93
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,279
Yes!

94
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,325
<i>Ekaeka</i>!

95
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,244
You're amazing, Inkarmat!

96
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,454
Help me win again.

97
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,750
Mr. Shiraishi,
I have just the thing for you.

98
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,129
This is an <i>ikema </i>root.

99
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,592
It has an awful smell
and was once used to ward off evil.

100
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,138
Spray it on an arrow,
and it'll fly straight at your prey.

101
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,973
But how much does it cost?

102
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,894
Regular price is 70 sen,
but you can get it for just 50 sen today.

103
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,937
I'll take it!

104
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,397
I'll bet on even next.

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,900
He won again.

106
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,653
Should I kick them out?

107
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,405
Don't bother.

108
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,910
That was just a fluke.

109
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,045
Three and one, even.

110
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,762
You there.

111
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,264
Sell me that <i>ekaeka </i>thing too.

112
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,766
Gladly.

113
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,144
I have a weak spot for men with scars.

114
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,689
-Give me one too.
-Me too.

115
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,691
<i>Ekaeka </i>is 20 sen apiece.

116
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,110
I want one too.

117
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,988
This is the nearest gambling den
from the <i>kotan</i>.

118
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,123
Let's go in.

119
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,376
<i>Ekaeka </i>for gambling.

120
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,628
<i>Ikema </i>to help you focus!

121
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,049
Today only,
you can get both for just 70 sen.

122
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,595
That's a 20 sen discount.

123
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,514
But wait, there's more!

124
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,434
The first ten wonderful <i>nispa</i>
who make a purchase

125
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,936
will get another <i>ekaeka </i>free of charge!

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,604
I'll buy it!

127
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,774
I'll take all the <i>ekaeka </i>you have.

128
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,282
Everyone will start copying his bets.

129
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,119
We'll lose money at this rate.

130
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,667
Found them.
The Excrement King and Red Fox.

131
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,842
Shiraishi.

132
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,218
Yeah?

133
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,514
I wondered where that stink of poverty
was coming from.

134
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,932
It's you guys.

135
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,934
-You bastard.
-What?

136
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,353
How dare you gamble with Asirpa's money--

137
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,271
Hold on.

138
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,274
Did you win all that money?

139
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,861
I have Lady Inkarmat on my side.

140
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,781
Thanks to her, I'm invincible.

141
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,495
Should I bet on even next, ma'am?

142
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,788
Snap out of it, Shiraishi!

143
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,752
Did you really think fortune-telling
would help you win at gambling?

144
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,254
Don't let the fox-woman trick you.

145
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,840
Who are you calling a fox-woman, you brat?

146
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,218
That's Lady Inkarmat to you!

147
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,636
Your breath stinks!

148
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,849
That's it. We're done for today.

149
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,017
Leave, all of you.

150
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,854
We don't want any of that
shady divination business here.

151
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,314
Excuse me?

152
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,274
Did I hear you right?

153
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,736
Your reputation will be ruined.

154
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:54,116
I bet no one will come here to gamble
once they find out

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,328
you close for the day
when you're about to lose money.

156
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,913
You chickening out?

157
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,707
-Coward!
-You call this a gambling house?

158
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,833
Roll the dice!

159
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,669
-Way to ruin our fun.
-Boss.

160
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,462
One last game.

161
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,135
You against us.

162
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,223
-Wait just a damn minute.
-Don't bet everything!

163
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,934
Fine.

164
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,523
I'll take all your money
and bleed you dry.

165
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,748
Lady Inkarmat,
let's show them what we're capable of.

166
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,294
I plan to bet all my money on even.

167
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,838
Don't be stupid, Shiraishi.

168
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,512
The gods advise against it.

169
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,513
Then…

170
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,183
I choose odd!

171
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,603
-Odd!
-Odd.

172
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,229
-Odd.
-Odd.

173
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,858
Watch. You're in good hands.

174
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,621
Game on!

175
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,039
Come on.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,874
Odd.

177
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,481
Two and six, even.

178
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,817
You cheated!

179
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,777
Wait!

180
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,154
-I don't believe this!
-What the hell?

181
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,573
Screw you! It's all your fault!

182
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,618
It's a scam! That baldy tricked us!

183
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,578
Screw you, Baldy!

184
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,789
Fox-woman!

185
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,376
Running away
now that your scam's been exposed?

186
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,586
You cheated Shiraishi out of his money.

187
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,505
It isn't a scam.

188
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,884
The <i>siratki kamuy </i>hit Mr. Shiraishi's face
on the way down.

189
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>It caused fate to change.</i>

190
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,104
This works out better for you,
does it not?

191
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,192
If they strike it rich now,

192
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,362
will they still be willing to help you?

193
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,075
Your eyes…

194
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,247
are the same beautiful color
as your father's.

195
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,209
How do you know about Aca?

196
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,586
Let's meet again.

197
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,113
Where's that woman?

198
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,948
She vanished.

199
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,075
She's a sly one.

200
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,580
That woman seemed to know about my <i>aca</i>.

201
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,375
Is she after the gold too?

202
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,419
I don't know.

203
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,756
If she's after the tattoos,
we'll see her again.

204
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,049
Let's go to Hidaka.

205
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,429
Where's Shiraishi?

206
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,433
Over there. He went mad
after getting tricked by a fox.

207
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,686
Yes!

208
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,313
Look at all this money!

209
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,776
Let's leave him.
He'll catch up on his own.

210
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,580
We could be having a feast right now
if I'd won that last game.

211
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,499
Why do we gotta eat seal meat?

212
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,751
Got a problem? Don't eat it, then.

213
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,211
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,715
Up north in Karafuto,
seals are an indispensable part of life.

215
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,886
To Karafuto Ainu, they're gods
to be worshiped, just like brown bears.

216
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,515
We call seals <i>tukar</i>.

217
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,476
"One who moves
around the edges of the sea."

218
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,272
Seals are uncommon in this region,
so they're not considered <i>kamuy </i>here.

219
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,942
So they're not <i>tukar kamuy</i>?

220
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,111
I guess every region has its own gods.

221
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:42,988
Yeah.

222
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,368
Anyway, I'm not convinced
that black seal meat tastes good.

223
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,329
Seal meat has a strong taste of blood,

224
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,498
but if we boil it thoroughly--

225
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,251
What's wrong?

226
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,253
The <i>pukusakina</i>…

227
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,131
The soft windflowers
I harvested last year…

228
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,175
We've run out!

229
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,221
Meat tastes a lot better with windflowers.

230
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,558
They complement each other perfectly.

231
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,144
I can't believe we've run out!

232
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,692
She wasn't this upset when she was told
that Noppera-Bo was her father.

233
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,998
Eat up.

234
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,209
Plain seal meat
boiled in plain salt water.

235
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,295
Thanks for the food.

236
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,880
-Thanks.
-Thanks for the food.

237
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,967
Wow, it's good.

238
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,887
It's good as it is.

239
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,431
It's tender and <i>hinna</i>, Asirpa.

240
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,476
It tastes like
a cross between fish and beef.

241
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,687
It isn't gamy at all.

242
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,856
It's very <i>hinna</i>, Asirpa.

243
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,234
They're both thankful for the tasty meal.

244
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,819
Cheer up.

245
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,573
If only I had windflowers…

246
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:09,992
Shiraishi,

247
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,455
about that convict you heard about
from a prostitute in Sapporo…

248
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,956
What does he look like?

249
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,335
All I know is that he's a middle-aged man.

250
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,046
Oh, and she also said

251
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,967
that he was going to meet
an American named Dunn.

252
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,180
So we just have to find a man called Dunn?

253
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,097
Yeah.

254
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,018
There aren't that many Americans.
He should be easy to find.

255
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
<i>Hinna</i>.

256
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,700
HIDAKA

257
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,291
EPISODE 5: THE HOUSE WHERE FEAR DWELLS

258
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,417
I see.

259
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,631
A middle-aged man
with a strange tattoo, you say?

260
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,175
Yeah. Did he come to see you?

261
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,682
Maybe he did, maybe not.

262
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,895
Two soldiers from the Seventh Division
came by yesterday.

263
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,233
They were also looking for a tattooed man.

264
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,570
They looked strong,
with scars on their faces.

265
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,787
I see that everyone's desperate
to get their hands on him, which means

266
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,666
he must be someone of considerable value.

267
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,128
So where is the tattooed man?

268
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,630
Did you tell the Seventh Division?

269
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,716
Not so fast.

270
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,052
If you wish to obtain something of value,

271
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,055
you must offer
something of value in return.

272
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:02,521
I'll tell you where the tattooed man is
if you help me kill a monster.

273
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,440
A what now?

274
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,734
A demonic creature.

275
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,070
It has attacked several of my horses.

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,117
My men are too afraid of the monster
to try to kill it.

277
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,166
If you kill it and bring it to me,

278
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,253
I'll tell you where the tattooed man is.

279
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,006
Cut the crap
and tell us where he is, old man.

280
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,549
"Old man"?

281
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,302
Mr. Dunn!

282
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,014
The monster showed up again.

283
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,017
Follow me.

284
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,449
The horse was attacked here.
The blood trail leads towards the forest.

285
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,204
This footprint…

286
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,665
There's something over there!

287
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,168
That's it! That's the monster!

288
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,836
That's no monster.

289
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
That's a bear, a huge one.

290
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,299
Shoot it. My arrows won't reach.

291
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,383
Move, Shiraishi.

292
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,885
Shiraishi!

293
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,681
Shiraishi, move your butt!

294
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,060
Your bullet only grazed it.

295
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,812
You scared it off.

296
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,813
Damn.

297
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,358
So that's the monster.

298
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,944
What was it doing, anyway?

299
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,280
It never kills my horses right away.

300
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,908
It drags them into the forest
and eats them there.

301
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,161
We'll take you up on your offer.

302
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,162
Are you sure?

303
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,081
We can take on a bear.

304
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,544
This is a claw from the monster.

305
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,381
I shot it off with my rifle last fall,
along with a toe.

306
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,635
But the footprint…

307
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,764
Exactly. The bear isn't missing any toes.

308
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,809
I shot out an eye last summer,

309
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,354
but it wasn't missing an eye
when I saw it again.

310
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,691
There's a reason I call it a monster.

311
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,612
The bear always returns unharmed,
no matter what I do to it.

312
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,906
It's immortal.

313
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,367
"Immortal."

314
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,912
I'll be waiting for your good news.

315
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,373
Let's do this!

316
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,835
Shiraishi, don't come with us.
You'll just get in the way.

317
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,713
Huh? Hey, wait!

318
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,381
Where should I go?

319
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,135
Go through that forest.
There's an old farmhouse for guests.

320
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,513
Wait up, Kiro!

321
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,890
Come with me, please?

322
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,352
Can you two handle it yourselves?

323
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,273
We'll be fine.

324
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,155
A strange guest at Mr. Dunn's ranch?

325
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,533
Yeah. Did a middle-aged man
come by recently?

326
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,661
I'm not sure.

327
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,164
I started working here just recently.

328
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,793
Sugimoto, look at that.

329
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,551
There's fur around the mound.

330
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,804
Mr. Dunn's horse
that was attacked last week.

331
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,648
What are you doing?

332
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,402
If I stand on top of its food,
the bear will get mad and come at me.

333
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,868
That must be the farmhouse for guests.

334
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,339
Asirpa's gonna be so happy.

335
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,008
I'll go on ahead.

336
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:00,926
Sure.

337
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,852
A bear!

338
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,770
Shiraishi.

339
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,438
Steady now.

340
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,107
Don't run.

341
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,318
Damn baldy!

342
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,365
Throw your belt at it!

343
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,908
Bears hate snakes!

344
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,998
Hurry, Shiraishi!

345
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,332
Wait!

346
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,294
What's all this racket?

347
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,795
Whoa! What the hell?

348
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,048
What the… What's going on?

349
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,591
There's a bear outside.

350
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,385
-Do you have a gun?
-What?

351
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,220
There are no guns in here.

352
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,562
It's too wary to enter right away.
Let's block the door.

353
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,065
-Shiraishi.
-What?

354
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,066
Give me a hand.

355
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,114
Hurry up.

356
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,032
One sec!

357
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,076
Sugimoto and the others
will be here with their guns soon.

358
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,370
We just have to hold out until then.

359
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,836
What are you doing?

360
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,588
Huh?

361
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,341
Did you just come in?

362
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,842
Where did you enter from?

363
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,053
From the back door.

364
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,181
Shit! We gotta barricade that one too!

365
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,268
Come help us!

366
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,145
What's happening?

367
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,397
There's a bear outside.

368
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,690
What? A bear?

369
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,817
What the…

370
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,819
Kiro, get over here!

371
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,904
What's wrong?

372
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,542
What the hell is this?

373
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,803
Sugimoto, don't get between
the bear and me.

374
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,265
My poison arrow kills instantly,
even if it doesn't hit the vitals.

375
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
It really did come.

376
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,121
It must've broken then.

377
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,672
Let's retreat for now.

378
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,094
That bear was missing a toe.

379
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,847
It's the one
that got its toe shot off last fall.

380
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,225
Mystery solved. The bear isn't immortal.
There's just two of them.

381
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,102
Yeah. Let's hurry!

382
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,108
You guys…

383
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,236
What the hell is this?

384
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,447
I don't know.

385
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,992
Don't play dumb, old man.

386
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,411
You were here before us.

387
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,997
No way you didn't notice the heads.

388
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,211
I didn't notice
because I was sitting here.

389
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,756
And I got here moments before you.

390
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:29,885
And you?

391
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,847
I just arrived too.

392
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,434
Look at the scars on the heads.

393
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,355
They must be the Seventh Division soldiers
that American was talking about.

394
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,526
They came here
to look for the tattooed man?

395
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,444
Yeah.

396
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,780
But they were killed instead.

397
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,534
I guess that means…

398
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,373
one of these two is a tattooed convict.

399
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,463
Can't you tell? You were in prison
with the other convicts.

400
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,341
I told you, I didn't meet all of them.

401
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,134
Wait a minute.

402
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,054
I don't know what this is all about,

403
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,973
but perhaps someone came here before us

404
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,102
and killed those two before leaving.

405
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,396
That's just as likely, isn't it?

406
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,485
Shiraishi!

407
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,946
Are you there?

408
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,822
Let us in, quick!

409
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,199
It's them.

410
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,200
Open up!

411
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,284
Sugimoto!

412
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,039
Sugimoto, over here!

413
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,290
Circle to the back!

414
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,257
Three of them, huh?

415
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,885
Steady now, Sugimoto.
Don't make sudden movements.

416
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,056
Get inside quickly!

417
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,433
Go! I'll hold them off.

418
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,563
Throw your belt! Bears hate snakes!

419
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,610
Get over here, Sugimoto!

420
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,736
Jump in!

421
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,868
That was way too close.

422
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,954
It's just as dangerous in here.

423
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,208
Seventh Division soldiers?

424
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,962
One of these two probably did it.

425
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,268
Don't let go!

426
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,062
Asirpa, move!

427
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,617
Are you okay?

428
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,993
Hang in there!

429
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,082
Are you okay? Say something!

430
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,342
We gotta do something about the bears.

431
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,470
Asirpa, where's your bow and arrows?

432
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,307
The bow's broken,
and I dropped my poison arrows.

433
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,767
You're such a klutz.

434
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,394
It's your fault!

435
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,731
Ouch.

436
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,034
How do we take on three bears
without weapons?

437
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,162
Let's deal with our other problem first.

438
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,498
What are your names?

439
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,086
My name is Tatsuya Nakazawa.

440
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,505
Kiichiro Wakayama.

441
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,965
Take off your clothes.

442
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,511
We'll check for tattoos.

443
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,847
If one of them is a convict,
we'll copy his tattoo

444
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,724
and make him retrieve my ammo.

445
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,706
You guys led the bears here.

446
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,251
If you can't clean up your own mess,

447
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,087
I'll cut you up into bear food!

448
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,799
It's a tattoo, a yakuza one.

449
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,136
Hey, mister, listen to me.

450
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,431
I wouldn't fight them if I were you.

451
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:49,310
They fought in the Russo-Japanese War.
They're used to killing people.

452
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,313
So am I.

453
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:58,570
I killed my business rivals
to work my way up the ranks.

454
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,908
Your gun is out of ammo.
Let's see how well you hold up.

455
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,201
Stop it, all of you!

456
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:10,165
There are three bears outside.
Why are we killing each other inside?

457
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,334
We should focus on
getting out of here safely.

458
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,214
She's right.

459
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,634
Let's call a truce.

460
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,223
That said,

461
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,145
someone has to go out there
and retrieve the ammo.

462
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,609
Why don't we decide this fair and square
with a game of even-or-odd?

463
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,527
-Good idea.
-Look who's talking.

464
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,821
Let me inspect the dice.

465
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,628
No signs of tampering.

466
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,754
Of course not.

467
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,259
As for the dice roller…

468
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,804
Mr. Nakazawa, was it?

469
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,057
We'll let him do it to make things fair.

470
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,475
Huh?

471
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,393
You want me to do it?

472
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,479
Hold it, Mr. Nakazawa.

473
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,106
-Take off your clothes.
-Huh?

474
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:22,403
A yakuza boss wouldn't walk around
without his henchmen.

475
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,156
Maybe you work for him.

476
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,167
Well, if you insist.

477
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,720
So… can I put on my clothes now?

478
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,098
How dare you show Asirpa
those disgusting nipples?

479
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,516
Gross as hell.

480
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,226
Your nipples are a joke.

481
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,145
Right…

482
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,149
Shall…

483
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,151
Shall we begin?

484
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,071
Quit playing around and roll the dice.

485
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,741
Oh, I'm sorry.

486
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,076
It's my first time.

487
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,078
You're such an actor.

488
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,416
Shall…

489
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,543
Shall we begin?

490
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,008
<i>He's one of the best dice rollers around.</i>

491
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,021
It's a one-roll bet.

492
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,481
Place your bets!

493
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,651
Leave this to me, the Gambling King.

494
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,569
Even!

495
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,863
Shut up! No way we're leaving it to you.

496
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,780
Odd!

497
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,365
Odd.

498
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,700
Odd.

499
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,119
Then I bet on even.

500
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,000
The loser goes to get the ammo.
Are we agreed?

501
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,668
Yeah.

502
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,004
Game on!

503
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,527
One and six, odd!

504
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,654
Yes!

505
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,238
What the… You idiot!

506
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,452
Huh?

507
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,454
There's a hair attached.

508
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,332
It's a hair-turner.

509
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,044
You use the hair to cheat
by flipping the dice.

510
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,547
You're a professional dice roller.

511
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,634
So he tried to cheat but failed.

512
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,469
No.

513
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,806
You don't make mistakes.

514
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,308
You did it on purpose.

515
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,440
Why do you keep causing trouble for me?

516
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,568
You left those heads there too.

517
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,195
What's wrong with you?

518
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,075
You cheated on me, Boss.

519
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,788
That man I was with in Sapporo?

520
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,042
I told you, he's just a prostitute.

521
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,752
Why can't you let it go?

522
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:30,425
What about Baldy over there?
You were ogling his ass!

523
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,720
No, I wasn't.

524
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,846
You're filthy.

525
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,931
You're a dirty old man.

526
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,727
Shit.

527
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,023
I don't give a damn
about your lovers' spat. Get the ammo.

528
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,400
Keep your promise, <i>Boss</i>.

529
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,153
You're a man… right?

530
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,209
Eat that, you fuckin' bears!

531
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,341
I hope a bear eats your dick!

532
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,804
Shut up!

533
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,599
I should've ditched your ass in Sapporo!

534
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,357
Boss!

535
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,203
Hey, he's a convict!

536
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,081
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
KIICHIRO WAKAYAMA

537
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,797
Boss!

538
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,636
Boss…

539
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,015
Why did you leave me?

540
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,079
Sugimoto!

541
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,043
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

542
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,565
No way I'm getting eaten!

543
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,032
No, please don't!

544
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,826
Shut up and show me your ass.

545
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,248
You only have a yakuza tattoo.

546
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,918
Cover up that filthy ass already.

547
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,879
Gross as hell.

548
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,714
Your ass is a joke.

549
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,343
Boss said I have a nice ass.

550
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,848
He said my nipples are sexy.

551
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,226
Boss…

552
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,607
Who would've thought the tattooed code
would be on his legs?

553
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,278
Probably 'cause he already had
a yakuza tattoo on his torso.

554
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,200
If we don't get out and save him soon,
the bears are gonna…

555
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,913
Come on, don't cry.

556
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,080
It'll be fine.

557
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,960
I bet he got away from those bears.
He wouldn't die that easily.

558
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,507
<i>He's so nice.</i>

559
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,733
I don't see my ammunition pouch.

560
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,236
Maybe a bear took it somewhere.

561
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,406
How do we get out of here without ammo?

562
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,455
I'm sorry about the gambling.

563
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,667
To make up for it,

564
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,337
I have your favorite soft windflowers.

565
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:43,427
I came across 'em in the forest,
so I picked a whole bunch.

566
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,973
Shiraishi.

567
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,892
Those aren't soft windflowers.

568
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,311
What? They're not?

569
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,230
They're <i>surku</i>.

570
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,899
Aconites.

571
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:01,529
Aconites look like soft windflowers
at this time of the year.

572
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,074
So they're poisonous?
You're useless, Shiraishi.

573
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,575
No, we can use it.

574
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,202
You're right.

575
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,705
We can use it on the bears.

576
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,042
We typically use aconite root
to make poison arrows.

577
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,212
But its young leaves are poisonous too.

578
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,473
If we grind them
and add saliva to make a paste,

579
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,268
we have poison.

580
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,857
<i>The Ishikari Numata Horoshin Incident.</i>

581
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,401
<i>In the summer of Taisho 12, 1923,</i>

582
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:45,489
<i>a bear attacked villagers</i>
<i>returning from a festival, killing four.</i>

583
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,700
<i>Of those injured,</i>

584
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:52,955
<i>one had been buried alive by the bear</i>
<i>but lived to tell the tale.</i>

585
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,298
We'll make spears out of farm tools.

586
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,592
Like Ainu poison arrows,

587
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,512
the poisoned tip
is designed to detach inside the body.

588
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,435
We need pine resin to fix the poison,
but we don't have any.

589
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,856
We can melt Shiraishi's candies
and use that instead.

590
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,567
Good idea.
Shiraishi, hand over your candies.

591
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,989
Boss…

592
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,627
The poison is too weak
to kill it right away. Throw another one.

593
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,052
No way! One came in from the roof!

594
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,103
What is it, sir?

595
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,522
Did you find a horse you like?

596
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,023
Feel free to--

597
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,989
You got a lot of nerve,
selling me out to the Seventh Division.

598
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,742
What are you talking about?

599
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,327
I need a weapon.

600
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,289
Bring out the biggest one you have.

601
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,216
Asirpa!

602
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,592
Holy crap!

603
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,179
This is crazy! Stab it, quick!

604
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,597
Guys, listen to me!

605
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,266
It's breaking through!

606
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,730
We can't hold it! Run!

607
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,940
Hurry!

608
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,109
We gotta run!

609
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,820
Boss!

610
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,864
Go, Sugimoto!

611
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,533
Get up! We gotta go!

612
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,249
I'll turn you into mincemeat,
you fuckin' bears!

613
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,669
Hunting bears with a Maxim machine gun?

614
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,505
What a crazy boss!

615
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,009
I can't hold it!

616
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,844
Princess!

617
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,388
Boss!

618
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,057
<i>"Princess"?</i>

619
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,684
<i>"Princess"?</i>

620
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,394
"<i>Princess"?</i>

621
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,856
<i>"Princess"?</i>

622
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,280
Get down, Kiroranke!

623
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,073
Die, you monster!

624
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,921
It's out of ammo.

625
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,549
There's another one!

626
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,884
Get on.

627
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,853
Your country has horseless carriages?

628
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,273
My friend Ford gave me a prototype.

629
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,109
It's coming after us!

630
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,444
Go faster!

631
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,239
Bears usually run faster.
The poison is working.

632
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,160
Princess!

633
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,828
Boss!

634
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,099
Princess!

635
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,312
Princess!

636
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,653
Princess.

637
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,447
Boss.

638
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,407
Princess!

639
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,874
Boss.

640
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,114
You're not getting away.

641
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,786
There goes your anal virginity.

642
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,673
Damn, he actually won.

643
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,477
Serves you right, Boss.

644
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:13,108
Now you can't cheat on me
behind my back anymore.

645
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,279
This makes me

646
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,325
the last man in your life.

647
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,915
You idiot.

648
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,725
I'll go skin him.

649
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,572
I want to make fake tattooed skins.

650
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,700
You'll die if you get involved.

651
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,453
-No one understands me like he does.
-Lt. Tsurumi has the upper hand.

652
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,915
We must find a way to determine
which ones are fake.

653
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:13,293
How dare you kill your comrade!
I know what you're up to.

654
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,837
We can't let them escape.

655
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,923
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

656
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,337
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

657
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,922
