00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>Moocher, moocher, moocher</i>
<i>Mooch, mooch, mooch</i>

2
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>Moocher, moocher, moocher</i>
<i>Mooch, mooch, mooch</i>

3
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>Tanigaki </i>nispa <i>is the king of moochers</i>

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>He relies on Inkarmat for everything</i>

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,908
<i>It's nice to be a mooch</i>
<i>Mooching is the best</i>

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,285
Mooching is bad.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,329
We should earn money to feed ourselves.

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>Tanigaki </i>nispa <i>is a mooch</i>
<i>He has it easy, so very easy</i>

9
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,172
Hey, I just said…

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,720
Look, Cikapasi.

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,847
A bear was here.

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,856
There's an Ainu spell to keep bears away.

13
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,613
Doesn't matter if you're a girl or boy.

14
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,950
Show a bear your crotch,
and it'll run away.

15
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,369
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>,

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,373
will you show your penis
if a bear is about to attack us?

17
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,959
Cikapasi,

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,922
if a bear comes, I'll shoot it with this.

19
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,467
You'll shoot with your penis out?

20
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,219
That's so cool.

21
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,639
No.

22
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,517
I won't show my penis.

23
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>Square, triangular, round</i>

24
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,402
<i>Everyone's penis is different, hey</i>

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,031
<i>Penis, pe-pe-pe-penis</i>

26
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,243
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

27
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,864
Excuse me. Have you seen--

28
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,031
Let me guess.

29
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,868
If I'm right, pay my divination fee.

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,168
What's this?

31
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,004
<i>Ueinkar</i>. Clairvoyance.

32
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,967
You're looking for a woman, right?

33
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,471
You intend to use her to earn money.

34
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,891
That's why she escaped.

35
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,690
So you met Chizuko.

36
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,318
That's how you know.

37
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,822
Damn it.

38
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,909
You think I'm stupid?

39
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,993
Chizuko?

40
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,248
A famous psychic who guessed
the location of a coal seam in Kumamoto.

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,213
We're meeting with a coal mining company
from Yubari, but she ran off.

42
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,551
Whatever.

43
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,431
You'll pose as Chizuko Mizuhashi.

44
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,560
Sounds fun.

45
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,729
I'll do it.

46
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,398
Move.

47
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,361
<i>In the late Meiji era,</i>

48
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>the emergence of psychics claiming to be</i>
<i>clairvoyant or capable of thoughtography</i>

49
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,827
<i>sparked a surge of interest in the occult.</i>

50
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,957
<i>Chizuko Mizuhashi</i>
<i>was one such famous psychic.</i>

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,751
<i>At the request</i>
<i>of a Kumamoto mining company,</i>

52
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,088
<i>she found the Manda coal mine</i>
<i>using her psychic powers</i>

53
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:19,759
<i>and received a reward</i>
<i>equivalent to 20 million yen today.</i>

54
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,639
Stop.

55
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,063
I'll talk to the company directors.

56
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,648
Just nod and play along.

57
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,776
You have the right vibe. They'll buy it.

58
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,320
Pull this off, and I'll pay you.

59
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,741
But I've never divined
the location of a coal seam before.

60
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,743
Just point to the mountains.

61
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,914
Ms. Mizuhashi and Mr. Kawahara?

62
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,332
Yes.

63
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,917
Nice to meet you.

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,463
Sorry to spring this on you,

65
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,719
but could you tell me what's written
on the paper inside this envelope?

66
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,137
Saeki!

67
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,055
They won't mind a small test.

68
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,061
I'm afraid Chizuko can't focus here.

69
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,397
She can't do it with people watching?

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,485
Or is she ashamed
to put on her act in broad daylight?

71
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,657
How dare you.

72
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,536
Did you ask to meet us
just to accuse her of being a fraud?

73
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,413
We're leaving.

74
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,962
What are you doing?

75
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,820
<i>Ihuminu</i>.

76
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,866
My psychic sense
will help find what we seek.

77
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,827
By becoming one with the mountain,

78
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,538
I can sense where to find it with my body.

79
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,170
This way.

80
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,561
Look, Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>.

81
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,941
Aren't those Inkarmat's boobs?

82
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,801
Where are you taking us?

83
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,346
Just point somewhere
and pretend you sense something there.

84
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,099
This way.

85
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,276
Chizuko?

86
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,529
How did you know I was here?

87
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,783
Are you Chizuko Mizuhashi?

88
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,244
Huh?

89
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,913
But aren't you supposed to be…

90
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,710
She must be a replacement.

91
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:46,257
His sister-in-law must've run off
because she didn't like scamming people.

92
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,635
So he looked for a replacement.

93
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,682
I told you these so-called "psychics"
can't be trusted.

94
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,767
What a waste of time.

95
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,685
But…

96
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,276
You think you can just walk away?

97
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,737
Stop it, please!

98
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,155
Shut your mouth!

99
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,785
They left. What now, Mr. Kawahara?

100
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,705
-Tie her up so she can't escape.
-Got it.

101
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,540
We can use her to make money.

102
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,917
Understood.

103
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,763
They have guns. I'm scared.

104
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,557
What do we do? Do we save her?

105
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,185
I don't know.

106
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,649
I can't tell what she's thinking.
I don't trust her.

107
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,445
We're pretending to be family.

108
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,865
Inkarmat is traveling with us.

109
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,742
She's family.

110
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,999
I'm scared, but we gotta help her.

111
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,295
That's right, Cikapasi.

112
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,257
Rise to the occasion and fight.

113
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,593
That's what a boner is about, Cikapasi.

114
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,262
This is

115
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,806
a boner.

116
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,606
What?

117
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,208
That woman is my family.

118
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,754
A single-shot Murata rifle.

119
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,132
Can you kill me in one shot?

120
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,426
Are you okay?

121
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,662
Well, that's enough dicking around.

122
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,123
You came to save me.

123
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,500
You should thank Cikapasi.

124
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,920
He said we have to save you
'cause you're family.

125
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,928
Let's have a nice meal.

126
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,724
My treat.

127
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,352
Awesome!

128
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,104
Excuse me.

129
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,108
Yes, Chizuko?

130
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,529
You're heading east, right?

131
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
Who are you?

132
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,407
You must not go.

133
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,369
You'll be killed

134
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,871
by the man you're chasing.

135
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:33,401
ASAHIKAWA

136
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,569
<i>The Military Capital, Asahikawa.</i>

137
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>The Seventh Division</i>
<i>was stationed in this town</i>

138
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,620
<i>to help defend Hokkaido against</i>
<i>the Russian Empire's southward expansion.</i>

139
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,709
<i>As a result, Asahikawa became</i>
<i>an important hub in North Hokkaido</i>

140
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,044
<i>after Hakodate, Otaru, and Sapporo.</i>

141
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,467
Why is it so busy here?
This town isn't anywhere near the sea.

142
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,970
FINAL EPISODE: MOUNT TAISETSU

143
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:06,016
Asahikawa owes its prosperity
to the Kamikawa Road.

144
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,770
Many men died building that road.

145
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,316
Their bodies lie beneath it
more than you could ever imagine.

146
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,610
Convicts used as slave labor,

147
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,781
<i>forced to work until they died</i>
<i>from the cold, hunger, or bear attacks.</i>

148
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,908
Their only crime was

149
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,954
losing the Boshin War
or Satsuma Rebellion.

150
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,461
They were warriors… arrested for treason.

151
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,178
History is always

152
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,347
written by the winners.

153
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,392
In war,

154
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,562
you can't afford to lose.

155
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,208
The Seventh Division HQ is massive.

156
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,376
How do we find Shiraishi?

157
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,716
We won't be able to check every building.

158
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,763
We'll use the con artist
to make them give us Shiraishi.

159
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,350
Lieutenant Tsurumi won't be fooled
by petty tricks.

160
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,396
He's still in… Otaru.

161
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,818
Kantaro sent a message… to let me know.

162
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,153
<i>The two-bit thug I met at the hideout?</i>

163
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,824
Why is Lieutenant Tsurumi still in Otaru?

164
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,036
He should have come after us
after we clashed in Yubari.

165
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,248
He wants us to collect the tattoos

166
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,292
so he can steal them later.

167
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,170
Don't underestimate him.

168
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,884
He may already have plans
for what comes after finding the gold.

169
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,518
The soldiers who took Shiraishi had
the number 27 on their shoulder patches.

170
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,312
The 27th Infantry Regiment,

171
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,440
one of the four infantry regiments
in Asahikawa.

172
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,360
This is their barracks.

173
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,696
The 27th Regiment?

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,364
What about it?

175
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,866
Seriously?

176
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,076
Are you guys stupid?

177
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,621
I see.

178
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,000
Lieutenant Tsurumi
is in the same regiment.

179
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,297
The 27th Regiment may be secretly
holding Shiraishi without informing HQ.

180
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,677
Lieutenant Tsurumi has
Lt. Colonel Yodogawa under his thumb.

181
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,138
The regimental commander.

182
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,814
SEVENTH DIVISION
27TH REGIMENT HEADQUARTERS

183
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,360
The Abashiri Prison warden
wants to see me?

184
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,029
LIEUTENANT COLONEL TERUCHIKA YODOGAWA

185
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,739
What the hell does he want?

186
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,628
I'm Shirosuke Inudo,
the Abashiri Prison warden.

187
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,296
Nice to meet you.

188
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,133
Inudo.

189
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,887
Could you… introduce us?

190
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,182
This is Sugimoto,
one of the Abashiri Prison guards.

191
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:39,813
Five years ago, a heinous criminal named
Ienaga bit his face off.

192
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,651
He may look unusual,
but he is excellent at his job.

193
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,903
Inudo.

194
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,822
Sorry to hear that.

195
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,033
By the way,

196
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,788
this isn't actually our first meeting.

197
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,461
My apologies.

198
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,213
Could you refresh my memory?

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,971
We met at the funeral of a mutual friend
more than ten years ago.

200
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,975
I'm not surprised you don't remember.

201
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,185
I was just one of many guests.

202
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
Well then,

203
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,247
what brings you here today?

204
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,376
I hear you have Yoshitake Shiraishi.

205
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,921
I'd like you to return him
to Abashiri Prison.

206
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,383
Shiraishi?

207
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,804
There's no one with that name here--

208
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,389
Don't play dumb with me.

209
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,266
Inudo?

210
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,643
Inudo.

211
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:06,066
The Seventh Division soldiers waited
for me to be away from Abashiri Prison.

212
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,822
They moved the convicts without permission
and lost every single one of them.

213
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,368
I hope you realize
I'm cleaning up your mess,

214
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,412
Regimental Commander.

215
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,671
Send word to Lieutenant Tsurumi
in Otaru. Hurry.

216
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,480
Message from Asahikawa.

217
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,233
A man claiming to be the Abashiri Prison
warden wants Shiraishi.

218
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,486
Shirosuke Inudo?

219
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,868
What's the meaning of this?

220
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,997
You want me to sell Shiraishi to you?

221
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,125
No. These are counterfeit notes.

222
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,795
Here's the printing plate.

223
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,970
We confiscated these from Choan Kumagishi,
the master counterfeiter.

224
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,642
We captured him
after he escaped from Kabato.

225
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,190
Do you know what happened
with the Continental currency

226
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,902
or the Austrian counterfeit bills
made by Napoleon?

227
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,865
Flooding enemy markets
with counterfeit money

228
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,828
to sabotage their economy
is a highly effective tactic in war.

229
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:52,923
Choan Kumagishi can make perfect copies
of any currency you desire.

230
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:59,179
I believe a man of his talents
will be useful to the army.

231
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,892
Would you be interested in him?

232
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,358
Let's trade Kumagishi for Shiraishi.

233
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:22,161
Long-distance call to the Seventh Division
27th Regiment HQ in Asahikawa.

234
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
Lieutenant Colonel Yodogawa.

235
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,416
After the Russo-Japanese War,

236
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,671
all the other regimental commanders
were promoted to colonel.

237
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,300
But you're still a lieutenant colonel.

238
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,636
Does that seem fair to you?

239
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,350
This is… your chance to shine.

240
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,853
Inudo.

241
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,231
<i>Tsurumi here.</i>

242
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,067
Don't listen to
Lieutenant Colonel Yodogawa!

243
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,988
Don't let anyone meet Shiraishi.

244
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,366
Send Second Lieutenant Koito!

245
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,334
Second Lieutenant Koito?

246
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,504
This is bad.

247
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,722
What's going on?

248
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,016
Hey…

249
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,352
What's this about?

250
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,272
One of my men is waiting with Kumagishi.

251
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,526
I propose we make the trade outside.

252
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:42,241
I can't afford to take any chances
after what happened at Abashiri Prison.

253
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,492
Very well.

254
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,205
Sugimoto came to get me?

255
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:01,260
SEVENTH DIVISION SECOND LIEUTENANT
OTONOSHIN KOITO

256
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,720
What is it, Second Lieutenant Koito?

257
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:09,268
Lieutenant Colonel Yodogawa,
Lieutenant Tsurumi is on his way here.

258
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,690
I believe he made it quite clear
that no one is allowed to meet Shiraishi.

259
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:21,405
You let a lieutenant tell you what to do,
Lieutenant Colonel Yodogawa?

260
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,574
-Get out! I didn't ask for you.
-Mr. Inudo.

261
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,747
Deek, the waither's gettin' warm.

262
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,499
"Dick"?

263
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,586
Mr. Inudo,

264
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,216
I heard that when you were
the warden at Tsukigata's Kabato Prison,

265
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,219
you met many prisoners from Satsuma.

266
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:49,224
As a result,
you became fluent in Satsuma dialect.

267
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,562
Koito, what are you doing?

268
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,319
Could ye tell us whit ah said?

269
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,208
It gits cauld when the sun goes doon.

270
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,924
Y'ill need a brazier in the morn.

271
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,177
Ah hae one all tae myself.

272
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,642
Hae ye ever tried
Satsuma fried fish cakes?

273
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,395
Goes well wit' a tan o' <i>shochu</i>.

274
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,273
I don't understand what they're saying.

275
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,525
It's nothing like standard Japanese.

276
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,196
Ah hear ye're a tippler.

277
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,450
Ye shuid hae seen me as a laddie.

278
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,623
According to Lieutenant Tsurumi,

279
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,750
Shirosuke Inudo can't drink.

280
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,837
Lieutenant Colonel Yodogawa,
this man just said he's a heavy drinker.

281
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,005
He's an imposter.

282
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,926
How dare they screw with me!

283
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,889
I should've skinned this bastard
as soon as he got here!

284
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,516
Don't kill Shiraishi, sir!

285
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,644
Lieutenant Tsurumi will be angry with me!

286
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,413
-After them!
-Sir!

287
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,919
They have backup?

288
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,380
Ouch.

289
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,548
This way.

290
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,259
Kiroranke has horses for us.

291
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,552
Sugimoto…

292
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,053
Are you okay?

293
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,179
Shut up and run.

294
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,557
-There they are!
-Over here!

295
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,516
After them!

296
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,892
Go!

297
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,856
Corner them!

298
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,735
Get them!

299
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,201
Sugimoto, head south.

300
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,329
We stirred the hornet's nest
with all that shooting.

301
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,998
They shot Sugimoto!

302
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,833
He's immortal. Run or die!

303
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,919
No, there's no way
he can keep running like this!

304
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:23,837
Shiraishi,

305
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,966
if my legs give out, promise me
you'll get Asirpa to Abashiri Prison.

306
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,265
-One of them is injured!
-Sir!

307
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,683
Don't let them escape!

308
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,018
There!

309
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,061
-After them!
-Cut them off!

310
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,856
Go! After them!

311
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,065
This way!

312
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,946
What's that thing?

313
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,824
A Balloon Squadron prototype.

314
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,867
That's it!

315
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,035
Let's steal it.

316
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,086
Don't move!

317
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,463
Get back!

318
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,216
Further back!

319
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,551
Get this thing moving!

320
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,969
-You're nuts!
-Shut up!

321
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,347
Get us up in the air now!

322
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,348
Hurry!

323
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,100
Okay, great. Now get lost!

324
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,108
Does he ever give up?

325
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,362
Give me your bayonet. I'll fight him.

326
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,823
Jigen-ryu sword style from Satsuma.

327
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,244
You won't win with your injuries.

328
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,456
Hyakunosuke Ogata.

329
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,546
You bastard!

330
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,716
How dare you…

331
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,431
How dare you betray Lieutenant Tsurumi!

332
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,226
Ah never liked the cut o' yer jib, ya ken?

333
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,687
Think ah'm just a pampered git, dae ye?

334
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,523
Ye took the piss ahint me back!

335
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:12,487
Yeah, I don't understand a word you said,
Second Lieutenant Koito.

336
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,200
You always start yapping in dialect
when you get all excited.

337
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,245
Ah'll cut ye bastards tae pieces!

338
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,585
Don't block it!

339
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,782
-Stop!
-Get back here!

340
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,951
Sugimoto, get on!

341
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,620
Asirpa!

342
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,390
Sugimoto!

343
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,918
After them!

344
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,965
Ow!

345
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,966
Shiraishi!

346
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,471
Nice meeting ya, Koito!

347
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,144
What the hell is that?

348
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,565
I knew all that shooting had to be them.

349
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,901
They're on that thing.

350
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:36,339
Lieutenant Tsurumi… is gonna be pissed.

351
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,584
One bullet passed through the shoulder.

352
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,711
The other is still in your chest.

353
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,796
We have to remove it.

354
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,760
Why'd you risk your life to save me?

355
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,596
I'm the Escape King, remember?

356
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,682
I could've escaped on my own.

357
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,312
Everyone said to forget about you.

358
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,521
Wait, what?

359
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,232
He was the only one
who wanted to save you.

360
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,152
Aw, you.

361
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:44,657
We'll need your help
when we get to Abashiri Prison.

362
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,620
I decided to save you
because I believed in you.

363
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,124
But then I remembered

364
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,377
the old man at the herring lodge.

365
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,257
What the hell?

366
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,178
Shiraishi,

367
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,056
were you spying for Hijikata?

368
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,144
You told him everything we were doing.

369
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,152
Wait.

370
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,197
See this?

371
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,325
Is that…

372
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:32,455
<i>It's the copy of Kazuo Henmi's tattoo</i>
<i>you gave Ushiyama in Sapporo.</i>

373
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,375
Toshizo Hijikata showed it to me.

374
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,210
I checked it.

375
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,217
You made up a fake tattoo.

376
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,724
You didn't betray us.

377
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,569
You bet I didn't!

378
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,991
I told you.

379
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,495
I'm betting on the both of you.

380
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,123
By the way,

381
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,876
how do we get off this thing?

382
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,085
Ogata?

383
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,837
Ogata!

384
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,641
We should be safe now.

385
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,853
We moved 40 kilometers
east of the barracks.

386
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,397
We rode a large floating balloon.

387
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,399
They know where we are.

388
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,568
Hurry up, or they'll catch us.

389
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,779
What's that?

390
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,699
This is <i>retannoya</i>. Alpine yarrow.

391
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,161
The leaves will help stop the bleeding.

392
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,501
They're here.

393
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,047
They found us.

394
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,091
-Over there!
-We have to go up Mount Taisetsu.

395
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,092
Move it.

396
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,848
Are you serious?

397
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,184
Up that mountain?

398
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,771
MOUNT TAISETSU

399
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:37,205
<i>Mount Taisetsu is a mountain range</i>
<i>with over 20 peaks exceeding 2,000 meters.</i>

400
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:42,877
<i>The highest mountain in Hokkaido,</i>
<i>Mount Asahi, can also be found here.</i>

401
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,817
This is bad.

402
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,360
There's a storm coming.

403
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,779
The wind is freezing.

404
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,864
Like the middle of winter.

405
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,076
Let's turn back and get off the mountain.

406
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,413
Don't be stupid.
There are soldiers chasing us.

407
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,004
The wind's getting stronger.
Looks like rain.

408
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,465
Should we dig a hole in the snow?

409
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,342
Not enough snow for that.

410
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,805
We have to find shelter from the wind
before we die of hypothermia.

411
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,976
Those <i>yuk</i>…

412
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,562
Sugimoto, shoot the males.

413
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,272
The sika deer?

414
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,982
We need a few big ones.

415
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,988
Two in a single shot?

416
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,496
Quick, remove the organs and pelt!
Doesn't have to be perfect.

417
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,807
Do your wounds hurt, Sugimoto?

418
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,895
Don't worry.

419
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,273
I'll be all better by morning.

420
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,611
Suzukawa…

421
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,696
Did he die?

422
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:37,992
Asirpa.

423
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,745
Suzukawa was a bad person.

424
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,540
Bad people are heartless.

425
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,877
They don't feel pain.

426
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,213
You don't have to feel sorry for them.

427
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,591
Don't make excuses.

428
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,720
It's what I told myself.

429
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,973
During the war,

430
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,643
I told myself

431
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,147
the Russians don't suffer when they die.

432
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,781
On the battlefield,

433
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,369
you have to become someone else
if you want to keep fighting.

434
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,966
It was the only way

435
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,718
for us to survive.

436
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,223
Can't you go back

437
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,725
to who you used to be?

438
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,438
Some soldiers did.

439
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:55,862
They went back home,
spent time with family…

440
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,700
and returned to their former selves.

441
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>For the rest of us who survived</i>

442
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,920
<i>but can't go back to who we used to be,</i>

443
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,383
<i>our hearts remain on the battlefield.</i>

444
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,767
Asirpa?

445
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,604
Are you eating something?

446
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,773
Deer liver.

447
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,611
Have some too. You lost a lot of blood.

448
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,957
I'll wait for the wind to let up
before I eat the brain.

449
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,296
You really like eating brains.

450
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,049
What about you?

451
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,967
What do you like besides <i>osoma</i>?

452
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,886
You mean food?

453
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,265
Dried persimmon, I guess.

454
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:07,975
What's that?

455
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,853
Oh, right.

456
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,523
Hokkaido doesn't have persimmon trees.

457
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,450
<i>Persimmons can be bitter and chalky,</i>
<i>so we dry them.</i>

458
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,245
<i>They're very sweet when dried.</i>

459
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,457
I haven't had one in years.

460
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,670
The last time I ate one

461
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,798
was before the war.

462
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,473
You didn't eat it after the war?

463
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,020
Who… are you?

464
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,317
It was spring.

465
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,778
There weren't any.

466
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,494
I see.

467
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,084
Maybe if you eat dried persimmons,

468
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,547
you can go back
to who you were before the war.

469
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,582
When all this is over,

470
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,586
take me to your hometown.

471
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,758
I want to try dried persimmons.

472
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,349
Promise me, Sugimoto.

473
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,191
Sure.

474
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,128
KUSHIRO

475
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:42,922
Here.

476
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:50,763
KUSHIRO POST OFFICE

477
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,682
It's a telegram
informing us of Huci's condition.

478
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,267
From who?

479
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,019
Asirpa's great-uncle.

480
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:01,524
He worked with ethnic Japanese,
so he can read and write a little.

481
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,776
What's it say?

482
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:09,532
"Huci is making <i>raikuru shiyuku</i>."

483
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,369
What's "<i>raikuru shiyuku</i>"?

484
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,372
<i>Raykur shiyuk </i>is a burial garb.

485
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,672
<i>Elderly Ainu who sense</i>
<i>their death approaching</i>

486
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,843
<i>start making their own burial clothes</i>
<i>when their family isn't looking.</i>

487
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,141
There were three <i>nispa </i>with her.

488
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,269
Among them,

489
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,397
there's a man who'll betray Asirpa.

490
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,649
A very dangerous man.

491
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,609
At this rate,

492
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,572
Asirpa's life will be in danger.

493
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,577
Why did you have to say that?

494
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,955
I let them know
the result of my divination.

495
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,300
<i>There's a traitor in Asirpa's midst.</i>

496
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,571
Lieutenant Tsurumi is going to be pissed.

497
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,118
He must've been furious when he heard
I let Yoshitake Shiraishi escape.

498
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,955
How did he react?

499
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,625
Tell me.

500
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,504
-Well--
-Don't tell me! I already know!

501
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,552
Pull yourself together, sir.

502
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,221
-I'm so sorry…
-Look.

503
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,640
I brought what you wanted.

504
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,941
This is great.

505
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,610
Fantastic, Tsukishima!

506
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,489
Lieutenant Tsurumi
doesn't have his scars here.

507
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,325
This was before the Battle of Mukden.

508
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,540
I envy you, Sergeant Tsukishima.

509
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,751
If I'd been born a bit earlier,

510
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,547
I could have fought by his side.

511
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,229
Yes! It's perfect!

512
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,107
Tsukishima, make me some rice glue.

513
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,608
No.

514
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,113
How's this?

515
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,407
Second Lieutenant Koito.

516
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,244
Lieutenant Tsurumi!

517
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,621
Ah'm sorry.

518
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,583
Ah wis haunless
an' let Shiraishi git away.

519
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,837
Ah copied his tat aforehand,
bit ah dinnae expect ye tae forgive--

520
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,754
Calm down.

521
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,258
I can't understand
your rapid-fire dialect.

522
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,676
Breathe and try again.

523
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,811
Ah let Shiraishi git away,
bit ah copied his tat afore!

524
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,564
Still gibberish.

525
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,317
Tsukishima!

526
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,113
Tell him I copied Shiraishi's tattoo
before he got away.

527
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,826
He says he copied Shiraishi's tattoo.

528
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,623
Why can't you speak to me
in standard Japanese, Second Lt. Koito?

529
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,755
I told you not to kill Shiraishi
because he may prove useful to us.

530
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,050
I didn't tell you to give him
to our enemies.

531
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,593
You disappoint me.

532
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,570
Nice.

533
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,822
It looks great on you.

534
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,826
So that's the skin of the convict
who posed as the warden.

535
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:29,249
Yes, this is an unexpected windfall.

536
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,378
Good job, Second Lieutenant Koito.

537
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,466
But you didn't flesh it properly.

538
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,015
I have the following tattooed skins.

539
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,352
Mutsuo Tsuyama's, the first skin I got.

540
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,483
<i>Soroku Funabashi's, the one Edogai had.</i>

541
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:59,196
<i>And the five fake skins</i>
<i>Tsukishima risked his life to bring me.</i>

542
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,533
Second Lieutenant Koito.

543
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,120
You're dismissed from Asahikawa.

544
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,297
You'll join my hunt for the convicts.

545
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,264
I'll do my best.

546
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,600
He says, "I'll do my best."

547
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,108
We should assume

548
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:40,320
that Suzukawa's skin
is now in Lieutenant Tsurumi's hands.

549
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,703
It's a good thing we made a copy.

550
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,718
A merchant says
he may have seen Sugimoto's group.

551
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,803
Kiroranke went after them.

552
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,223
I see why he's "Immortal Sugimoto."

553
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,309
So he survived.

554
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,772
We have Ienaga's tattoo…

555
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,196
Ushiyama's,

556
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,743
<i>and Tetsuo Takarai's,</i>
<i>a gift from Hyakunosuke Ogata.</i>

557
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,287
We still don't know…

558
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,125
whether this is real or fake.

559
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,087
Well then…

560
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,718
what's our next move?

561
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,430
So <i>hinna</i>.

562
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,974
<i>Hinna</i>.

563
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,817
According to Suzukawa,
there's a convict in Kushiro.

564
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,655
How many more tattoos to go
before we find the gold?

565
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,992
We currently have seven tattoos.

566
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:15,582
<i>The first skin I got was Takechiyo Goto's,</i>
<i>the man I met while panning for gold.</i>

567
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,292
My next tattoos

568
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:22,172
came from Shiraishi the Escape King
and Kanjiro Kasahara.

569
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,261
Then there's Tetsuzo Nihei,
who gave his gun to Tanigaki.

570
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,557
<i>Kazuo Henmi,</i>
<i>who we met at a herring lodge in Otaru.</i>

571
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,936
<i>Kiichiro Wakayama,</i>
<i>who killed a bear with a sword.</i>

572
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,689
We also have a copy of Suzukawa's tattoo.

573
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,151
<i>Lieutenant Tsurumi</i>
<i>must have Suzukawa's skin by now.</i>

574
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,365
I wonder how many tattoos they have.

575
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,209
Why can't you say "<i>hinna</i>," Ogata?

576
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,963
Will you say it for your favorite food?

577
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,431
Hey!

578
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:26,820
Tanigaki sent a telegram from Kushiro
to the old Ainu woman.

579
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,156
They caught up with Sugimoto's group.

580
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,115
Excellent.

581
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,118
Then it's time for us to go

582
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,746
to Abashiri.

583
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,715
<i>We'll go to Abashiri</i>
<i>and meet Sugimoto's group there.</i>

584
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,098
KUSHIRO

585
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,990
ABASHIRI PRISON

586
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:30,258
ABASHIRI PRISON WARDEN
SHIROSUKE INUDO

587
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,751
GOLDEN KAMUY

588
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:48,480
END OF PART ONE

589
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,435
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

590
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,978
