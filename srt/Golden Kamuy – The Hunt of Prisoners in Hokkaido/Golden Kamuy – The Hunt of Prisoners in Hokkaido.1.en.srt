1
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:21,604
HOKKAIDO
MEIJI ERA (1868 - 1912)

2
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>Somewhere in Hokkaido</i>

3
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,247
<i>lies a hidden treasure trove of Ainu gold.</i>

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,169
203 METER HILL

5
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,841
I'm… Immortal Sugimoto!

6
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,263
<i>Saichi Sugimoto, a soldier</i>
<i>who survived the Russo-Japanese War.</i>

7
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,391
Take care of… Umeko.

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,934
Let's go to Hokkaido.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,771
They have gold there.

10
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,065
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

11
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,358
I want Ume's eyes to heal.

12
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,737
There's an interesting story.

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,781
It involves gold.

14
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,866
With tattoos.

15
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,992
<i>The man tells Sugimoto</i>

16
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,538
<i>that the tattoos on the convicts</i>
<i>who escaped Abashiri Prison</i>

17
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>show where the Ainu gold is hidden.</i>

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,375
I said too much.

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,715
So you're one of the convicts
in the story.

20
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:41,893
<i>After obtaining his first tattoo</i>
<i>from Goto, one of the convicts,</i>

21
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>Sugimoto meets Asirpa, a young Ainu girl.</i>

22
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,065
I'm Saichi Sugimoto.

23
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,149
Asirpa.

24
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,988
<i>I'll find out why my </i>aca <i>had to be killed.</i>

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,157
<i>I'll find the truth.</i>

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,493
<i>The culprit is still alive in prison.</i>

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,123
<i>Finding the gold</i>
<i>means getting revenge for your father.</i>

28
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,627
<i>With their goals aligned,</i>

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,796
<i>the two set out to find the tattoos.</i>

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,634
I heard there are 24 of us
with the tattoos.

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,386
Asirpa is back!

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,434
<i>But Sugimoto and Asirpa weren't</i>
<i>the only ones looking for the gold.</i>

33
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,437
Are you going to try to create
a Republic of Ezo in Hokkaido again?

34
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,608
<i>Toshizo Hijikata had been gathering</i>
<i>the escaped convicts.</i>

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,821
Our war is not over yet.

36
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,366
<i>The Seventh Division, led by Tsurumi,</i>

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,494
<i>wanted to create a military government.</i>

38
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,122
We're going to fight the Seventh Division.

39
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,875
Toshizo Hijikata!

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,588
<i>The two factions joined the hunt,</i>

41
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,048
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

42
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,270
Whatever the situation,
he'll never give up.

43
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,272
He'll find a way to survive
no matter what.

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,150
That's why he's Immortal Sugimoto.

45
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,153
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

46
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,120
You have a purpose…
as long as you are alive.

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,664
We will find the gold.

48
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,125
Yeah.

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:36,090
<i>Twenty-four vicious convicts</i>
<i>scattered across Hokkaido.</i>

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,844
<i>Twenty-four tattoos to collect.</i>

51
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,722
<i>The hunt has already begun.</i>

52
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:53,816
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

53
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,582
I missed its vitals.

54
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,583
Let's chase it.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
We have to hurry.

56
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,929
I agree.

57
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,391
The liver becomes inedible
if the deer runs about injured.

58
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,102
-The meat won't be as tasty.
-That's not what I mean.

59
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,938
The brain and eyeballs
will still be delicious.

60
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,273
Don't worry.

61
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,783
The tracks are erratic.

62
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,035
It must be very weak now.

63
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,344
It's hiding under that tree.

64
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,682
If we flush it out,
it'll run to the nearest tree for cover.

65
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,144
Stay downwind and circle around.

66
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,646
Move quietly and hide among those trees.

67
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,148
Got it.

68
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,194
I won't prolong its suffering.
I'll kill it in one shot.

69
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:20,755
EPISODE 1: THE LEGENDARY BEAR HUNTER

70
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,613
My <i>matagi </i>father
used a Murata rifle like yours.

71
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,533
It can only hold one bullet at a time.

72
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,161
You call it a personal preference.

73
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,414
I call it obsolete.

74
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,707
Stay out of this, soldier boy.

75
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,460
Okay.

76
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:01,963
Go, Ryu!

77
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,221
If you don't kill it in one shot,
you're dead.

78
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,698
Look at her face.

79
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,285
She would've become a man-eater someday.

80
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,454
Why are you so sure?

81
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,748
Her womb shows she's never had cubs.

82
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,792
Bears like her

83
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,087
become increasingly aggressive over time.

84
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,341
Female bears are scarier than male bears.

85
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,471
Just like humans, eh?

86
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,351
A medicine seller in my hometown
once told me

87
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,480
the name of the top bear hunter
in Hokkaido.

88
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,984
Tetsuzo Nihei.

89
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,278
That's your name.

90
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,871
Why are you following me,
Tanigaki the <i>matagi</i>?

91
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,710
I saved you when you were injured,
but that doesn't mean I want a lover.

92
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,087
Enough with the wisecracks.

93
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,090
I know you're after it too.

94
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,135
The white wolf.

95
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,517
You've never fought a wolf, have you?

96
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:44,232
An injured animal like you
won't last two seconds against it.

97
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,860
Have <i>you </i>ever hunted a wolf?

98
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,945
Nope!

99
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,073
That's why I want to go up against one.

100
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,244
Wolves were killing livestock.

101
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,373
So humans laid traps
and drove them to extinction.

102
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,084
In that battle of wits,

103
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,629
one wolf survived
to be the last of its kind.

104
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,516
My hunter's soul is getting a boner!

105
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,187
What is he doing?!

106
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,410
Retar, keep it pinned down.

107
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,502
Why didn't you shoot?

108
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,385
It looked right at me,
and I saw it was determined to live.

109
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,597
I couldn't move.

110
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,059
That deer is me.

111
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,957
If you can't see it through to the end,

112
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
don't shoot at all.

113
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,257
Put your hands in there.

114
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,012
-In its belly?
-Yes.

115
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,986
Well?

116
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,449
It's hot.

117
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,119
My numb hands are warming up.

118
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,708
The heat from its body
is warming you up, giving you life.

119
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,836
We'll eat its meat, as will other animals.

120
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,173
The rest will feed
the trees, the grass, the land itself.

121
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177
The deer didn't die in vain.

122
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,774
Shall we eat it?

123
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
Yes, let's.

124
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,612
Sugimoto, hold the leg.

125
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,239
Okay.

126
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,998
We'll give it to Retar.

127
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,716
He's acting strange.

128
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,805
He senses danger.

129
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,348
Someone's coming.

130
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,310
The Seventh Division?

131
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,771
You can go, Retar.

132
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,234
Let's take what we can and leave.

133
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,570
Retar will come back and eat the rest.

134
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,196
Yeah.

135
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,303
That gunshot came from a Type 30 rifle,
the same as mine.

136
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,764
Look, Tanigaki.

137
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,349
Wolf tracks.

138
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,731
But the wolf didn't eat the carcass.

139
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,109
Did hunters steal it
after the wolf killed it?

140
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,740
Tracks from boots and deerskin shoes.

141
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,784
It's those two.

142
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,997
I can't see their faces,
but one of them is a soldier.

143
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,917
They don't seem
interested in following us.

144
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,127
Maybe they're just hunters.

145
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,470
Is it the Ainu girl? The one who was there
when you were attacked?

146
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,265
The wolf isn't afraid of the girl.

147
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,397
I bet they left
the rest of the deer for it.

148
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,693
The wolf might return.

149
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,699
We should fill our bellies
before we battle the wolf.

150
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,579
There we go! Dinner's ready!

151
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,834
Nihei-style roast heart!

152
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,927
Delicious!

153
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,097
Tastes of blood with every bite.

154
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,351
Eating fresh heart is a privilege
only hunters get to enjoy.

155
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,897
Nihei-style blood sausage.

156
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,663
You don't talk much.

157
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,583
Can't shake the <i>matagi </i>habit, eh?

158
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,255
I heard you aren't allowed
to sneeze or cough in the mountains.

159
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,551
We <i>matagi </i>don't prattle on
about our way of life.

160
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,513
Why do you still wear that army cap?

161
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,437
You can go home and be a <i>matagi </i>again.
So why haven't you?

162
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,698
I… had my reasons for staying in the army.

163
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,914
I was prepared to leave Akita,
my hometown, behind.

164
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,425
<i>But… as I spent time in the mountains,</i>

165
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,973
<i>I felt something change within me,</i>
<i>like poison seeping away.</i>

166
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,314
"Be born anew in the next world

167
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>and hear only good things."</i>

168
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,781
<i>It's what we </i>matagi <i>say</i>
<i>to guide bear spirits to the afterlife.</i>

169
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,828
I wasn't able to say it…

170
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,916
for those I killed in the war.

171
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,394
So hunting that wolf is just an excuse.

172
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,564
You can't go back to the army
or your hometown.

173
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,484
Your hunter's spirit

174
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,446
wanders aimlessly
through the Hokkaido forests.

175
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,954
Listen, Tanigaki.

176
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,374
After we kill the wolf,

177
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,085
take its pelt

178
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,337
and go home.

179
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,702
Boner!

180
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,750
Tanigaki.

181
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,254
Let's scrub backsies.

182
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,883
What?

183
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,066
You're back! What took you so long?

184
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,193
It's just Shiraishi.

185
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,154
What did you find out about the tattoos?

186
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,239
What's the rush?

187
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,282
Hey!

188
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,909
Did you catch a deer?

189
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,369
Looks like I came at the right time.

190
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,123
Look what I brought.

191
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,127
Fresh deer meat and delicious sake.

192
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
We're having a feast tonight!

193
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,549
Yes, excellent timing.

194
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,717
Yeah.

195
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,270
Here.

196
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,730
The brain.

197
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>Hinna</i>.

198
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,571
Shiraishi.

199
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,916
Deer <i>citatap </i>is called <i>sewri</i>.

200
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,836
We use the deer's windpipe.

201
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,920
Windpipe?

202
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,675
But what about the meat?

203
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,302
Shut up, Shiraishi! Just chop it!

204
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,762
Really?

205
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,768
Not like that!

206
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,483
I wanna eat meat.

207
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,694
Say "<i>citatap</i>"!

208
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,947
Are you drunk already, Asirpa?

209
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:22,369
<i>Citatap.</i>

210
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,914
Since Shiraishi won't stop whining,
you guys can eat the loin.

211
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,624
It's the best part.

212
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,336
To cater to you <i>maciya orunpe</i>
sheltered city boys,

213
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,589
I salted and roasted it.

214
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,302
It's good.

215
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,352
Sugimoto, there's some <i>citatap </i>left.

216
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,562
Finish it.

217
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,066
I'm stuffed.

218
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,776
What?

219
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,903
How dare you!

220
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,245
The way the deer ran for its life.

221
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,624
The warmth of its organs,
the taste of its flesh.

222
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,752
All proof that the deer was alive.

223
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,880
Eat everything and forget nothing!

224
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,971
If I die,

225
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,310
can I count on you to never forget me?

226
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,394
What?

227
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,022
If <i>you </i>die?

228
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
Don't die, Sugimoto.

229
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,826
Don't die.

230
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,331
I'm immortal!

231
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,919
You hear that? He's immortal, Asirpa!

232
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,340
That reminds me.

233
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,468
Let me tell you what I found out.

234
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,139
I heard this from a fur trader.

235
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,812
Several years ago, a man was arrested
for killing three people.

236
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,649
That man suddenly reappeared in Otaru.

237
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,236
He's one of the escaped convicts.

238
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,363
What's he like?

239
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,159
His skills as a hunter are unmatched.

240
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,287
Do you know what they referred to him as?

241
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,125
<i>"He who makes</i>
<i>hibernating bears tremble in fear."</i>

242
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,713
<i>"Every bear's worst nightmare,</i>
<i>Tetsuzo Nihei."</i>

243
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,675
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
TETSUZO NIHEI

244
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,926
That tattoo…

245
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,721
You're one of the convicts!

246
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,434
Just so you know,
it's just shrunk from the cold air.

247
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,853
It's usually a lot bigger.

248
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,773
You have a lot of nerve cracking jokes
after killing those soldiers.

249
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:02,321
They were blinded by greed
and just as ready to kill us.

250
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,781
I'd rather shed a tear

251
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,285
for the animals I kill.

252
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,539
Are you gonna shoot me, skin me,

253
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,625
and return to the army?

254
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,338
Tanigaki the soldier.

255
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,507
Tanigaki the <i>matagi</i>.

256
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,511
Which one are you now?

257
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,560
Tetsuzo Nihei?

258
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,104
I know that name.

259
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,398
You've heard of him?

260
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,651
A group of bandits
had been robbing hunters.

261
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,489
<i>But their luck ran out</i>

262
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,991
<i>when they picked the wrong man to rob.</i>

263
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,764
<i>I hunted down the men</i>
<i>who tried to take my kill,</i>

264
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,766
<i>and I beat them to death.</i>

265
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,519
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

266
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,271
<i>when I got to the last robber…</i>

267
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,568
<i>I was caught by the police.</i>

268
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,073
That's how you ended up
in Abashiri Prison?

269
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,451
I wanted to die in the mountains,
so I escaped.

270
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,122
One day, I'll fall in battle.

271
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,833
The animals will tear my body apart.

272
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,129
I'll be excreted as animal feces
and become part of the mountain.

273
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,425
There's no better death.

274
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,138
You understand, don't you?

275
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,811
You're a <i>matagi</i>, after all.

276
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,115
What else did you find out?

277
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,158
What?

278
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,367
Well…

279
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,120
Now that you mention it,

280
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,832
he asked the fur trader a question.

281
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,210
"How much would you pay
for a white wolf's pelt"?

282
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,547
It's not us he's after.

283
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,300
It's Retar.

284
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,270
If the wolf leaves the deer for too long,
birds and foxes will pick it clean.

285
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,106
It should return tonight.

286
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,484
We'll keep watch in shifts.

287
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,449
Ryu's scared of the wolf.
He's only good as a hot-water bottle.

288
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,536
Keep us warm, Ryu.

289
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,212
Hey.

290
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,340
Why do I have to come along?

291
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,760
You're the only one
who can identify Nihei.

292
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,305
Hurry. We'll catch the convict
and keep Retar safe.

293
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,228
We've been played.

294
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,312
Wolf feces.

295
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,814
That's why the foxes stayed away.

296
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,986
We were tricked into watching over
wolf shit the whole night.

297
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,158
"The shadowing wolf."

298
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:40,205
It's what they call wolves
that shadow and watch strangers.

299
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,749
That must be what it's doing.

300
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,921
It's been observing us the entire time.

301
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,802
My boner is out of control.

302
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,852
What else do you know
about shadowing wolves?

303
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,606
My father once told me

304
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,067
that if a wolf is stalking you,

305
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,654
you should drop one of your belongings
to make it stop following you.

306
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,572
Really?

307
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:18,243
Wolves are naturally curious.
They'll investigate what you dropped.

308
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,169
It stinks.

309
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,589
What did you burn?

310
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,090
The wolf shit.

311
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,970
I want to annoy the wolf
so it doesn't lose interest in us.

312
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,976
This is a smoke signal fit for a wolf.

313
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,155
That's where we killed the deer.

314
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,600
The wolf should be following Tanigaki.

315
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,727
It hasn't noticed me.

316
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,025
There it is.

317
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,277
Show me your head.

318
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,642
Toss your gun over here.

319
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,773
So that's why the wolf was on guard.

320
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,943
It sensed your bloodlust.

321
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,155
Are you sure that's him?

322
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,700
Yeah, I'm sure.

323
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
That's Tetsuzo Nihei.

324
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,287
Shiraishi?

325
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,541
I see.

326
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,753
So you're after my tattoo.

327
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,923
I can shoot you five times

328
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,426
before you're done reloading.

329
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,304
How about a little game?

330
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,684
Let's see which one of us
leaves this mountain alive.

331
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,812
I'm immortal.

332
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,068
Attaboy, Hot-Water Bottle!

333
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,070
Whoa!

334
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,590
I hope you're ready to become animal shit.

335
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,347
Ouch!

336
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,015
Let go, you stupid mutt!

337
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,233
Don't move!

338
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,865
You bastard.

339
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,452
You dare use her as a shield?!

340
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,914
Get away from her!

341
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,333
Stay back!

342
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,134
Coward!

343
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,972
Real men don't take
innocent children hostage.

344
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,473
You're not fooling me.

345
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,101
She had tattooed skins on her
last time we met.

346
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,436
I don't believe she's innocent.

347
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,773
I'm not worth as much to him as you think.

348
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,024
He'll shoot you.

349
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,235
Is it worth it?

350
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,113
She's bluffing.

351
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,699
Women are scary, Tanigaki.

352
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,910
She can get caught in the crossfire
for all I care!

353
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,342
Shiraishi.

354
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,595
Sorry.

355
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,555
Put the gun down.

356
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,265
Sugimoto.

357
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,979
I knew this would happen.

358
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,732
Shiraishi…

359
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,609
Don't make her watch.

360
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,486
Take her far away.

361
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,824
Fine.

362
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,880
Take her away.

363
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,341
We don't want her to hear their screams.

364
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,053
Stop it!

365
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,346
Don't kill them!

366
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,764
Sugimoto!

367
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,223
Shiraishi!

368
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,280
The Escape King.

369
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,700
I completely forgot.

370
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,044
Tanigaki! They escaped!

371
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,796
Sugimoto!

372
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,446
Stop squirming!

373
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,493
Stop! There's an <i>amappo </i>here!

374
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,004
We set Ainu trap bows
in valleys where deer pass.

375
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,052
The poisoned arrowhead
is still inside you.

376
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,889
We have to act quickly. Untie me.

377
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,477
Hurry!

378
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,657
To save you, I have to remove
the flesh around the wound.

379
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,242
Fine.

380
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,994
Do it.

381
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,256
Hold it!

382
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,300
Wait!

383
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,052
I said wait!

384
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,430
We can't win without weapons.

385
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,682
Let's fall back for now.

386
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,353
What's the rush? He won't kill Asirpa!

387
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,396
Wait up!

388
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,116
Let's stop this.

389
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,660
We didn't come here to kill.

390
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,999
Wait here, Tanigaki.

391
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,755
I'll use the girl…

392
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,843
to lure the wolf to me.

393
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,399
Let me go!

394
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,693
Retar is the last wolf.

395
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,030
Killing him means
the <i>horkew kamuy </i>will be extinct!

396
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,908
Wolves are as good as extinct.

397
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,702
Their population will never recover.

398
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,873
Perfect.

399
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,417
I have a clear view here.

400
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,843
You're one scary little girl.

401
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,303
I can't let my guard down around you.

402
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,557
Are you that desperate for money?
It's not worth it!

403
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,017
I don't care about money.

404
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,521
I just want to be the last hunter

405
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,023
the Ezo wolf sees before it dies.

406
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,860
Retar is strong and clever.

407
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,570
You won't win.

408
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,906
I don't want Retar to be a <i>wen kamuy</i>.

409
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,915
So you believe animals that kill humans
become evil gods and go to hell.

410
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,626
Don't worry.

411
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,130
Human life isn't worth that much.

412
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,759
This is a fight to the death
between beasts.

413
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,387
Only one will survive,

414
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,472
and that's me.

415
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,342
It really came.

416
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,011
And it's charging straight at me!

417
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,689
Magnificent!

418
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,233
Retar, stay away!

419
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,735
Bring it!

420
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,752
I win.

421
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,805
Good boy, Ryu.

422
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,975
Not bad for a hot-water bottle.

423
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,940
Your mate, huh?

424
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,570
It should've been… a duel between us men,

425
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,989
but your wife didn't give a damn.

426
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,623
I was right.

427
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,918
Women really are scary.

428
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,426
Asirpa!

429
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,637
Sugimoto!

430
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,265
You okay, Asirpa?

431
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,225
Retar's wife saved me.

432
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,143
Wife?

433
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,903
Another wolf's howl?

434
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,575
Cubs.

435
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,079
Asirpa, look. Wolf cubs.

436
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,710
Retar,

437
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,088
you have a family.

438
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,756
Be born anew in the next world…

439
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,928
and hear only good things.

440
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,565
The <i>udo </i>stem decoction
will help prevent infection.

441
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,859
Stay strong.

442
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,114
Some of my Ainu friends fought in the war
as members of the Seventh Division.

443
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,159
They told me how tough you soldiers are.

444
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,328
I'm sure you'll recover.

445
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,292
Let's go.

446
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,397
Asirpa, are you sure you wanna save him?

447
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,526
I can't just leave him to die.

448
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,239
If my partner wants to save him,
I won't interfere.

449
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,575
If he tries anything funny,

450
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,411
he'll have to deal with me.

451
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,293
Eat as much as you like.

452
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:32,007
Salmon <i>ruype</i>.
It's only available in the winter.

453
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,551
<i>Ruype</i>?

454
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,762
Delicious!

455
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,099
The half-frozen texture is interesting.

456
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,563
It melts in your mouth. It's delicious.

457
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,276
Raw meat and fish are hung from trees
and left to freeze.

458
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,861
<i>Ruype </i>means "thawed food."

459
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,281
Makes sense.

460
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:59,493
It's cold here, so it's only natural
to serve and eat frozen food.

461
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,418
It's thanks to the fish of the Gods

462
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,923
that we are able to survive.

463
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,135
But one day,

464
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,723
the fish of the Gods
stopped swimming upstream for us.

465
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:26,895
They stopped coming
because men had tainted the water

466
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,774
in their search for gold.

467
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,193
What did she say?

468
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,113
It's an <i>upaskuma, </i>an oral tradition.

469
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,281
It's about salmon.

470
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,327
Long ago, our men searched for gold
in the river, polluting it.

471
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,370
The salmon stopped coming.

472
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,335
"This went on for many years."

473
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,340
"With no salmon to catch,
life became difficult."

474
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,805
"The same thing happened
in Shizunai, Tokachi, Kushiro,

475
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,807
and elsewhere."

476
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,605
"The village representatives
gathered the gold in one place."

477
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,570
<i>"The Ainu held a council</i>
<i>and decided to stop mining gold."</i>

478
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,866
<i>"The gold was hidden</i>
<i>so no one could fight over it."</i>

479
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,535
<i>"No one was allowed to talk about it."</i>

480
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,042
"Eventually, everyone involved grew old."

481
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,961
"The location of the gold was lost to all

482
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,173
except for an old man from this village."

483
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,636
And that old man was killed by Noppera-Bo.

484
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,391
<i>So that's the story</i>
<i>behind the hidden gold.</i>

485
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,769
I've never heard this <i>upaskuma </i>before.

486
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,023
If what granny says is true,

487
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,776
that means Noppera-Bo wasn't lying

488
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,697
when he told us convicts
there's 200 kan of gold to be found.

489
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,699
It isn't 200 kan.

490
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,287
<i>The lieutenant leading our group</i>
<i>is an intelligence officer.</i>

491
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,915
<i>He analyzed the information we had</i>

492
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,376
<i>and calculated the exact amount of gold.</i>

493
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,378
<i>Lieutenant Tsurumi?</i>

494
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,758
The 200 kan figure was false information
spread by Noppera-Bo.

495
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,220
So what's the actual amount?

496
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,181
Lieutenant Tsurumi thinks

497
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,475
it's 100 times more.

498
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,144
20,000 kan.

499
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,650
20,000 kan.

500
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,027
20,000 kan of gold.

501
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,989
That explains why

502
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,577
the Seventh Division and Hijikata's gang
are hell-bent on finding it.

503
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,830
Talk about raising the stakes.

504
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,540
Hey, you.

505
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,168
Where was Noppera-Bo caught?

506
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,336
Lake Shikotsu.

507
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,132
<i>He tried to escape</i>
<i>on an Ainu fisherman's canoe,</i>

508
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,216
<i>but it capsized.</i>

509
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,720
They say the canoe capsized

510
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,806
because he was carrying some of the gold.

511
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,730
I don't know your reason
for wanting the gold.

512
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:21,570
But I'm sure it doesn't compare
to the burden the lieutenant bears.

513
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,837
Charge!

514
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,300
<i>Imperial General HQ wanted to capture</i>
<i>Port Arthur as soon as possible.</i>

515
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,679
<i>So we advanced,</i>
<i>using our fallen comrades as shields.</i>

516
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,891
<i>We destroyed the machine guns</i>
<i>and took 203 Meter Hill.</i>

517
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,557
10,000 Seventh Division soldiers
were deployed.

518
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,854
By the time we took 203 Meter Hill,
less than half remained.

519
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,566
After we returned from the war,

520
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:27,404
the government treated the division
like outcasts and second-rate soldiers.

521
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,368
Lieutenant Tsurumi didn't approve
of the reckless strategy

522
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,828
used at 203 Meter Hill.

523
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,749
But he had to follow orders.

524
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,672
He plans to create a new government
in Hokkaido, right?

525
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:50,761
The incompetency of the Imperial HQ
forced us to break through the front line

526
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,388
with our comrades as shields
against the Maxim guns.

527
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,890
It was the same for you.

528
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,768
We risked our lives on the battlefield

529
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,687
but returned home to life as vagabonds.

530
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,065
Were we rewarded in any way?

531
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,822
What's the situation with the tattoos?

532
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,785
That creepy lieutenant has one.
I saw it myself.

533
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:23,168
<i>Hijikata seems to have teamed up</i>
<i>with Ushiyama, a fellow convict,</i>

534
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,252
<i>so they have two.</i>

535
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,173
<i>As for us,</i>

536
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,425
<i>we have the tattoo Sugimoto found,</i>

537
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,344
<i>Kasahara's,</i>

538
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,346
<i>Nihei's,</i>

539
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,181
<i>and mine.</i>

540
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,433
<i>That's four tattoos.</i>

541
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,936
We're ahead for now.

542
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,313
But to decipher the code,

543
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:48,068
we need to steal the tattoos that
the Seventh Division and Hijikata possess.

544
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,322
We'd be risking our lives
hunting for the gold.

545
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,449
It'll be fine.

546
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,285
Asirpa knows Hokkaido
like the back of her hand.

547
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,164
We also have Immortal Sugimoto.

548
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,458
Don't forget the Escape King.

549
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,046
We'll be the ones

550
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,132
to find the gold.

551
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,250
Our fifth tattoo, huh?

552
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,334

553
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,545
He's amazing.

554
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,422
It's fate.

555
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,424
Be our spy.

556
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,384
I'm not gonna die.

557
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,261
After resisting with all my strength,

558
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,847
I want to be killed.

559
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,475
Sugimoto!

560
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,435
I'm immortal!

561
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,307
