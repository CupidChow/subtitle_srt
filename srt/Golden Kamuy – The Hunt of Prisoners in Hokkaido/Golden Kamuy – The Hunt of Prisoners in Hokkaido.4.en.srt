00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,472
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:18,893
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

203 METER HILL

00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,607
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:30,155
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,323
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>With the help of Asirpa,</i>
<i>a young Ainu girl,</i>

8
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,873

<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

9
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,500
-We will find the gold.
-Yeah.

An old friend of my <i>aca</i>.

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,215
I know about what happened
in Abashiri Prison.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,800
Noppera-Bo

14
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,886
is Asirpa's father.

15
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,221
I'm going to meet Noppera-Bo.

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,683
I want to see with my own eyes
whether Noppera-Bo is Aca.

<i>After obtaining Henmi's tattoo in Otaru,</i>

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>Hijikata's group has three</i>

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,004
<i>The Seventh Division has one.</i>

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,298
<i>Sixteen tattoos left.</i>

24
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:35,470

BARATO

29
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,781
-What do we do now?
-Hell if I know!

30
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,741
I'll get a job in Sapporo.

31
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,076
-What?
-Lend me some money.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,202
I don't have any!

33
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,504
You there.

34
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,717
Give us your money and scram.

35
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,839
What's with that sword?

36
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,634
Aren't you too old to be playing samurai?

37
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,386
Move, you useless geezers.

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,806
We're in a hurry!

39
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,450
Listen up, boy.

40
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,372
There are no useless geezers,
only survivors.

41
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,048
Are you the yakuza of Barato?

42
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,426
We heard the Hidoro family

43
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,889
recently got their hands
on some human skin with a strange tattoo.

44
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,641
Is it true?

45
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,561
Answer your elders.

46
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,322
A man left it as collateral after losing
a lot of money at the gambling den.

47
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,450
He said the tattooed skin

48
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,663
shows the location of Ainu buried gold.

49
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,961
We should've brought Ushiyama with us
instead of sending him on that errand.

50
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,549
The Hidoro family runs a gambling den
in this dingy post town.

51
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,970
It's not a big outfit, but they do have
around 20 men working for them.

52
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,764
We have two Shinsengumi members.

53
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,475
That's more than enough.

54
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,437
The Hidoro family

55
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,441
has been… wiped out.

56
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,843
No signs of resistance.

57
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,429
Shot from a distance.

58
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,599
Killed with a single shot,
every one of them.

59
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,352
Impressive shooting.

60
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,148
Wait here.

61
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,359
Okay.

62
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,900
Finders keepers.

63
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,949
The Seventh Division.
Are you one of Lt. Tsurumi's men?

64
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,284
I don't work for him anymore.

65
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,371
I'm looking for the gold on my own.

66
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,960
You could've shot us in the head
as we approached.

67
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,923
You wouldn't have gone down that easily…

68
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,761
Mr. Toshizo Hijikata.

69
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,514
What do you want?

70
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:17,520
Rumors of this tattooed skin led me here.

71
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,940
Then I realized you two
wanted the skin too.

72
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,733
So I waited.

73
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,495
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
TETSUO TAKARAI

74
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,499
How would you like to hire

75
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,169
a skilled bodyguard?

76
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,321
We're finally here.

77
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,036
SAPPORO

78
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>Sapporo was designed</i>
<i>to serve as a central hub</i>

79
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,250
<i>for the development</i>
<i>of the northern region.</i>

80
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,712
<i>Although it wasn't as populated as Otaru,</i>

81
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:28,591
<i>Sapporo grew rapidly due to military needs</i>
<i>during the Russo-Japanese War.</i>

82
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,178
AKEBOSHI GUN SHOP

83
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,680
You want me to recommend an inn?

84
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,352
There's an event going on
at Nakajima Amusement Park right now.

85
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,648
Some kind of fair or exhibition
of Hokkaido products.

86
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,484
All the inns are full.

87
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,825
Asirpa, put that down.

88
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,664
I just remembered.

89
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,960
There's a Western-style hotel
on the outskirts of the city.

90
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,588
A woman runs it all by herself.

91
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,301
I heard she's very beautiful.

92
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,348
Everyone's talking about it.

93
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,687
What's the name of the hotel? Tell me.

94
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,987
<i>Sapporo World Hotel.</i>

95
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,489
<i>That's what it's called.</i>

96
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,993
SAPPORO WORLD HOTEL

97
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,508
Welcome, sir.

98
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,553
I'm Ienaga, the owner of this hotel.

99
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,023
I'll show you to your room.

100
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,899
EPISODE 4:
LET'S ALL STAY AT THE MURDER HOTEL!

101
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,568
Are you here to sightsee?

102
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,571
I heard you're a widow.

103
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,158
That's right. My late husband
left this hotel to me.

104
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,037
I heard that it used to be run
by an elderly couple.

105
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,040
My husband's parents.

106
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,626
Ms. Ienaga,

107
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,419
you have a cute butt,

108
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,088
and your voice is as sweet as birdsong.

109
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,424
I want you to whisper in my ear all night.

110
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,011
You flatter me.

111
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,390
Have you already eaten?

112
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,894
If you like exotic food,
there's a Chinese restaurant nearby.

113
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,064
I find their way of thinking fascinating.

114
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,527
"Like cures like."
Are you familiar with this concept?

115
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,237
"Like cures like"?

116
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,114
If some part of you is unwell,

117
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,951
eat the same part from another animal
to cure your affliction.

118
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,456
Eat the eyes if you have bad eyesight,
the heart if you have heart disease?

119
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,585
I know an old man who said the same thing.

120
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,088
He looked young for his age though.

121
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,840
Apparently, he was a doctor.

122
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,093
I heard he killed his patients

123
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,513
and transfused their blood into himself.

124
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,974
He did the same with their body parts.

125
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,602
Sorry.

126
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,939
This is no topic for a lady.

127
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,525
"Like cures like."

128
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,694
Does it actually work?

129
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,698
All meat is the same
once it's in your stomach.

130
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,078
It works extremely well, sir.

131
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,799
What if… I'm lacking sexual drive?

132
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,219
Which part should I eat, Ms. Ienaga?

133
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,972
You don't seem to be
lacking in that department.

134
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,769
Ms. Ienaga,

135
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
sleep with me.

136
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,944
You're so strong.

137
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,238
You have the arms of a beast.

138
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,032
They're captivating.

139
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,332
Excuse me.

140
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,460
Is anyone here?

141
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,046
It appears there's a new guest.

142
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,591
If you'll excuse me.

143
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,015
I'll be waiting here.

144
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,749
He didn't recognize me.

145
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,001
Is his visit here a coincidence?

146
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,935
Welcome. I'm Ienaga,
the owner of this hotel.

147
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,317
I'm Yoshitake Shiraishi.

148
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,444
I'm single and available.

149
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,447
I'd make a passionate
and devoted boyfriend!

150
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,953
Ms. Ienaga, what's your first name?

151
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,913
It's Kano.

152
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,499
Kano.

153
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,043
What a lovely name.

154
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,795
I'll show you to your rooms.

155
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,644
I can't relax in this room.

156
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,398
We've been sleeping
on pine needles in the wild.

157
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,404
She's got me all fired up.

158
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,991
Shiraishi, you should pick a woman
with more meat on her.

159
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,201
Thick women are better.

160
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,997
Ms. Kano Ienaga.

161
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,833
I think I'm in love.

162
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,087
I gotta turn on the charm
with all I've got.

163
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,381
You should quit while you're ahead.

164
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,800
It never ends well with you.

165
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,678
Kano and I are meant to be together.

166
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,929
I'm sure of it.

167
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,472
I don't see her appeal.

168
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,932
Shut up!

169
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,351
I don't have time to talk to you.

170
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,479
I gotta think of ways to seduce her.

171
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,607
First Ushiyama, now Shiraishi.

172
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,400
A strange coincidence?

173
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm not interested in Shiraishi.

174
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,574
But if he meets Ushiyama,
they may start fighting over the tattoos.

175
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,380
I want Ushiyama's powerful body.

176
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,636
His body will take me
one step closer to perfection.

177
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
Oh.

178
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,368
Hi, Kano.

179
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,162
Sorry, I'm terribly busy right now.

180
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,372
I'll help you.

181
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,428
Huh?

182
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,139
Where did you go?

183
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,518
Kano!

184
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,071
Ms. Ienaga?

185
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
Kano?

186
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,462
Where are you?

187
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,591
Are you in here?

188
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,927
No?

189
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,723
Ms. Ienaga!

190
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,144
What's this?

191
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,021
Oh no. He'll see him.

192
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,689
Ushiyama will see Shiraishi.

193
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,275
Hurry up and come to my room!

194
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,739
Shall we go for lunch?

195
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,700
This is bad. They're too close.

196
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,121
Shiraishi, behind you!

197
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,542
Kano?

198
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,044
That's it. I'm killing him.

199
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,184
Ow!

200
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,852
Ouch!

201
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,896
That really hurt!

202
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,815
What the hell?

203
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,206
Ms. Ienaga, how long
are you going to tease me?

204
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,750
There are other guests.

205
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,127
I need a little more time.

206
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,848
Didn't you hear what I said?

207
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,646
I can't get enough of her.

208
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,488
I should go outside to clear my head.

209
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,419
What's this?

210
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,798
Ew, gross.

211
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,261
What the hell?

212
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,181
Seriously?

213
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,187
You're kidding me.

214
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,820
There's a sick bastard in this hotel.

215
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,615
What's this for?

216
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:46,143
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
KANO IENAGA

217
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,896
A convict?

218
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,234
I manipulated an elderly couple
into giving me the hotel

219
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,907
and then made extensive renovations
using different contractors.

220
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,663
The hotel is a labyrinth,
and I'm the only one who knows the layout.

221
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,881
The perfect setup to steal
what my body lacks from other people.

222
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,053
There's nothing I want from your body,

223
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,598
but I can at least have fun.

224
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,021
I'll separate your flesh and bones
and dissolve them in my chemicals.

225
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,152
Your skin and tattoo too.

226
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,364
But our little fun can wait.

227
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,408
I must get my hands on Ushiyama

228
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,036
and that other new guest.

229
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,957
Those beautiful eyes…

230
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,426
What?

231
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,681
We call those "judo ears."

232
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,975
You must be very experienced.

233
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,895
My ears never turned out that way
for some reason.

234
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,857
So you have judo experience?

235
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,120
One of us will die at this rate.

236
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,706
I like you. My treat.

237
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,333
Let's go drink.

238
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,640
Ezo deer curry rice.

239
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,980
<i>Osoma.</i>

240
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,277
It's fine, Asirpa.
It's the kind of <i>osoma </i>you can eat.

241
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,544
What's wrong?

242
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,838
This <i>osoma </i>is too <i>hinna.</i>

243
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,179
<i>Hinna </i>that's too <i>osoma</i>?

244
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,474
-No, <i>osoma </i>that's too <i>hinna</i>.
-"<i>Osoma </i>that's too <i>hinna</i>"?

245
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,105
Come on, let's have
a Sapporo beer-drinking contest.

246
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,523
Keep it coming!

247
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,607
Cheers!

248
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,616
Did you know?

249
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:35,038
Sapporo's beer factory was built
by a samurai called Hisanari Murahashi.

250
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,459
He was part of the new Imperial government
Toshizo Hijikata fought against

251
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,670
in the Battle of Hakodate.

252
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,591
That old fart Hijikata said,
"I'm still bitter I lost the war,

253
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,511
but I have to admit he makes good beer."

254
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,140
Toshizo Hijikata said that?

255
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:59,020
I'm just saying he'd say that
if he were still alive.

256
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,363
You okay, Asirpa?

257
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,407
What?

258
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,797
That doesn't come off.
It's a callus, not something I stuck on.

259
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,473
Asirpa?

260
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,975
Guys, come help me!

261
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,604
Asirpa, stop that right now.

262
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,439
That's enough.

263
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,945
Little lady, I hope you grow up
to be a fine woman.

264
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,949
Do you know what makes a good man?

265
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,243
His penis.

266
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,955
I'm not talking about the size.

267
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,166
You need to check

268
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,336
whether the man has a gentleman's penis.

269
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,386
Thanks for the food, Professor Penis.

270
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:14,930
You're welcome.

271
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,487
Ms. Ienaga, I'm back!

272
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,140
There we go.

273
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,560
Damn.

274
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,021
Damn it.

275
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,900
Yes. Almost there!

276
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,489
Ushiyama? What are you doing here?

277
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,200
Never mind. Just help me.

278
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,244
That Ienaga is one crazy bastard.

279
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:21,913
Ienaga?

280
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,625
Yeah. He's a tattooed convict.

281
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,460
Hurry up and free me!

282
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,713
-Ushiyama?
-Ms. Ienaga!

283
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,048
-Wait!
-Ms. Ienaga!

284
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,509
Wait! Stop!

285
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,386
Ow! That hurts!

286
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,846
Ouch! Stop that!

287
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,598
You're gonna tear my nipple off!

288
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,433
Help! Someone, anyone!

289
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,767
You stink.

290
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,219
Got it.

291
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,222
Finally.

292
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,438
Hey, Ushiyama.

293
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,607
I remember now. That Ienaga is--

294
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,359
Ms. Ienaga!

295
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,653
Ushiyama? Hey, listen--

296
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,738
-Ms. Ienaga!
-Whoa!

297
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,743
Ms. Ienaga!

298
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,954
Stop that.

299
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,791
That's not gonna work.

300
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,669
Let's escape through the ceiling trapdoor.

301
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,712
Ms. Ienaga!

302
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,720
There we go.

303
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,479
He's not listening.

304
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,815
His lust has taken over him.

305
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,201
Ms. Ienaga!

306
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,083
Ms. Ienaga!

307
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,297
Beautiful.

308
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,428
Such delicate skin and radiant hair.

309
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,306
And these eyes…

310
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,146
Deep blue with faint traces of green.

311
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,023
I want them.

312
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,255
Why the hell did you lick her eyeball?

313
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,967
I screwed up.
The knockout gas was too weak.

314
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,972
I would never do such a thing!

315
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,807
You must be mistaken!

316
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,727
She seemed unwell
when she returned to the hotel.

317
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,897
I came to check on her, that's all.

318
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,820
Sugimoto! Let me in!

319
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,198
This hotel is dangerous!

320
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,159
There's an underground torture chamber
filled with bodies.

321
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,661
Ienaga is a tattooed convict!

322
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:53,541
He's actually an old man,
a former doctor who ate his patients!

323
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,794
You're an old man?

324
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,594
Humans are greedy creatures.

325
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,305
We yearn for the things we lack.

326
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,058
But look.

327
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,685
I was right.

328
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,523
Youth, strength, beauty.

329
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,443
I was able to get them all
by eating other people.

330
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,030
So you were trying to eat
Asirpa's beautiful eyes.

331
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,074
Like cures like.

332
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,078
I take whatever I lack from other people.
Simple as that.

333
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,415
It doesn't work like that.
You're just deluding yourself.

334
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,377
But you're right.

335
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,462
Humans are greedy.

336
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm gonna skin you
and take your tattoo with me.

337
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,325
Shiraishi! Ienaga escaped!

338
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,161
What? I didn't see anyone come out!

339
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,249
Those idiots ruined everything.

340
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,341
Ms. Ienaga.

341
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,302
You walking penis!

342
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,262
Ms. Ienaga!

343
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,556
Wake up!

344
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,726
Wake up, Kiroranke!

345
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:40,064
We gotta get out of this murder hotel!
Hey! Wake up!

346
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,113
Ms. Ienaga!

347
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,034
Ms. Ienaga?

348
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,996
Stay away, you crazy doctor!

349
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,416
Shiraishi!

350
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,850
Ms. Ienaga.

351
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,483
This guest is also a tattooed convict!

352
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,033
This is Mr. Ushiyama the Undefeated!

353
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,328
Ms. Ienaga!

354
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,639
The hotel's done for.
I must destroy all evidence.

355
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,856
Damn it.

356
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,025
Just when it was getting good.

357
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,363
Wanna give it a go?

358
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,465
Damn baldy!

359
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,163
Alcohol.

360
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,882
Sugimoto!

361
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,301
I got Ienaga! Sugimoto!

362
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,512
Shiraishi?

363
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,347
You're staying here too?

364
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,349
Finally back to your senses?

365
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:30,062
If you're here, the guy I fought
must be Immortal Sugimoto.

366
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,110
-Kiroranke.
-Asirpa's unconscious.

367
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,696
The cellar's on fire. We gotta go.

368
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,448
Got her.

369
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,741
This is bad.

370
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,950
We gotta get out.

371
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,327
-Wait.
-Huh?

372
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,039
Hand over the tattoo copy.
I came to get it from you.

373
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,083
A message from the old man.

374
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,464
"Keep me informed of your whereabouts.
Don't think you can outwit me."

375
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,467
Now give me the copy.

376
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,261
This isn't the time for that!

377
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,639
Meet me tomorrow at the gun shop.

378
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,857
Let's blow this joint!

379
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,150
Time to go!

380
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,486
Gotta run.

381
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,571
Huh?

382
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,074
The explosives…

383
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,743
I lost them.

384
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,370
What?

385
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,247
They're gonna blow! Run!

386
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,847
-What was that?
-Just go!

387
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,015
We'll get trapped!

388
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,446
Ushiyama…

389
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,201
Here to skin me?

390
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,593
You'll die, too, if you don't get out now.

391
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,359
You're like me.
You never stopped honing your body.

392
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,071
When I was young…

393
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,452
I was strong and beautiful.

394
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,164
I was perfect then.

395
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,918
I wanted to be perfect again.

396
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,675
When were you…

397
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,679
at your most perfect?

398
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,760
Where's Professor Penis?

399
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,682
Professor Penis!

400
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,038
Do you know what makes a good man?

401
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,040
His penis.

402
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,585
Professor Penis.

403
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,425
That's a piece of fish cake.

404
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,555
What now?

405
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,642
There are two tattooed convicts,
Ienaga and Ushiyama, buried in there.

406
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,686
This way!

407
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,104
Look.

408
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,776
We don't want to run into
the police or the army.

409
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,570
-Let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

410
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,552
AKEBOSHI GUN SHOP

411
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,104
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

412
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,108
Here, the copy of Kazuo Henmi's tattoo.

413
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,195
How did a klutz like you

414
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,781
copy the tattoo without Sugimoto noticing?

415
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,745
They don't call me
the Escape King for nothing.

416
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,373
It better not be a fake.

417
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,708
It's the real deal.

418
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,961
I'm spying for you guys, aren't I?

419
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,838
Whatever. Follow me.

420
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,475
Ienaga survived too?

421
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,145
Is it a good idea to let a doctor see him?

422
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,064
We're just borrowing the place.

423
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,192
No one saw Ienaga's tattoo.

424
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,198
Is this monster even worth saving?

425
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,955
Wait…

426
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,998
What's this?

427
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,208
Are you in love?

428
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,251
Of course not!

429
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,128
A good doctor is always useful.

430
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,840
And I got to hear something interesting.

431
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,553
Ienaga, tell him what you told me.

432
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,811
About a month ago,

433
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,232
a young man and a middle-aged man
came to the hotel.

434
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,946
I locked the young, beautiful man
in the cellar.

435
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,824
Right before I took his blood…

436
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,910
What is this place?

437
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,329
Let me go!

438
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,748
What did I do to deserve this?

439
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,085
What are you gonna do with that long nose?

440
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,962
My grandpa told me,

441
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,214
"Stay away from the <i>tengu</i>."

442
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,634
<i>He was a whimpering mess.</i>

443
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,470
But he said something unexpected.

444
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,265
<i>"The man who came with me</i>

445
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,351
<i>has the same tattoo as you."</i>

446
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,815
<i>"He's a convict</i>
<i>who escaped from Abashiri."</i>

447
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:44,121
<i>After killing the young man,</i>
<i>I went to their room.</i>

448
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,707
<i>The older man had run off.</i>

449
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,295
The younger man's disappearance
must have spooked him.

450
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,590
You've never seen the older man before?

451
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,008
No.

452
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,345
Do you know where he went?

453
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,474
According to the young man,

454
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,313
his companion was headed to Hidaka
to meet an American named Dunn.

455
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,985
Why are you letting me hear this?

456
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,362
It's a job for you.

457
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,657
I'll take Ienaga to Hijikata.

458
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,912
In the meantime,
you guys will go get the tattoo in Hidaka.

459
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,166
You won't say no, right?

460
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,064
I asked the onlookers.

461
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,943
The firefighters and the police
didn't find anyone in the rubble.

462
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,701
He's alive. I know it.

463
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,703
His penis.

464
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,037
Professor Penis…

465
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,915
Get rid of that fish cake.

466
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,171
Damn that Shiraishi.

467
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,424
He used my grenades without asking.

468
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,342
Where did he go?

469
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,553
To Susukino, I bet.

470
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,221
That horny baldy.

471
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,932
Well, a cute girl in Susukino

472
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,727
gave me a lead on another convict.

473
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,395
Another convict?

474
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,312
Yeah.

475
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,940
A middle-aged man who visited Susukino

476
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,985
had one of the tattoos.

477
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,530
He said he was heading to Hidaka.

478
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,282
Hidaka?

479
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,453
<i>We're going to Abashiri from the south</i>

480
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,664
<i>'cause the Seventh Division HQ</i>
<i>is in Asahikawa.</i>

481
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,750
<i>Hidaka's along the way.</i>

482
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,545
Who knows if we'll get to meet Noppera-Bo
in Abashiri?

483
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:02,676
If we get a chance to find other convicts
along the way, we should go for it.

484
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,473
Okay. Let's go to Hidaka.

485
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,519
I'll go wherever you go, Asirpa.

486
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,314
One problem.

487
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,610
The money I brought went up in smoke.

488
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,071
Asirpa, lend me some money.

489
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,283
Gambling is the fastest way to earn money.

490
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,493
You idiot.

491
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,078
You wasted Kiroranke's grenades.

492
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,247
We had to use Asirpa's money to buy more.

493
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,126
You're so annoying.

494
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,294
Forget it.

495
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,672
We'll hunt to cover our travel expenses.

496
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,551
My great-uncle's <i>kotan</i>
is in Yufutsu, Tomakomai.

497
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,770
SAPPORO

498
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,816
YUFUTSU

499
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:04,196
This is my great-uncle,
the youngest of Huci's six brothers.

500
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,282
We can stay in this <i>cise </i>tonight.

501
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:15,374
We've been getting
some surprising visitors lately.

502
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,842
"Recently, a strange woman
came to stay in our village."

503
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,598
"She says she can see
the past and future."

504
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,479
"The village is going mad because of her."

505
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,537
"Here she comes."

506
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,581
"Her name is Inkarmat."

507
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,825
My, what handsome <i>nispa</i>.

508
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,665
Yoshitake Shiraishi, single and available.

509
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,920
I have a weak spot for men with scars.

510
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,465
Like that handsome soldier over there.

511
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,302
Thanks.

512
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,890
Sugimoto puts poop in his soup
and eats it.

513
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,517
Really? Doesn't it smell terrible?

514
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,647
Asirpa, did you just say "Sugimoto,"
"<i>ohaw</i>," and "<i>osoma</i>" in the same sentence?

515
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,606
Nope.

516
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,248
You came here from Otaru, didn't you?

517
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,875
How did you know?

518
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:28,423
She must've heard that my great-uncle
has many relatives in Otaru.

519
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,929
You're looking for someone

520
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,683
or perhaps something.

521
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,519
No way! Yes, that's exactly right!

522
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,605
I'm good at fortune-telling.

523
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,649
It's called <i>niwok</i>.

524
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:49,152
We use it to divine what we should do
when we can't decide.

525
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,153
Really?

526
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,449
The result of the <i>niwok</i>
is the will of the gods.

527
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,326
We follow it without question.

528
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,169
<i>Siratki kamuy</i>.

529
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,715
A fox skull used for fortune-telling.

530
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,677
This white fox skull
has been in my family for generations.

531
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,139
White foxes have
the most spiritual energy.

532
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:24,187
You place the lower jaw
on your head and drop it.

533
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,399
The direction of the teeth
shows your future.

534
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,653
If the teeth point upwards,
it's a good sign.

535
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,826
Let us see if you'll find
what you're looking for.

536
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,124
Swift god, mighty god.

537
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,253
I may be a woman of little worth,

538
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,505
but please guide me thoroughly.

539
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,638
The teeth point downwards.

540
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,099
It's an ominous sign.

541
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,519
You should cancel your plans.

542
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,813
No way…

543
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,982
She's just guessing.

544
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,987
I don't believe in predictions.

545
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,449
I'm a modern Ainu woman.

546
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,289
Is that so?

547
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,088
By the way…

548
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,009
you're looking for your father,
aren't you?

549
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,391
Don't mind me.
Like you said, I'm just guessing.

550
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,481
Wow.

551
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,317
She got it right.

552
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,028
I don't trust her.

553
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,073
That <i>ikatkar cironnup</i>.

554
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,659
What's that?

555
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,702
<i>Cironnup </i>means "fox."

556
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,248
We call black foxes <i>situnpe kamuy</i>.

557
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:10,502
It means "the mountain fox god."
They help cure diseases.

558
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,507
But we call red foxes <i>ikatkar cironnup</i>.

559
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,261
It means "trickster fox."

560
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,240
A bear!

561
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,825
Go! I'll hold them off.

562
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,326
It's just as dangerous in here.

563
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,412
You guys led the bears here.

564
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,498
Your eyes are the same beautiful color
as your father's.

565
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,624
Princess!

566
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,460
So one of them is a tattooed convict?

567
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,379
It's a one-roll bet. Place your bets!

568
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,797
It's your fault!

569
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,425
Hey, he's a convict!

570
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,380
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

571
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,965
