1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,306
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,894
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,397
203 METER HILL

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,065
I'm

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,651
Immortal Sugimoto!

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:32,198
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,367
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,412
<i>With the help of Asirpa,</i>
<i>a young Ainu girl,</i>

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>and Shiraishi, an escaped convict,</i>
<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,543
We will find the gold.

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,672
I know about what happened
in Abashiri Prison.

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,215
Noppera-Bo

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,301
is Asirpa's father.

15
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,678
I'm going to meet Noppera-Bo.

16
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,140
I want to see with my own eyes
whether Noppera-Bo is Aca.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>Hijikata's group, led by</i>
<i>Toshizo Hijikata, one of the escapees.</i>

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Lieutenant Tsurumi.</i>

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>The two factions join the hunt,</i>
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

20
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,282
<i>After acquiring Wakayama's tattoo…</i>

21
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,784
Princess!

22
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>…Sugimoto's group</i>
<i>now has a total of six tattoos.</i>

23
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>Hijikata's group has six.</i>

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,378
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Tsurumi, has one.</i>

25
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,422
<i>Thirteen tattoos left.</i>

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,261
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of their grueling journey</i>

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,389
<i>to be the first to collect all 24 tattoos</i>

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,143
<i>and find the hidden trove of Ainu gold.</i>

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,737
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

30
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,701
Too hot.

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,514
Right now,
we have my tattooed code, Ienaga's,

32
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,266
Toshizo Hijikata's,

33
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:27,272
and oil-paper copies
of Shiraishi's and Henmi's tattoos.

34
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,482
We also have

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,281
the skin Hyakunosuke Ogata
took from the Hidoro yakuza family.

36
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,074
That's six tattoos.

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,160
Now we're waiting to see

38
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:46,332
whether Shiraishi's group got the tattoo
from the convict who went to Hidaka.

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,835
They have Immortal Sugimoto.

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,920
He'll get it done.

41
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,674
Excuse me.

42
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,720
How many are there altogether?

43
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,601
There are 24 in all.

44
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,731
So you gather freaks, old men, and thugs…

45
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,277
to help you recreate the Republic of Ezo?

46
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,908
How exactly do you intend
to take on the government and win?

47
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,205
Noppera-Bo is

48
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,082
an Ainu, right?

49
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:35,173
Lieutenant Tsurumi figured it out
from the information he gathered.

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,806
The belongings of the seven Ainu killed by
Noppera-Bo had something in common.

51
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>Their knives and tobacco cases</i>
<i>all had new scratches on them.</i>

52
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:59,030
Apparently, it's an Ainu custom to put
new scratches on the dead's belongings.

53
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,077
They believe this allows the deceased
to use the items in the afterlife.

54
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,707
The killer brutally cut up the bodies…

55
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,792
ABASHIRI PRISON

56
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,962
<i>…yet carefully put scratches</i>
<i>on his victims' belongings.</i>

57
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,048
<i>Was he trying to repent?</i>

58
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,888
<i>The seven victims were representatives</i>
<i>from different villages.</i>

59
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,767
<i>They wanted the gold to buy weapons</i>
<i>to fight the Japanese.</i>

60
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>If Noppera-Bo wants</i>
<i>an independent Hokkaido for the Ainu…</i>

61
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,194
<i>why did he turn on the others?</i>

62
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,613
<i>Why did he kill them?</i>

63
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,496
Noppera-Bo is probably
a partisan of the Russian Far East

64
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,748
disguised as an Ainu.

65
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,168
What's that?

66
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,298
To put it simply,

67
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:05,388
partisans are militia
who fight in civil wars and revolutions.

68
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,809
In the Russian Far East,

69
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:15,023
there are many guerrilla squads

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,901
made up of ethnic minorities
around the Amur River.

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,239
Russia is

72
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,451
a fractured nation.

73
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,246
Tsarist Russia, dominated by Russians.

74
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,250
The Jewish Communist Party, led by Lenin.

75
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:40,923
And ethnic minority partisans
living in the Far East.

76
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,384
In Russia,

77
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,264
these groups are killing each other
in a three-way war.

78
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,438
In other words,

79
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,068
Noppera-Bo wanted to help
the Russian Far East achieve independence.

80
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:05,239
He tried to take the Ainu gold there
via Karafuto but failed.

81
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,242
And that's why we're here now.

82
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:15,792
That means Noppera-Bo's allies
waiting outside of the prison…

83
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,588
It's highly likely

84
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,425
<i>they're partisans posing as Ainu.</i>

85
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,018
I got this bow from a renowned hunter.

86
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,105
You can have it.

87
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,402
In return, I'd like to ask you something.

88
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:48,408
Why did you skin that man
and take his strange tattoo with you?

89
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,288
You're better off not knowing.
You'll die if you get involved.

90
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,793
Let me show you something.

91
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,343
A book? What's so special about it?

92
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,264
It was made by a man who lives in Yubari.

93
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,517
It came into my possession by chance.

94
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:22,483
The man who stole it said he saw
a strange tattooed skin in the house,

95
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,112
different from that of a yakuza.

96
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,323
Ew. Is that…

97
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,201
Human skin?

98
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,874
Yubari, huh.

99
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,420
<i>Yubari.</i>

100
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,466
<i>Once a vast area</i>
<i>of dense, unexplored forest,</i>

101
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:51,512
<i>a large vein of coal was discovered there</i>
<i>in the 21st year of the Meiji era.</i>

102
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:56,309
<i>By the late Meiji era, Yubari's population</i>
<i>had grown to over 20,000.</i>

103
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,782
Sergeant Tsukishima,
keep your eyes on that grave.

104
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,995
The man buried there died yesterday
in a mine explosion.

105
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,538
Yes, sir.

106
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,291
Someone's been robbing graves here.

107
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,545
The robber only takes
the bodies of the newly dead.

108
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,925
What is it, Nikaido?

109
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:35,264
Yohei's ear… looks just like yours,
Lieutenant Tsurumi.

110
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,685
Lieutenant Tsurumi,
may I have your left ear?

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,438
I'd like Yohei to have two ears.

112
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,315
Fine.

113
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,567
You can have it if I die.

114
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,538
Do you mean it, Lieutenant Tsurumi?

115
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,962
Don't kill him.

116
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,156
EPISODE 6: AN EXEMPLARY ARTISAN

117
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,619
EDOGAI TAXIDERMY WORKSHOP

118
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,084
Oh, it looks like we have a visitor.

119
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,713
No need to get up. I'll go see who it is.

120
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,507
What do they want so early in the morning?

121
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,223
Yes? How can I help you?

122
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,684
Good morning.

123
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,563
I heard there's a taxidermist here.

124
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,440
Are you Yasaku Edogai?

125
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,483
Yes, that's me.

126
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,112
Come in.

127
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,513
Impressive.

128
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:44,477
Your creations are as wonderful
and eye-catching as the rumors say.

129
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,939
There's even a polar bear.

130
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,778
I imported the hide
and mounted it on a manikin I made.

131
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:59,033
Is there enough demand here in Yubari
to sustain your taxidermy business?

132
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,245
No, most of the orders are from overseas.

133
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:08,000
The rich people abroad want mounts
of animals found only in Japan.

134
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,465
I was born in Nara, but it's too hot
and humid there for taxidermy.

135
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,968
I wanted to make better mounts,

136
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,681
so I moved to Hokkaido
because it's cold and dry.

137
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,266
You came to Yubari alone?

138
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,019
No, with my mother.

139
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,688
I see.

140
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,524
I admire your dedication.

141
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,026
You're an exemplary artisan.

142
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,237
You flatter me. Thank…

143
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:44,662
Edogai, I came to return
the glove you dropped.

144
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,081
What are you talking about?

145
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,669
What's that sound?

146
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,255
Something's wrong.

147
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,757
Maybe we should go take a look.

148
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,759
You're being dramatic.

149
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,513
Yasaku, is everything all right?

150
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,599
I'm fine. I knocked over a mount.

151
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,356
I've never seen that glove.

152
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,024
It's not mine.

153
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,903
You thought you shook us off last night?

154
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,283
We pretended to lose you
and followed you here.

155
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,911
Edogai.

156
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,291
I wonder if that taxidermist has it.

157
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,379
A coal miner with a strange tattoo
died in a mining accident.

158
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,923
He was buried in that graveyard.

159
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,887
Maeyama and I dug up his grave,
but it was empty.

160
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,513
In other words,

161
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,353
the grave robber must've taken…
the corpse of the tattooed convict.

162
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,940
Cave-ins, dust explosions…

163
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,152
People die in coal mines all the time.

164
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,572
And since most miners are drifters,

165
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,827
Yubari provides a convenient supply
of fresh human corpses.

166
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

167
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,876
Please leave.

168
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,963
You've been diligently
digging up bodies night after night.

169
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,551
You peeled off their skin
and made this glove.

170
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,596
Splendid!

171
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,518
Can you make me a pair?

172
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,353
What?

173
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,523
You're not here to arrest me?

174
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,026
Catching grave robbers is not my job.

175
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,824
Oh, I'm sorry.

176
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,578
That glove isn't made of human skin.

177
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,333
It's made of pigskin,
which looks and feels like human skin.

178
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,668
Pigskin?

179
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,755
I made it as a joke.
I'll admit it's in poor taste.

180
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,092
<i>To tell the truth, I went to the graveyard</i>

181
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,262
<i>to secretly dispose of</i>
<i>animal organs and bones.</i>

182
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,475
I thought you found out about it
and came to arrest me.

183
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,313
We should kill him and search his house.

184
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,318
Lieutenant Tsurumi could've killed him
on the porch, but he didn't.

185
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,530
He must have other plans.

186
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:26,907
By the way,

187
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,869
where's Nikaido?

188
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,748
I like this glove.

189
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,751
Can you make me a pair?

190
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,797
It's soft and supple to the touch.

191
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,800
The stitching is absolutely flawless.

192
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,054
I've never seen
such a beautiful leather glove.

193
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,517
If you like it that much,
I'll give it to you.

194
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,978
I have another one just like it.
Let me get it.

195
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>It's been a while</i>
<i>since you sounded so happy.</i>

196
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,371
He's the first person
who truly understands my work.

197
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,624
I'm so happy.

198
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,213
Hello, everyone.

199
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,935
Did you make these
out of pigskin too, Edogai?

200
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,564
<i>He saw us. Kill him!</i>

201
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,857
<i>Kill him.</i>

202
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,151
<i>Peel his skin off and stuff him.</i>

203
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,903
<i>Don't trust him, Yasaku.</i>

204
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,280
<i>He's a bad man.</i>

205
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,241
But Mom, he's…

206
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,871
It appears you're the only one
who can hear your mother's voice.

207
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,040
<i>Kill him!</i>

208
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>I told you to stay away from other people.</i>

209
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,046
<i>Now that he's seen us, he has to die.</i>

210
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,883
Why must you always
take everything from me?

211
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,344
You even killed Dad, who was on my side!

212
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,974
I must say,
talking to stuffed people isn't healthy.

213
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>Shut up, freaky forehead.</i>

214
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,480
<i>Your father was a bad man,</i>
<i>just like all other men.</i>

215
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,525
<i>I'm the only one who loves you.</i>

216
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,112
Stop it, please!

217
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,157
Edogai.

218
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,537
Edogai!

219
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
You're a genius.

220
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,808
This is human skin, right?

221
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,184
Does it suit me?

222
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,354
I peeled it off of a corpse to make it.

223
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,982
You made it yourself? That's amazing.

224
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,276
It suits you.

225
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,318
Right?

226
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,779
<i>You mustn't let him deceive you.</i>

227
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,198
Mom, be quiet!

228
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,325
Let's talk in the workshop.

229
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:37,139
I see that you tanned the skin,
but the fleshing could use more work.

230
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,140
"Fleshing"?

231
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,687
The process of scraping off
meat and fat from the skin.

232
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,898
You have to be very thorough.

233
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,360
Otherwise, the skin may rot
during the summer when it's hot.

234
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,907
Your skin looks a little irritated.

235
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,035
Did you use alum as a tanning agent?

236
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,203
Yes.

237
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,956
Alum tanning is an easy tanning method
often used by hunters,

238
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,501
but it isn't suitable for sensitive skin.

239
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,881
I would recommend using tannins instead.

240
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,467
I use tannin from early stachyurus.

241
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:18,263
Since it's plant-based,
it won't irritate your skin.

242
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:25,479
The leather will be stiff at first
but will soften and fit your body in time.

243
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,358
Just be careful when the skin is wet.

244
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,694
It'll change color
under certain circumstances.

245
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,114
Edogai.

246
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,326
If you have other works, can I see them?

247
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,381
Don't be shy now.

248
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,009
Come out, Edogai!

249
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,354
What do you think, Mr. Tsurumi?

250
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,691
It's fantastic, Edogai.

251
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,153
Strut your stuff.

252
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,878
Very nice.

253
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,337
Go on, do a twirl.

254
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,884
Nice!

255
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,887
I love that cute little tail!

256
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,182
Very nice.

257
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,766
The tail even moves!

258
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,328
Fabulous!

259
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,464
Wow.

260
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,550
I like it.

261
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,138
You're on the cutting edge
of fashion, Edogai!

262
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,393
Want to see the rest?

263
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,811
Of course.

264
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,067
This is so fun!

265
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,239
What are we looking at?

266
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,163
No.

267
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,123
It's not the same.

268
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,918
Lieutenant Tsurumi's ear
is still the best.

269
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,880
Yohei's ear…

270
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,477
Huh?

271
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,991
Mom?

272
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,994
<i>Help!</i>

273
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,290
I found the ear!

274
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,375
What are you doing to my mother?!

275
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,671
-Hello?
-Mr. Tsurumi?

276
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,588
Yes, speaking.

277
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,382
Hello?

278
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,180
Hold it firmly.

279
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,063
How dare you point a gun
at your own mother!

280
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,275
Shoot your mother.

281
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,908
Don't!

282
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,619
Time to leave the nest.

283
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:15,334
You grew up twisted
because the nest is twisted.

284
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,294
Don't shoot!

285
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,506
You need to decide for yourself, Edogai.

286
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,816
The voice stopped.

287
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,946
Thank you.

288
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,784
You left the nest.

289
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,244
Congratulations.

290
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,915
Let's dance.

291
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,087
Put this on.

292
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,636
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
SOROKU FUNABASHI

293
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,730
<i>The leather glove you dropped…</i>

294
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,984
<i>was the inspiration I needed.</i>

295
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,241
<i>I knew I needed the help</i>
<i>of a genius artisan like yourself.</i>

296
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,206
<i>What can I do to help you?</i>

297
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,837
<i>The tattooed human skins we're wearing now</i>

298
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,048
<i>are part of a code.</i>

299
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,137
I want to make fake tattooed human skins.

300
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,639
Fakes?

301
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:02,482
<i>We will make exquisite counterfeit skins</i>
<i>that only we can identify.</i>

302
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,069
<i>It's a job only you can do.</i>

303
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,531
<i>Your masterful work</i>

304
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,868
<i>is exactly what we need</i>

305
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,912
<i>to throw the tattoo hunt into chaos!</i>

306
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,721
Huh?

307
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,684
The gallbladder of a bear from Hidaka?

308
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,571
The price should be about…

309
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,991
I'll pay you this much.

310
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,455
Listen, little lady.

311
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,833
I usually only buy
from hunters I know and trust.

312
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,294
Be grateful that I'm willing to buy it.

313
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,505
Got a problem?

314
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,050
Listen, Medicine Man.

315
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,552
You think we're stupid?

316
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,224
You messin' with us?

317
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,351
Not at all.

318
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,815
Dear me, I do apologize.

319
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:31,947
They're veterans of the war, you see.

320
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,702
They don't know how to go easy on people.

321
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,787
In fact,

322
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,665
they're ruthless animals.

323
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,874
Shut up!

324
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,586
Hey, watch it!

325
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,172
Hurry up and recalculate it.

326
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,132
Yes, sir.

327
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,102
Would this be acceptable?

328
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,402
Glad we were able to sell the gallbladder.

329
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,156
Thanks to that,
we can eat white rice today.

330
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,415
Dinner's ready!

331
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,709
Lamprey, grilled <i>kabayaki-style</i>.

332
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,628
That's an interesting way to cook <i>ukuripe</i>.

333
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,838
<i>Ukuripe</i>?

334
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,549
<i>Ukuripe </i>is the Ainu word
for Arctic lampreys.

335
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,095
It's a fusion of Ainu
and Japanese cuisine.

336
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:42,225
<i>Ukuripe</i>… à la grilled eel on rice.

337
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,695
-Let's dig in.
-Yeah.

338
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,163
The cartilage is crunchy.

339
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,581
It's <i>hinna</i>.

340
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:10,837
Lampreys look like eels,
but their skeleton is entirely cartilage.

341
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,924
That reminds me of an Ainu legend.

342
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:21,264
A god caught a bear, cut it to pieces,
and ferried them down the Ishikari River.

343
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:26,353
The boat capsized, and the bear intestines
turned to <i>ukuripe </i>in the river water.

344
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,398
And that's why lampreys don't have bones.

345
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,445
Maybe Shiraishi's joints are all squishy

346
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,490
because he's made of that bear's penis.

347
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,575
Oh my gosh, Asirpa.

348
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,293
We'll be looking for the tattoo tomorrow.

349
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,966
Question is, how do we find the person
who made that book?

350
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,637
He's a weirdo who plays with human skin.

351
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,264
We just have to follow the rumors.

352
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,065
Is that you, Mr. Maeyama?

353
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,902
Please stop touching my stuff.

354
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,409
I'm going to the bathhouse. Stay vigilant.

355
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,326
Yes, sir.

356
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,595
<i>Yubari, Yubari, town full of slopes</i>

357
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:47,475
<i>Death comes for us when the mine explodes</i>

358
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,479
<i>Yubari, Yubari, town full of slopes</i>

359
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,482
The chimney smoke is split in two.

360
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,529
-Someone's gonna die in the mine.
-Don't say that!

361
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,619
Shoot. I forgot my wallet.

362
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,542
That soldier was with Lieutenant Tsurumi.

363
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,879
I guess they heard the rumors too.

364
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,172
Let's follow him.

365
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,175
Should I get Kiroranke and Asirpa?
They're over there.

366
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,885
No time for that. Let's go.

367
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,859
Wait, that's Sergeant Tsukishima's.

368
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,825
What should I do?

369
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,828
I did it!

370
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,081
These fake skins are perfect.

371
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,667
Six for now.

372
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,129
Mr. Tsurumi will be so happy.

373
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,674
He'll pat my head and say I'm a good boy.

374
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,014
Is that you, Mr. Tsukishima?

375
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,601
Please contact Lieutenant Tsurumi
in Otaru.

376
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,271
The perfect fakes are ready…

377
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,111
Mr. Maeyama?

378
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,961
Who's that? He's coming this way.

379
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,463
Is he after the tattooed skins?

380
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,822
Mr. Tsurumi.

381
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,577
I have to escape!

382
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,664
But the front door is my only way out.

383
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,249
What do I do?

384
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,012
While Tsukishima takes his long bath,

385
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,849
I'll make the taxidermist
tell me what the plan is.

386
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,797
Someone has good taste.

387
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,987
I see.

388
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,281
They were making fake skins.

389
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,160
This is bad.

390
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,163
Lieutenant Tsurumi has the upper hand.

391
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,504
He got away.

392
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,347
Six fake tattooed skins. Two real ones.

393
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,224
I must keep them safe

394
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,268
and deliver them to Mr. Tsurumi!

395
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,520
Mr. Tsurumi!

396
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,375
How dare you kill Maeyama.

397
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,463
How dare you kill your comrade, Ogata!

398
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,673
He's not my comrade.

399
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,842
You guys are rebels.

400
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,430
And you're HQ's mouser.
I know what you're up to.

401
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,685
You think catching rebels for your master
will help you rise through the ranks.

402
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:27,440
Your father was the division leader.
You'll do anything to surpass him.

403
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,028
Edogai, are you alive?

404
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,831
I have to catch the taxidermist
before Tsukishima.

405
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,377
Shouldn't we go after the guy who fled?

406
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,506
I want to check this house first.

407
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,596
It's just one pest after another.

408
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,314
The Seventh Division.

409
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,067
One of Lieutenant Tsurumi's men.

410
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,944
What's going on?

411
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,780
Did they have a falling out?

412
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,743
Something's fishy.

413
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,457
Maybe that book
was stolen from this house.

414
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,793
Huh?

415
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,961
What the hell?

416
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,469
You're Yoshitake Shiraishi, right?

417
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,514
I heard about you from Hijikata.

418
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,899
Take Sugimoto with you…
and go after the guy who just left.

419
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,109
Careful, Shiraishi.

420
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,403
We may not be alone in here.

421
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,281
Sugimoto!

422
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,950
Look what I found.

423
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,785
Here.

424
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,374
Lieutenant Tsurumi was probably
making fake tattooed skins here.

425
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,627
The guy who just left must've stolen them.

426
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,962
We better go after him.

427
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,798
Hurry!

428
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,602
Mr. Tsurumi.

429
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,862
Mr. Tsurumi…

430
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,740
Mr. Tsurumi…

431
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,533
Mr. Tsurumi.

432
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,704
Mr. Tsurumi…

433
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,415
Mr. Tsurumi!

434
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,129
Seen a polar bear?

435
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,474
Wait.

436
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,935
Did a soldier run past here?

437
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,937
That way.

438
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,188
Thanks.

439
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,860
Mr. Tsurumi…

440
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,658
Your luck ran out the moment
you got involved with Lieutenant Tsurumi.

441
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,410
Get in, Edogai!

442
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,374
Trolley thieves!

443
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,001
-There he is!
-Hey!

444
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,753
-Get on a trolley!
-Okay.

445
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,055
Mr. Tsukishima,
let's escape through the mine.

446
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,308
We'll make use of
the intersecting tunnels and exits.

447
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:54,522
The two skins on top are real,
and the rest are the fakes I made.

448
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,732
I'll deliver these to Mr. Tsurumi

449
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,152
and ask him to pet my head
and lick my face!

450
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,446
Mr. Tsurumi!

451
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,452
Immortal Sugimoto?

452
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,498
He must've heard
the rumors about the tattooed skin.

453
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,093
We can't let them escape.

454
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,179
If they start planting fake skins,
we're screwed.

455
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,027
You can do better than that.
We don't want them to escape now, do we?

456
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,904
There's a gas leak!

457
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,031
Run!

458
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,411
Another gas explosion.

459
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,372
That was a big one.

460
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,166
The mountain shook.

461
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,128
It's a catastrophe.

462
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,527
Shiraishi, wake up.

463
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,530
Wake up!

464
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,909
You're useless!

465
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,460
Gas?

466
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,339
I'm

467
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,260
Immortal Sugimoto!

468
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,031
Edogai?

469
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,785
Where are you, Edogai? Are you alive?

470
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,788
Mr. Tsukishima, I'm over here.

471
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,047
I'll get you out.

472
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,009
Mr. Tsukishima, leave me and go.

473
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,680
The rocks crushed my legs.

474
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,980
Give this to Mr. Tsurumi,

475
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,234
the first person
who's ever appreciated me.

476
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:52,324
I have… one last message for him.

477
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,959
<i>Coal mine fires are extinguished</i>
<i>by sealing the tunnels.</i>

478
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,422
<i>The tunnel exits are sealed</i>
<i>to cut off the airflow,</i>

479
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,592
<i>even if there are people inside</i>
<i>trying to get out.</i>

480
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,554
There are still people in there.

481
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,306
We have to put out the fire!

482
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,732
Hey, there's a vent over here. Follow me.

483
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,389
Shiraishi.

484
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,350
Shiraishi!

485
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,519
Breathe.

486
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,771
Don't die on me now.

487
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,097
Fish cake?

488
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,895
Don't tell me you're dying already,
Immortal Sugimoto.

489
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,819
I knew you wouldn't die so easily.

490
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,532
Give me a hand.

491
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,868
-You okay?
-Look. Someone's coming out.

492
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,288
Wow, he saved two people.

493
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,349
Hello, little lady. We meet again.

494
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,600
Hey, you okay?

495
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,102
Professor Penis.

496
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,188
You still have the fish cake?

497
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,029
Why are you here?

498
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,283
I came to Yubari with someone,
but he wandered off.

499
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,287
I was looking for him when I saw
you guys getting in a mine cart.

500
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,498
Who's "him"?

501
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,126
I guess we have no choice.

502
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,378
Bring them with us.

503
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,131
I remember you.

504
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,633
You're one of Lieutenant Tsurumi's men.

505
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,302
Why are you with Ushiyama?

506
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,940
There are six corpses here.

507
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:40,863
They probably used these six bodies
to make fake tattooed skins.

508
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,990
What the hell?

509
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,283
That's disgusting.

510
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,287
The taxidermist is dead.
I confirmed it myself.

511
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:53,375
But Sergeant Tsukishima,
who was with him, is a hardy soldier.

512
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,879
If he didn't die in the mine,

513
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,883
we have to assume
they'll start planting the fake skins.

514
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,433
They forgot to take this.

515
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,313
But is it real or fake?

516
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,567
We need a way to tell them apart.

517
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,543
The five skins before you are fake.

518
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,215
The other two are real.
Edogai's and the one we lent him.

519
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:47,304
It is every artist's dream
to leave a lasting legacy with their art.

520
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:54,353
The bigger the impact on the world,
the greater the achievement.

521
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,273
Excellent work, Edogai.

522
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,488
Before he died,
Edogai said he had a message for you.

523
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,740
What is it?

524
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,207
I have one last message for him.

525
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,336
"Iron."

526
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,383
Tell Mr. Tsurumi, "iron."

527
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,718
"Iron"?

528
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:31,598
I know he'll be able to figure it out.

529
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,143
Iron?

530
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,067
Edogai was very particular
about using tannins for tanning.

531
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,289
He never told anyone else
about his preference, only me.

532
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,627
<i>Just be careful when the skin is wet.</i>

533
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,922
It'll change color
under certain circumstances.

534
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,568
The tannin seeped into the water
and reacted with the iron.

535
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,822
So this is Edogai's final message.

536
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,783
Now I can tell the skins apart.

537
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,039
Five fake skins
obtained in exchange for his life.

538
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,875
They won't go to waste.

539
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,795
Nice work.

540
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,924
Get some rest, Tsukishima.

541
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:48,926
Yes, sir.

542
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,750
Are they here to destroy the evidence?

543
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,293
Saichi Sugimoto!

544
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,587
You can't trust a traitor.

545
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,715
At this rate, her life will be in danger.

546
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,676
I know of someone.

547
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,302
I need you.

548
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,055
This is my purpose in life.
Time to repay my debt.

549
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,849
I want to see her get to the truth.

550
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,388
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

551
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,015
