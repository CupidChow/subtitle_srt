00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,807
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:21,021
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,356
203 METER HILL

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,026
I'm

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,611
Immortal Sugimoto!

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,326
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,620
I need money.

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>Sugimoto learns that the tattoos</i>
<i>on the Abashiri Prison escapees</i>

9
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>show where the Ainu gold is hidden.</i>

10
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,297
<i>With the help of Asirpa, an Ainu girl,</i>

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>and Shiraishi, one of the convicts,</i>
<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

12
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,470
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

13
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,389
I'll find out why my <i>aca </i>had to be killed.

14
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,433
I'll find the truth.

15
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,020
We will find the gold.

16
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,521
Yeah.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>But they weren't the only ones</i>
<i>looking for the tattoos.</i>

18
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>Toshizo Hijikata,</i>
<i>one of the escaped convicts,</i>

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,282
<i>had been recruiting members</i>
<i>to look for the gold.</i>

20
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>The Seventh Division, led by Tsurumi,</i>
<i>wants the gold to start a military regime.</i>

21
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>The two factions join the hunt,</i>
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:31,174
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of their grueling journey</i>

23
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,719
<i>to be the first to collect all 24 tattoos</i>

24
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,223
<i>and find the hidden trove of Ainu gold.</i>

25
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,774
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

26
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,256
Refresh my memory.
How many tattoos do we have now?

27
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,968
<i>The guy killed by a bear.</i>

28
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,805
<i>The one shot in the head</i>
<i>by a Seventh Division soldier.</i>

29
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,683
<i>The hunter who was after the wolf.</i>

30
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>The serial killer</i>
<i>at the herring fishing site.</i>

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,147
<i>And finally,</i>

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>the klutz who keeps getting captured</i>
<i>after escaping.</i>

33
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,235
That's me, the Escape King.

34
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,572
There are 24 convicts with tattoos, right?

35
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,991
We have five tattoos.

36
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>Does Lt. Tsurumi only have</i>
<i>the one you saw, Shiraishi?</i>

37
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,456
<i>I can't say for sure.</i>

38
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,419
<i>Toshizo Hijikata is gathering a party</i>
<i>to collect the tattoos, right?</i>

39
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>He'll attack us at some point.</i>

40
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,217
What's with the gloomy face, Shiraishi?

41
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,386
Stomachache?

42
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,638
No, it's nothing.

43
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,600
Look, Sugimoto.

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,810
Lovely Adonis flowers are blooming.

45
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,978
How precious.

46
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,814
Spring is here.

47
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,774
<i>Cirayapappo</i>.

48
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,444
It means "huchen flowers."

49
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,279
Huchen? As in the fish?

50
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,948
Huchen come out in spring.

51
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,077
When these flowers bloom, that means
huchen are swimming up the river.

52
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,331
I heard huchen is delicious.

53
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,042
They say it tastes like tuna.

54
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,086
Can we get one somehow?

55
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,214
Asirpa, any ideas?

56
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,633
We need a trap.

57
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,927
Catch one for us, Asirpa!

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,035
Someone's there.

59
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,954
Look!

60
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,248
He must be catching huchen!

61
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,416
Let's try to trade for one.

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,376
Wait.

63
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,503
Kiroranke <i>nispa</i>!

64
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,550
Is that you, Asirpa?

65
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,427
Is he from your village?

66
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,846
No, he's from another <i>kotan</i>.

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,473
An old friend of my <i>aca</i>.

68
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
Your father's friend?

69
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,979
That makes things easy.

70
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,234
Hey, you!

71
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,903
Can you give us one of your huchen?

72
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,197
I'll give you candy for it.

73
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,826
Catch one yourself.
I'll lend you my fishing net.

74
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,038
All you have to do is scoop up a fish
caught in the <i>tes</i>.

75
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,206
Seriously?

76
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,708
That's too much trouble.

77
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,129
Asirpa's been feeding you all this time.
You could at least try.

78
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,840
Come here a sec.

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,633
So,

80
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,969
how many have you caught?

81
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,805
Sell us the biggest one you have.

82
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,307
Asirpa will pay for it.

83
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,397
Shiraishi!

84
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,941
Catch a big one, okay?

85
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,862
The bigger the salmon, the tastier it is.

86
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,948
Same goes for huchen
since they're like salmon.

87
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,534
Seriously? What a pain.

88
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,458
Shiraishi!

89
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,043
What the hell are you doing?!

90
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,921
Help! The current is too strong!

91
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,426
Sugimoto!

92
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,636
The river's carrying me away! Help!

93
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,930
One, two, pull!

94
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:53,436
Pull!

95
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,481
-Huchen!
-Huchen!

96
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,400
It's the biggest one today!

97
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,699
EPISODE 3: COMPANION

98
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,700
Whew.

99
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,787
I'd be dead if it wasn't for you.

100
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,038
I'm Kiroranke.

101
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:13,873
I'm Shiraishi.

102
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
Thanks, Kiro.

103
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:22,298
Ainu men always share their tobacco
when they meet someone for the first time.

104
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,300
Really?

105
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,692
Its skin is really thick.

106
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,612
Huchen skin can be used to make clothes.

107
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,573
What? You make clothes out of fish?

108
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,036
<i>Cepur</i>, clothes made out of fish skin,
keep out wind and rain.

109
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,998
We also make shoes and knife scabbards
from fish skin.

110
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,127
In that case,
we should set the skin aside.

111
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,213
Here's the thing.

112
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,007
With huchen…

113
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,761
the skin is the tastiest part.

114
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
Should we use the skin to make things?

115
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,559
Or should we eat it?

116
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,895
I can't decide.

117
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,150
I say we eat it.

118
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,575
Looks delicious.

119
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,328
It's going to be a feast.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,667
It should be cooked now.

121
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,594
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

122
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,939
The thick skin becomes tender
once it's grilled.

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,817
It's so fragrant and <i>hinna</i>.

124
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,736
Yes, huchen is <i>hinna</i>.

125
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,830
The eyeballs are delicious.
They taste like boiled octopus.

126
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,917
When we catch a fish,
we pluck its eyes out and suck on them.

127
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,253
Children fight to claim the eyes
as their snack.

128
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,589
You can eat it, Sugimoto.

129
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,941
Is it <i>hinna</i>, Sugimoto?
Are you grateful for the eyeball?

130
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,068
<i>Hinna</i>.

131
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,696
"Sugimoto"?

132
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,075
Immortal Sugimoto?

133
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,285
Why do you know that?

134
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,329
I was with the Seventh Division.

135
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,957
-You work for Lt. Tsurumi?
-Sugimoto.

136
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,001
Lieutenant Tsurumi?

137
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,464
No, I wasn't in his platoon.

138
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,677
And I had already left the army.
I have nothing to do with them now.

139
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,639
That makes sense.

140
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,393
The Seventh Division
consists of 20,000 soldiers.

141
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,979
Not everyone served under Lt. Tsurumi.

142
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,276
I knew you had to be Immortal Sugimoto
from your name and the scars on your face.

143
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,654
I wasn't expecting to meet
a war hero out here.

144
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,450
Toraji!

145
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,746
Toraji.

146
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,914
Don't go!

147
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,083
Toraji!

148
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,127
Toraji!

149
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,671
<i>I'm not a war hero.</i>

150
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,382
I'm just someone who failed to die.

151
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,263
Asirpa, why are you with these men?

152
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,100
He's my partner.

153
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,812
As for Shiraishi,

154
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,355
he's useless.

155
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,775
I see.

156
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,321
They must be worthy of your trust.

157
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,991
You've always been a clever child.

158
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,245
The last time we met…

159
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
was at your father's funeral.

160
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,340
Asirpa, there's something
I need to tell you.

161
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,012
I know about what happened

162
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,057
in Abashiri Prison.

163
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,603
How did you find out?

164
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,983
<i>One day,</i>

165
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,862
<i>an old man who claimed to have been</i>
<i>in Abashiri Prison</i>

166
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,530
<i>came to my village.</i>

167
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,953
<i>He said he was looking for a girl.</i>

168
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,502
Her name is Asuko Kochobe.

169
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,962
Do you know her?

170
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,925
How did he know that name?

171
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,389
Who's Asuko Kochobe?

172
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,475
It's my Japanese name.

173
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,312
Your Japanese name?

174
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,190
The only people who know it

175
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,151
are my late parents.

176
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,367
You've heard of Noppera-Bo,
the man behind the tattoos, right?

177
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,123
<i>He gave the old man</i>

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,460
<i>a clue as to how to decipher the tattoos.</i>

179
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,257
<i>"Asuko Kochobe, in Otaru."</i>

180
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,260
<i>In other words,</i>

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,180
he wants you, Asirpa, to have the gold.

182
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,308
Me?

183
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,651
Who is Noppera-Bo, exactly?

184
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,533
Are you saying…

185
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,246
<i>Noppera-Bo…</i>

186
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,876
<i>is Asirpa's father.</i>

187
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,095
My <i>aca</i>?

188
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,730
He killed other Ainu and stole the gold?

189
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,733
I don't believe you.

190
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,786
<i>I'll</i>

191
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,414
<i>find out why my </i>aca <i>had to be killed.</i>

192
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>I'll find the truth.</i>

193
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,343
How are you so sure
Noppera-Bo is Asirpa's father?

194
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,432
You're on your way back
to Asirpa's <i>kotan</i>, right?

195
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,268
I'll tell you the rest when we get there.

196
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,564
The sun is about to set.

197
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,692
It's going to be a cold night.

198
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,996
I'm fine.

199
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,503
See you.

200
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,012
Granny, I'm back.

201
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,141
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>!

202
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,060
What's up, Osoma?

203
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,660
Granny here… has stiff shoulders.

204
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,665
Private First Class Genjiro Tanigaki.

205
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,044
Why are you dressed like that?

206
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,630
There was an <i>amappo.</i>

207
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,594
A poisoned bow trap that paralyzed me.
The Ainu saved my life.

208
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,890
I see you can walk now.

209
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,101
Why didn't you report back to Lt. Tsurumi?

210
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,939
I wanted to stay a little longer
to repay the Ainu for their help.

211
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,320
Corporal Tamai

212
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,822
is missing.

213
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,825
Noma and Okada too.

214
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,495
Not a single person in your group
reported back.

215
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,334
We went after suspicious hunters.

216
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,627
I got separated.

217
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,005
I thought the rest of the team
reported back without me.

218
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,055
You must have heard from Corporal Tamai.

219
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,183
Heard about what?
Leave her alone, Nikaido!

220
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,852
You killed the others, didn't you?

221
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,481
Well, Tanigaki?

222
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,985
I'd never do that.

223
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,534
Did you

224
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,454
just look at your gun?

225
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,750
Don't bother.

226
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,045
You can't use it without this.

227
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,271
Superior Private Ogata, sir.

228
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,441
Please don't hurt the villagers.

229
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,659
I was joking.

230
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,831
I accused you of killing the others
to test your reaction.

231
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,252
If you want to stay
and repay your debt, go ahead.

232
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,837
I'll pretend I didn't see you.

233
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,672
Let's go, Nikaido.

234
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,386
By the way…

235
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,559
have you seen Immortal Sugimoto?

236
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,189
He's working with an Ainu girl.
They have tattooed skins.

237
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,611
I ran into them nearby,
and this is the closest village.

238
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,741
I haven't seen him.

239
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,953
I see.

240
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,505
I can't stay here.

241
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,844
Granny, I have to go now.

242
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,847
I'm sorry I can't repay your kindness.

243
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,515
Are you hungry?

244
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,187
Osoma, tell Granny for me.

245
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,189
I have to leave right away.

246
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,775
Osoma, please!

247
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,738
Granny…

248
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,076
Are you leaving?

249
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,747
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>.

250
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,009
Get down, Osoma!

251
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,345
Don't move!

252
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,890
That sound…

253
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,233
You missed.

254
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,362
Perhaps we should've killed him
in the hut.

255
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,699
We would've had to kill the witnesses too.

256
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,912
I love my grandma.
The old woman reminded me of her.

257
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,582
Tanigaki is an honest man.

258
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,295
I knew he wouldn't agree
with our plan to betray Lt. Tsurumi.

259
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,714
I warned Corporal Tamai about it.

260
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,010
<i>Tanigaki must've killed</i>
<i>Corporal Tamai and the others</i>

261
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,930
<i>after they failed to get him on our side.</i>

262
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,560
<i>He was biding his time</i>
<i>at the Ainu village,</i>

263
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,940
waiting to make a full recovery before
reporting our treachery to Lt. Tsurumi.

264
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,487
Movement in the rightmost window.

265
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,781
They closed the window.

266
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,074
No surprise there.

267
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,495
Why are they shooting at us?

268
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,372
I can only think of one reason

269
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,125
for them to kill me.

270
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,215
One of our men has expressed doubts
about Lt. Tsurumi's aspirations.

271
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,637
The Seventh Division is made up of
migrants from all over Japan.

272
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,765
We may have bonded through the war,

273
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,143
but we're fragile at the core.

274
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,022
Are you saying
there is a traitor among us?

275
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,649
Who?

276
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,569
I don't know.

277
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,491
If a coup happens, whose side are you on?

278
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,202
Well, Tanigaki?

279
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,002
<i>He was talking about</i>
<i>Superior Private Ogata.</i>

280
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,964
<i>I can't believe Corporal Tamai</i>
<i>wanted to betray Lt. Tsurumi.</i>

281
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,093
They are no longer my comrade-in-arms.

282
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,556
They're my enemies.

283
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,394
Movement in the left window.

284
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,856
Binoculars. He's watching us.

285
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,736
It's a hit.

286
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,115
-Why didn't he scream?
-It must've been a feint.

287
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,958
He's throwing stuff out of the window.

288
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,879
Embers from the hearth,
wrapped in grass mats.

289
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,673
A smoke screen?

290
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,760
Or a pathetic attempt at one.

291
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,429
There's barely any smoke.

292
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
Let's move.

293
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,393
But the smoke screen doesn't affect us.

294
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,105
He did that on purpose
to distract us and keep us from moving.

295
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,233
He'll try to escape out of sight.

296
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,368
Granny, sorry for ruining your wall.

297
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,495
I promise to come back and fix it.

298
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,666
Gods,

299
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,044
please look over Mr. Tanigaki

300
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:42,551
and protect him from harm.

301
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:53,895
Asirpa told me to hide this
where Ryu sleeps to comfort him.

302
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,858
This is…

303
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,157
Tetsuzo Nihei's single-shot rifle.

304
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,577
<i>It can only hold one bullet.</i>

305
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,579
That gun is obsolete.

306
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,373
<i>If you don't kill it in one shot,</i>
<i>you're dead.</i>

307
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,500
No second chances!

308
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,053
There's a hole.

309
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,804
Sneaky bastard!

310
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,140
He got us.

311
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,184
No matter.

312
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,103
He won't get far in his condition.

313
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,692
Let's go Tanigaki hunting.

314
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,918
I have only one bullet.
The last one you loaded.

315
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,840
I'll make them regret
not killing me in one shot.

316
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,200
A bear did this.

317
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,245
This may be useful.

318
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,254
Where did that bastard go?

319
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,506
He's a <i>matagi</i>.

320
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,386
He knows how to run and hide
from pursuers in the mountains.

321
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,182
Is this really necessary?

322
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:59,062
Even if we kill him,
we can't return to Lt. Tsurumi.

323
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,025
Tanigaki might tell Lt. Tsurumi
about the other traitors.

324
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,948
We need spies in the group
if we want to find the gold.

325
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,368
We have to silence Tanigaki.

326
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,496
I don't care

327
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,541
about the gold anymore.

328
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,087
I just want to

329
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,924
kill Saichi Sugimoto as soon as possible!

330
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,225
Smoke from a campfire.

331
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,771
Must be some other hunter.

332
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,773
Tanigaki isn't that dumb.

333
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,277
Let's check.

334
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,375
Go check it out.

335
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,170
Signal me if you pick up his trail.

336
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,006
What am I, bait?

337
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,634
Give me your binoculars.

338
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,636
I'll cover you.

339
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:20,310
It's within a hundred meters.
No matter who approaches, I won't miss.

340
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,104
Tanigaki doesn't have a gun.

341
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,983
What if he throws a big rock at me?

342
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,402
Shut up and get going.

343
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,981
There are crutch marks on the ground.

344
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,483
I'm sure it's Tanigaki.

345
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,153
Unbelievable.

346
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,783
He was here eating venison
without a care in the world.

347
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,334
It's definitely a trap.

348
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,516
It's nice and warm.

349
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,103
I'm hungry.

350
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,063
Maybe I'll take a bite.

351
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,486
It's here.

352
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,405
A bear?

353
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,586
What's wrong, Ogata?
Aren't you gonna save him?

354
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,428
Damn you, Ogata! Just shoot it already!

355
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,601
Shoot it.

356
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,271
Ogata!

357
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,752
I'm right here, Tanigaki.

358
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,298
Well? Are you gonna
hit me with a big rock?

359
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,277
Boner!

360
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,071
BONER

361
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,989
Don't move, Tanigaki.

362
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,450
That voice…

363
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,661
Mishima?

364
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,122
Yeah.

365
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,290
Why are you here?

366
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,336
I've been tailing Ogata and Nikaido.

367
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,590
<i>I report their location to Lt. Tsurumi.</i>

368
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,804
<i>Lt. Tsurumi put them on a long leash</i>
<i>to flush out the other traitors.</i>

369
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,266
Too bad you killed them.

370
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,059
I…

371
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,936
I know.

372
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,273
You didn't betray us.
That's why they tried to kill you.

373
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,695
Let's head back. One of our men
went to report what happened.

374
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,822
Lt. Tsurumi should be nearby--

375
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,912
Damn it.

376
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,622
He's still alive?

377
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,332
Mishima, eh?

378
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,670
I was so sure we weren't followed.

379
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,385
I got distracted hunting Tanigaki.

380
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,355
Don't shoot him in the head.

381
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,332
He's here already? Talk about perceptive.

382
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,922
I can see why the higher-ups see him as
a threat instead of an asset to the army.

383
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,177
There he is!

384
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,720
After him!

385
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,891
It's Mishima.

386
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,231
Nikaido is alive.

387
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,690
Good.

388
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,444
Go ahead and shoot Ogata's brains out.

389
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,612
Yes, sir!

390
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,285
Shoot him!

391
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,144
He's distracting our men
by making them tend to the wounded.

392
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,730
Hyakunosuke Ogata.

393
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,984
It's too bad we have to kill him.

394
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,033
Find him!

395
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,535
Spread out!

396
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,892
There he is!

397
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,234
Time to retreat.

398
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,956
Let me see…

399
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,755
No, the balance is off.

400
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,553
They say you need a symmetrical face
if you want to be handsome.

401
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,027
Who else is a traitor?!

402
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,119
Give me their names, Nikaido.

403
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,379
I knew it.

404
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,840
This is the nose of a traitor.

405
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,719
That explains why
I've always found it repulsive.

406
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,932
I'll cut up your face
and use it as a jigsaw puzzle.

407
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,770
I hope you enjoy piecing it together
with your men,

408
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,439
Lt. Tsurumi, <i>sir</i>.

409
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,114
I'll let you kill Sugimoto.

410
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,203
Komiya is a traitor!

411
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,374
He's lying!

412
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,503
So that's why I don't like that nose.

413
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,089
No, please.

414
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,258
Wait.

415
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,619
Got it.

416
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,958
We lost Superior Private Ogata.

417
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,003
I'm not surprised,
considering who his father is.

418
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,838
I'll go finish him off.

419
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,675
He's after the tattoos too.
We'll soon get another chance to kill him.

420
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,594
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

421
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,982
Saichi Sugimoto…

422
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,780
I'm home.

423
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,619
Come in and rest. Have some tea.

424
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,703
Granny, I'm back.

425
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,623
Huh?

426
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,542
No way. That you, Tanigaki?

427
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,961
I see you made yourself at home.

428
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,632
Oh, this? My uniform stands out,
so I decided to wear an <i>attus</i>.

429
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,554
It's surprisingly comfortable
for something made out of tree bark.

430
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,270
What's she doing?

431
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,189
That's a <i>kisarari</i>.
It means "long-eared monster."

432
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,818
You stand outside a window,
wave it around,

433
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,947
and make terrifying noises
through your teeth to scare children.

434
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,491
Try it.

435
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,764
You're terrible.

436
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,727
You have zero talent for this. Sit down.

437
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,074
Mommy!

438
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,000
Osoma wet herself.

439
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,675
Will you tell us the rest now?

440
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,847
Should I leave the room?

441
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,061
Tanigaki, I heard you protected
Huci and Osoma.

442
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,687
Thank you.

443
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,899
Don't thank me.
It was my fault they were in danger.

444
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,486
If you're not going back to Lt. Tsurumi,

445
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,904
you can stay here.

446
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,826
That <i>tonkori </i>brings back memories.

447
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,704
I got it in Karafuto.

448
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,918
A long time ago…

449
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,049
I came to Japan with Wilk,
Asirpa's father.

450
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,468
"Came to Japan"?

451
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,933
In the easternmost part of Russia,
along the Amur River basin and Karafuto,

452
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,435
there are many small tribes

453
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,898
whose lifestyles are not so different
from the Hokkaido Ainu.

454
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,153
When we were much younger men,

455
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,490
Wilk and I crossed the sea to come here.

456
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,955
We married Ainu women in Hokkaido

457
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,291
and had children.

458
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,592
I'm looking for a girl.

459
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,180
Her name is Asuko Kochobe.

460
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,433
Do you know her?

461
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,894
This is an Ainu village.

462
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,856
You should look in a Japanese town.

463
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,109
It's her Japanese name.

464
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,320
Her father told me.

465
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,033
Her Ainu name is

466
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,869
Asirpa.

467
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,124
Her father claimed to be Ainu.

468
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,794
It seems you know him.

469
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,841
That man died five years ago.

470
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,263
He told me…

471
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,143
to see for myself
when I meet his daughter.

472
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,942
He said his daughter has blue eyes,
just like him.

473
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:32,328
He said he was an Ainu
of Polish and Karafuto Ainu descent.

474
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:41,504
I don't know anything about his daughter.
That convict must be an imposter.

475
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:49,220
You should head north if you're looking
for an Ainu with Russian blood.

476
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,692
What do you know about the gold?

477
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,115
I haven't heard from Asirpa's father
for a very long time.

478
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:17,123
I find it hard to believe Noppera-Bo
stole the Ainu gold out of pure greed.

479
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,501
What did he want it for?

480
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,171
I don't know.

481
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,550
People change,
and I haven't seen him for so long.

482
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,637
Asirpa,

483
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,641
do the tattoos remind you of anything?

484
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,189
You're the only one
who can decipher the code, right?

485
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,069
Even if that's true,
we need to collect all the tattoos first.

486
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,988
That can wait.

487
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,491
I'm going to meet Noppera-Bo.

488
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,452
Asirpa…

489
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,372
I want to see with my own eyes
whether Noppera-Bo is Aca.

490
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,583
If he really is Aca,

491
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,461
he'll tell me everything.

492
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,172
I'll go with you.

493
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,049
We're partners, after all.

494
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,012
Besides,

495
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,432
it's easier to ask him
than catch all the escaped convicts.

496
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,685
We know where Noppera-Bo is.

497
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,815
It's not as easy as that.

498
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,193
Listen.

499
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,988
Abashiri Prison is heavily guarded.

500
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,823
Plus,

501
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:37,536
<i>they cut Noppera-Bo's Achilles tendon</i>
<i>so he can't walk properly.</i>

502
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,081
<i>The guards who watch him</i>
<i>are also after the gold.</i>

503
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,335
You wanna meet him?

504
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,795
Not gonna happen.

505
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,384
Unless you have
the Escape King to help you.

506
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,303
Shiraishi.

507
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,056
The Escape King?

508
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,058
What's that?

509
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:10,194
Shiraishi escaped from Abashiri Prison.

510
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,654
He has a tattoo.

511
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,366
Him?

512
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,250
I see.

513
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,086
The convicts have to be skinned.

514
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,130
Is it that obvious?

515
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,885
Only Wilk would do something like this.
It has to be him.

516
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,429
I'm going too.

517
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,600
It'll be dangerous.
Sure you want to leave your family behind?

518
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,310
It's for my family.

519
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>My children were born here</i>
<i>and will live on as Ainu.</i>

520
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,945
<i>Wilk and I are from the same country.</i>

521
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,865
<i>I feel responsible</i>
<i>for his theft of the Ainu gold.</i>

522
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,912
You can have your due share.

523
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,873
The rest should be returned to the Ainu.

524
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,501
I want to see this to the end.

525
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,922
Let's go together.

526
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,599
Asahikawa lies between here and Abashiri.

527
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,187
ASAHIKAWA

528
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,356
<i>The Seventh Division HQ is located there.</i>

529
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,944
<i>Lt. Tsurumi has allies</i>
<i>within the headquarters.</i>

530
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,488
Don't go near there.

531
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,492
In that case, we'll go to Sapporo first.

532
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,538
We'll bypass Asahikawa
and head to Abashiri from the south.

533
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,374
OTARU - SAPPORO - ASAHIKAWA - ABASHIRI

534
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,918
ABASHIRI

535
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,891
That's a dangerous weapon you have there.
It's a grenade, right?

536
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,144
It has less gunpowder
than a normal grenade.

537
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,229
I was a combat engineer.

538
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,651
When I was at 203 Meter Hill,
I helped blow up Russian fortifications

539
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,111
by making lots of improvised grenades.

540
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,238
I see.

541
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,491
Glad to have you on the team.

542
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,044
Tanigaki, take care of Huci for me.

543
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,128
I will.

544
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,091
She's done so much for me.
I'll work hard to repay her kindness.

545
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,679
Ready to go to Abashiri?

546
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,019
Why is my horse so small?

547
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,479
Sorry, Shiraishi.

548
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,606
All we had left was that Dosanko.

549
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,327
Don't worry, Granny.

550
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,914
Asirpa has Immortal Sugimoto
looking out for her.

551
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,560
Hey,

552
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,479
are you sure we can trust him?

553
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,984
I don't think he told us
the whole truth about Noppera-Bo.

554
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,278
Whatever.

555
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,282
Let's find a nice place to stay in Sapporo
and have a drink or two.

556
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,554
Sugimoto, he's a tattooed convict!

557
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,764
You're an old man?

558
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,223
Those beautiful eyes…

559
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,516
I want them.

560
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,809
Ms. Ienaga, sleep with me.

561
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,479
His body will take me
one step closer to perfection.

562
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,898
-Why are you here?
-Toshizo Hijikata said that?

563
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,317
There are no useless geezers,
only survivors.

564
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,902
But I can at least have fun.

565
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,029
Ms. Ienaga!

566
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,235
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

567
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,904
