00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>During the Meiji era,</i>

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,520
<i>there were rumors of a massive trove</i>
<i>of Ainu gold hidden somewhere in Hokkaido.</i>

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,856
203 METER HILL

4
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,111
I'm Immortal Sugimoto!

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>After surviving the Russo-Japanese War,</i>
<i>Saichi Sugimoto heads to Hokkaido.</i>

6
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,370
I need money.

7
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:42,667
<i>Sugimoto learns that the tattoos</i>
<i>on the Abashiri Prison escapees</i>

8
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>show where the Ainu gold is hidden.</i>

9
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,547
<i>With the help of Asirpa, an Ainu girl,</i>

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,176
<i>and Shiraishi, one of the convicts,</i>
<i>Sugimoto sets out to collect the tattoos.</i>

11
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,219
I want to fulfill my promise to Toraji.

12
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,139
I'll find out why my <i>aca </i>had to be killed.

13
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,183
I'll find the truth.

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,770
We will find the gold.

15
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,271
Yeah.

16
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>But they weren't the only ones</i>
<i>looking for the tattoos.</i>

17
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>Toshizo Hijikata,</i>
<i>one of the escaped convicts,</i>

18
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>had been recruiting members</i>
<i>to look for the gold.</i>

19
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,913
<i>The Seventh Division, led by Tsurumi,</i>
<i>wants the gold to start a military regime.</i>

20
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,918
<i>The two factions join the hunt,</i>
<i>eager to get their hands on the gold.</i>

21
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,632
I heard there are 24 of us
with the tattoos.

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,469
<i>After acquiring Nihei's tattoo,</i>

23
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:38,515
<i>Sugimoto's group now has four tattoos.</i>

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,018
<i>Hijikata's group has two.</i>

25
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,606
<i>The Seventh Division,</i>
<i>led by Tsurumi, has one.</i>

26
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,192
<i>Seventeen tattoos left.</i>

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,031
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of their grueling journey</i>

28
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,243
<i>to be the first to collect all 24 tattoos</i>

29
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,788
<i>and find the hidden trove of Ainu gold.</i>

00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,798
GOLDEN KAMUY
-THE HUNT OF PRISONERS IN HOKKAIDO-

31
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
Look, Ryu.

32
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,473
Here.

33
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,059
Check this out.

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,895
This is Mr. Lonely Sock. Look, Ryu.

35
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,147
Go on, sniff it.

36
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,732
Yes, that's it.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,109
Ready? Let's go.

38
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,159
This way?

39
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:48,501
It's hard to believe, but this sock is
gonna lead us to 20,000 kan of gold.

40
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,087
Who would've thought?

41
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,714
Okay, let's go.

42
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,310
Hey, Ryu! Let me talk to the ladies!

43
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,694
Guess you're only good
for tracking bears, huh?

44
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,168
What is it?

45
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,809
Well done, Ryu.

46
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,736
Sugimoto, look.

47
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,447
-<i>Makayo</i>. Butterbur shoot.
-Oh.

48
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,907
There's a <i>terkeype </i>too.

49
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,617
The Ezo brown frog?

50
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,494
Spring is coming.

51
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
That's not a spring tradition, is it?

52
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,360
They found another body

53
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,904
on the Shakotan coast.

54
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:45,285
The victim was another migrant worker
at a herring fishery.

55
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,080
I believe we know who the killer is.

56
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,292
Kazuo Henmi.

57
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:58,589
He's killed at least 100 people
and never stays in one place for long.

58
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,135
I thought Tetsuzo Nihei
was a loose cannon,

59
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,971
but he's nothing compared to Kazuo Henmi.

60
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,774
Hey, wait!

61
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,627
Ouch! Huh?

62
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,803
Using weapons isn't fair, Shiraishi.

63
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,350
Don't kill him, Ushiyama.

64
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,371
I'm impressed you found us.

65
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,290
Shiraishi,

66
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,335
you're not working alone, are you?

67
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,221
No.

68
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,599
I'm working with Immortal Sugimoto.

69
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,643
"Immortal Sugimoto"?

70
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,146
An interesting nickname.

71
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,857
-Let me go, or he'll make you pay.
-So…

72
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,237
How many tattoos have you collected?

73
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,283
Just the one on my back.

74
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,004
Go to the Otaru fishing port.

75
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,382
Fishing port?

76
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,721
Kazuo Henmi is probably hiding
among the migrant herring fishermen.

77
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,600
You want us to get his skin for you?

78
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,020
Be grateful we're letting you live.

79
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,566
We'll make a copy of your tattoo.

80
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,946
You don't have a choice.

81
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,785
Continue hunting the tattoos
with your partner, as usual.

82
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,040
Be our spy.

83
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,924
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,934
<i>Yaren, soran, soran…</i>

85
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,520
<i>Otaru, early spring.</i>

86
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,316
<i>Large swarms of herring have arrived</i>
<i>for the spawning season.</i>

87
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,279
<i>The herring have come</i>
<i>The gulls cry out</i>

88
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,825
<i>The ocean gleams with silver scales</i>

89
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,914
<i>Choi yasae enya-sa-no</i>

90
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,415
<i>Heave-ho</i>

91
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,668
<i>Hey, heave-ho, heave-ho</i>

92
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,699
That guy showed up two days ago.

93
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,536
He doesn't talk to anyone. What a weirdo.

94
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,539
That's not all. Guess what I saw?

95
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,834
He has a tattoo on his chest.

96
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,799
Most of the people who come here
to work as day laborers

97
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,969
have been dealt a bad hand in life.

98
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,680
We shouldn't gossip about him.

99
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,098
You think so?

100
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,106
Have you heard of <i>yanshu</i>?

101
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:30,444
Migrants from Northeast Japan,
hired by fisheries along the Sea of Japan

102
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,613
just for the herring season.

103
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,995
<i>It's the perfect camouflage</i>
<i>for a convict looking to lie low.</i>

104
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,247
<i>Or it would be</i>

105
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>if it weren't for the recent</i>
<i>spate of killings at the fisheries.</i>

106
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,227
You there.

107
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,021
Hey, you!

108
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,565
Wanna drink with us?

109
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,733
You can sit here.

110
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,692
<i>I'm certain</i>

111
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,779
<i>the killer is a man called Kazuo Henmi.</i>

112
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,493
Not very friendly, is he?

113
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,163
Right? He's so creepy.

114
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,290
Why are you so sure?

115
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,085
Because of the word

116
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,130
carved into the bodies.

117
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,383
Sugimoto…

118
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,344
Is the word…

119
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,681
<i>"Eye"?</i>

120
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,435
<i>We saw a similar body today.</i>

121
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,899
Kazuo Henmi must've done it.

122
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,236
Our fifth tattoo, huh?

123
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,366
You'll find him in Otaru.

124
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,043
It's freezing!

125
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,131
The nights are still chilly.

126
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,259
You're always alone.

127
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,596
Why don't you drink with us?

128
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,348
Leave me alone.

129
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,537
What a letdown.

130
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,331
Just another yakuza.

131
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,919
I'm afraid you're not the one
I'm waiting for.

132
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,426
ABASHIRI PRISON ESCAPEE
KAZUO HENMI

133
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:45,389
EYE

134
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,897
EPISODE 2: FISHING FOR A KILLER

135
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,232
It's the sea!

136
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,947
What kind of man is Henmi?

137
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,990
Well,

138
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,826
he seemed normal when we first met.

139
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,663
You came here
just to meet Sister Miyazawa?

140
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,373
That's some dedication.

141
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,376
<i>He was well-mannered and friendly.</i>

142
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,004
<i>We hit it off right away.</i>

143
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,423
<i>Which is why</i>

144
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,929
<i>I felt a chill go down my spine</i>
<i>when a guard told me his true identity.</i>

145
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,774
<i>He didn't seem like a serial killer</i>
<i>who had killed over 100 people.</i>

146
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,076
One time, I asked him,
"Why'd you kill so many people?"

147
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:52,915
He told me what drove him to kill.
The trigger, so to speak.

148
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,125
-The trigger?
-Yeah.

149
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,588
There was a bamboo grove
behind the house he grew up in.

150
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,425
According to him, a huge boar lived in it.

151
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:08,138
That boar ate…

152
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,019
my little brother.

153
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,855
What?

154
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,818
My brother screamed
and fought desperately for his life.

155
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,779
All I could do was hide and watch.

156
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,576
Brutally killed
with no way of defending yourself…

157
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,122
I can't imagine the pain and fear.

158
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,964
My brother's eyes filled with despair
as the light in them faded away.

159
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,759
When I think of his eyes…

160
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,195
I get the urge to kill someone, anyone.

161
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,668
Is that why he carves the word "eye"?

162
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,045
Who knows?

163
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,298
I don't wanna know
what goes on inside his head.

164
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,176
Bathroom. Be right back.

165
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,598
If we're dealing with a ruthless killer,

166
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,392
I can skin him without feeling guilty.

167
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,144
Sugimoto.

168
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,481
No unnecessary killing, remember?

169
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,192
I know, Asirpa.

170
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's hope Henmi cooperates
and lets us copy his tattoo

171
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,074
without putting up a fight.

172
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,709
What's taking Shiraishi so long?

173
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,503
I bet he went to <i>osoma</i>.

174
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,964
Man overboard!

175
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,923
Is he okay?

176
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,302
What happened?

177
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,304
A whale hit that boat.

178
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,222
A whale?

179
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,766
-We gotta save him!
-The other boats are too far away.

180
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,851
-I'll go rescue him.
-How?

181
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,979
The sea is freezing cold.

182
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,023
I'll use that boat
to get to him before he freezes.

183
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,286
No!

184
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,918
The whale must've been chased
by a <i>repun kamuy.</i>

185
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,338
Whales gather to feed on herring
this time of year.

186
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,716
Orcas, <i>repun kamuy</i>, eat the whales.

187
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,469
No, not like this!

188
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,471
I refuse to…

189
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,597
Grab my hand!

190
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,307
…die like this!

191
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,020
No!

192
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,312
Hold still!

193
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,317
You all right?

194
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,861
Hang in there.

195
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,655
This isn't how I want to die.

196
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,158
Not like this!

197
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,543
It's warm.

198
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,295
You saved my life.

199
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,636
Your jacket isn't helping. Take it off
and let the fire warm your back.

200
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,098
You should do as she says.

201
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,611
Warm your back to warm your whole body.
We call it <i>setur sesekka</i>.

202
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,698
Take it all off.

203
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,047
Well, it's just that

204
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,675
I'd rather not strip in public.

205
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,095
I'm a bit shy.

206
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,390
Shy?

207
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,529
You can use this.

208
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,031
Really?

209
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,617
You're so nice.

210
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,083
It smells

211
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,836
just like me.

212
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,715
Does it stink?
I haven't washed it in ages.

213
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,558
The scent of a killer.

214
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,519
What? I didn't catch that.

215
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,831
This… must be fate.

216
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,335
I feel like I've been waiting for you
my whole life.

217
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,629
Don't be dramatic.

218
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,798
I was just passing by.

219
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,719
What's a soldier like you doing here?

220
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,512
I'm looking for someone.

221
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,390
Seen a man with a strange tattoo?

222
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,184
Not a yakuza tattoo.

223
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,853
Lines with Japanese characters.

224
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,610
I knew it.

225
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,488
It's fate.

226
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,580
You okay there?

227
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,957
Oh, yes.

228
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,543
Thanks to you, I'm nice and warm now.

229
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,754
I'll go change at the lodge.

230
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,649
I want to

231
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,235
know more about him.

232
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,618
He's amazing.

233
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,621
Is he the one?

234
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,126
Will he give me
the brutal death I've been waiting for?

235
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,588
No, that's not it.

236
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
That's not it.

237
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,885
I have to fight him with all my strength.

238
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,972
Just like my brother.

239
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,933
I must fight.

240
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,567
I want to be killed!

241
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,622
Hey, you.

242
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,167
That's a unique tattoo.

243
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,921
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be working?

244
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,674
My cold got worse.

245
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,738
I've decided.
I'm going to try to kill him.

246
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,573
Yeah.

247
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,618
If he's the one I've been waiting for,

248
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,039
he won't be killed by me.

249
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,418
What the hell are you talking about?

250
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,171
You're not making any sense.

251
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,889
Hey.

252
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,435
Yes? How can I help you?

253
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,563
Can we stay here if we pay for lodging?

254
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,150
Oh… I'll ask about it.

255
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,365
-He says he'll ask.
-Okay.

256
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:04,132
The boss said you can stay at the lodge
if you work here.

257
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,804
Want to try carrying a <i>mokko</i>? Here.

258
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:15,894
PROFESSOR HENMI'S HERRING LECTURE
LESSON 1: CARRYING A MOKKO

259
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,565
We're paid according to
how much work we get done.

260
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,570
For <i>mokko </i>carriers, the more trips
we complete, the more money we make.

261
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,412
-It's heavy.
-Yeah.

262
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,124
Once these are dried and processed,

263
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,835
they become what's known as dried herring.

264
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,670
Herring doesn't keep well.

265
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,840
This way, the rest of Japan
gets to enjoy them too.

266
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,886
These meal blocks are what's left
after we extract the herring oil.

267
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,391
They need to be crushed
before they're dried.

268
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,977
PROFESSOR HENMI'S HERRING LECTURE
LESSON 3: HERRING MEAL BLOCKS

269
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,937
To cut the herring meal blocks,

270
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,775
we use this special knife.

271
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,903
Quite a big knife, isn't it?

272
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,616
You should give it a try.

273
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,785
Okay.

274
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,330
I just have to cut it?

275
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,251
It suits you well.

276
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,876
Sugimoto, we should meet up with Shiraishi
and go west to the next fishery.

277
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
He might not be here.

278
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,129
Yeah.

279
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,881
Huh?

280
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,716
Wait.

281
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,219
Why not eat something before you go?

282
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,386
We're good.

283
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,224
You saved my life.
Let me repay you with warm rice.

284
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,559
White rice?

285
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,275
We call this dish pickled herring.

286
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,155
Dried herring, cabbage, daikon,
and carrots, all fermented in malted rice.

287
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,866
Thanks.

288
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,307
It's delicious.

289
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,061
The sour herring
and sweet fermented vegetables

290
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,021
go well with rice.

291
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,482
It's <i>hinna</i>.

292
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,071
<i>Hinna</i>.

293
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,161
What's wrong, Asirpa?

294
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,248
Gotta go <i>osoma</i>.

295
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,249
Goodness.

296
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,918
Such terrible manners.

297
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,431
By the way,

298
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,684
were you at Port Arthur?

299
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,187
Yeah.

300
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,774
What was it like?

301
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,569
What do you mean?

302
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,407
I wanted to join the army,
but it wasn't meant to be.

303
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm curious.

304
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,538
Did you kill people?

305
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,669
Of course. It was war.

306
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,341
Do you remember how many you killed?

307
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,183
I remember it all, including
the faces of those I killed up close.

308
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,100
I see.

309
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,314
Why can't you forget?

310
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,609
Is it guilt?

311
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:41,076
I took their lives.
The least I can do is not forget them.

312
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,666
I killed them because I had to.

313
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,836
I'll be a monster if I have to.

314
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,298
In return,

315
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,967
when it's my time to die,

316
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,723
I don't expect to be granted
a peaceful death.

317
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,981
Wait.

318
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,734
Shit.

319
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,403
What's wrong?

320
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,447
EYE

321
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,782
What's this?

322
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,162
Sugimoto!

323
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,498
Henmi might be nearby!

324
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,756
Why did you drag me out here?

325
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,466
Let's go somewhere private.

326
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,593
No, I mean,

327
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,971
I want to show you something.

328
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,976
This is a meal pounder.

329
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,479
And this is a rake.

330
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:58,027
We use these to crush herring meal blocks
into small pieces for drying.

331
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,447
Which do you prefer?

332
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,533
Oh, I know.

333
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,537
I bet you prefer the knife.

334
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,207
Listen, we really have to go.

335
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,959
Thanks for the meal.

336
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,586
But I…

337
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,175
The Seventh Division?

338
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,635
Are you in trouble with them?

339
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,930
Yeah. Things will get ugly if they see me.

340
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,976
The bait I put out lured them here.

341
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,774
Let's hide in there.

342
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,692
It's the boss's mansion.

343
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,360
Quickly.

344
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,251
<i>During the late Meiji era,</i>

345
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:59,464
<i>the herring caught by fisheries</i>
<i>over the three months of spring</i>

346
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:04,010
<i>raked in over 2.5 billion yen</i>
<i>in today's money.</i>

347
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,991
Bravo, Mr. Tsurumi.

348
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,078
No one in this house can play the piano.

349
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,206
It must be thrilled to have you.

350
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,126
There was a time
when my family was fairly wealthy.

351
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,046
Life is full of ups and downs.

352
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:46,135
The same can be said for your business.
A bountiful catch may turn poor tomorrow.

353
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,015
In fact, the herring catch
in Northeast Japan is dwindling.

354
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,102
Herring is the only thing I know.

355
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,021
If the fishery goes to the dogs,

356
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,025
I shall rot together
with this herring mansion.

357
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,570
What else is there to say?

358
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,950
We can't read the minds of herring,
but we can manipulate the human heart.

359
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,080
With the right spark,
we can start a war on purpose.

360
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,127
Perhaps you'd like to invest
in the construction of my weapons factory.

361
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,963
I love weapons.

362
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,173
Behold!

363
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:30,221
I paid off someone in the army
for a Maxim machine gun.

364
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,598
Is that right?

365
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,850
Very nice.

366
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,481
Are we allowed in here?

367
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,985
It's an emergency. Let's go upstairs.

368
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:44,944
This way.

369
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,909
Let's go somewhere we can be alone.

370
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,090
That guy in the military cap…

371
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,926
Is that Immortal Sugimoto?

372
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,260
Oh.

373
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,764
You must be the boss's guests.

374
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,766
I've been looking for you.

375
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,852
Make yourselves at home
while I bring the tea.

376
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,854
That was Sugimoto, wasn't it?

377
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,231
Who? You're mistaken.

378
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,151
He's a fisherman
who's worked here for years.

379
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,069
Move.

380
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,463
<i>How beautiful.</i>

381
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,515
-Ouch.
-What happened?

382
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,519
That was beautiful.

383
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,603
They shot you?

384
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,566
-I was so scared!
-Let's get you patched up.

385
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,153
-You okay?
-Yeah.

386
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:15,952
Hang in there.

387
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,122
Immortal Sugimoto.

388
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,711
Lieutenant Tsurumi.

389
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,344
Here to steal my herring,
you thieving gulls?

390
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,471
I'll use you for target practice!

391
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,561
I'm immortal!

392
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,068
<i>So beautiful.</i>

393
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,535
I was captivated by the way
my brother fought to live.

394
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,874
I couldn't get enough of it,
so I became a serial killer.

395
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:18,264
<i>Whenever I see the bright shine of life</i>
<i>that refuses to give up…</i>

396
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,394
it reminds me of my brother.

397
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,483
I wanted to be like my brother.

398
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,200
Don't kill him. He's useful.

399
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,369
Capture Kazuo Henmi. Kill him if you must.

400
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,091
Shiraishi, the Seventh Division found us!

401
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,717
Say what?

402
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,052
Wait, what the hell?

403
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,595
That's Kazuo Henmi!

404
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,158
Asirpa.

405
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,577
Shiraishi, get ready to run!

406
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,495
Yes, ma'am!

407
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,166
<i>After resisting with all my strength,</i>

408
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,295
I want to be killed like my brother,
overcome by abject despair.

409
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,259
Long time no see!

410
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,998
"Immortal Sugimoto."

411
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,417
That's what they called you.

412
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,669
I think I know why.

413
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,298
You want to shine brightly in death too.

414
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,924
That's why you fight!

415
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,764
I want to be just like you.

416
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,393
So kill me, please!

417
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,441
I'll fight you with everything I have.

418
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,994
I'm not gonna die.

419
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,788
That's the spirit!

420
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,541
The stronger the conviction,

421
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,213
the bolder and brighter we shine!

422
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,883
Let's shine together, then.

423
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,310
You're amazing.

424
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,844
Ow! Let go!

425
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,263
Let go!

426
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,064
Sugimoto,

427
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,775
can I

428
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,280
count on you to never forget me?

429
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,246
I'll think of you
whenever I unroll your skin.

430
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,794
I'm so glad I lived

431
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,839
to experience this.

432
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,184
Crap, we gotta run.

433
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,814
<i>Wow.</i>

434
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,608
<i>He's so warm.</i>

435
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,164
I want to be brutally killed

436
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,791
just like my brother.

437
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,018
Stop it, you idiot!

438
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,561
Now's not the time!

439
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,528
Sugimoto…

440
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,157
Sugimoto…

441
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,752
Sugimoto!

442
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,554
Sugimoto!

443
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,643
Henmi!

444
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,245
Whoa!

445
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,046
What the hell?!

446
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,760
I don't believe it!

447
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,405
<i>Dying like this…</i>

448
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:58,289
<i>is… the best!</i>

449
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,778
Sugimoto!

450
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,779
Get on!

451
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,203
Hurry up!

452
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,164
We're gonna make 'em eat dust!

453
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,379
Enough. We won't catch them.

454
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,257
The other man
appears to be Yoshitake Shiraishi.

455
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,219
And that Ainu is still helping them.

456
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,764
Are you sure we should let them
take Kazuo Henmi?

457
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,349
It's fine.

458
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,602
Whales gather to feed on herring.

459
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,731
Orcas lurk in the shadows,
waiting to prey on the whales.

460
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:11,737
If you wish to eat the orcas,
do you become one yourself and fight them?

461
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:17,117
Or do you become a loathsome creature
that waits for all the killing to be over

462
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,745
before feeding on
the carcasses left behind?

463
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:31,632
Quite the lively crew
you've got there, Shiraishi.

464
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,830
You okay?

465
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,838
They won't find us here.

466
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,631
Check this out.

467
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,801
I managed to snag a premium delicacy!

468
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,057
When herring lay their eggs on kelp,
you get herring roe kelp.

469
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,769
Asirpa, wanna try some?

470
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,938
No, thanks. I had white rice.

471
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,274
What? When?

472
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,275
No fair!

473
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,653
Oh, some rice got on my sleeve. Want it?

474
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,128
Sugimoto, let's grab a bite.

475
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,838
I'm starving.

476
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,051
After I get the fifth tattoo.

477
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,753
I won't forget the way you shined.

478
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,803
He's the scariest of them all.

479
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,235
Yes, that's the spot. Right there.

480
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,196
Ouch.

481
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:03,158
This flew across the room and hit you.
I saw it with my own eyes.

482
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,036
Why would it fly across the room?!

483
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,039
Life is full of surprises.

484
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,584
Why not invest in us?
Any amount is welcome.

485
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,504
Rebuilding the house comes first.

486
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,840
Two men died in here.

487
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,635
My wife and daughter
won't be able to sleep at night.

488
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,394
Lieutenant Tsurumi.

489
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,275
Superior Private Hyakunosuke Ogata
vanished from the hospital.

490
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:42,823
And Private First Class Kohei Nikaido
has been missing for several days.

491
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,368
Looks like the rats are on the move.

492
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,003
<i>Sitat </i>birch bark makes good kindling.

493
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,505
We can sell it for money in town.

494
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:11,059
Tanigaki <i>nispa</i>, how's your leg?
You should take it easy.

495
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,022
I'm fine.
I need to start making myself useful.

496
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,941
Let's go.

497
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,198
Found him.

498
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,076
The man walking with the Ainu kids
is Tanigaki.

499
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,433
Good thing we found a place
to stay for the night.

500
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:55,145
Yeah, we'd freeze to death
if we slept on the beach.

501
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,941
And there's sake. This is heaven!

502
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,742
You don't look like migrant fishermen.

503
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,661
What?

504
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,204
I guess not.

505
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,584
What an adorable little girl.

506
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:23,715
She's about the same age…
as my grandchild.

507
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,927
Watch out. She's grumpy when she's sleepy.

508
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,807
Such beautiful eyes.

509
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,019
If I look closely,

510
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,565
I can see flecks of green
in her blue eyes.

511
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:48,073
I wonder if she has Russian blood in her?

512
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,575
What the hell?

513
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,201
What's wrong?

514
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,161
Huh? Oh, nothing.

515
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,710
I know someone with the same eyes.

516
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,302
What's her name?

517
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,179
Asirpa.

518
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,059
And her Japanese name?

519
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,228
Japanese name?

520
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,317
Her name on the official family register.

521
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,196
She hasn't mentioned it.

522
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,577
I see.

523
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,752
Those scars on your face…

524
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,715
Umedo had similar scars.

525
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,093
"Umedo"? Is that a friend of yours?

526
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,471
But

527
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,017
the savage ferocity within you…

528
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,772
makes you more like Kuwajiro.

529
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,704
Well, I better get going.

530
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:19,998
Asirpa.

531
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,751
Take care, okay?

532
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,221
What a weird old man.

533
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,140
Right? He must be senile or something.

534
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,687
MAKE A COPY

535
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,357
Asirpa, you'll catch a cold
if you sleep here.

536
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,483
Shut up.

537
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,264
-I was with the Seventh Division.
-Who else is a traitor?!

538
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,516
Only Wilk would do something like this.

539
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,892
Let's go Tanigaki hunting.
