("Next Baseball")

2
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,870
You're home.

3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,240
Yes.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you for today.

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,810
Well...

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,990
(When Seo-yeon came back
from kindergarten today...)

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,320
(Daram Kindergarten)

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,020
- Hello.
- Bye, Seo-yeon.

9
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,520
- Bye.
- Take photos of her now. Hurry.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,670
(Seo-yeon was quite shocked.)

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,740
(I comforted her,
and she got over it today.)

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,340
(But I'm worried that reporters
will continue)

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,110
(to come and see her.)

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,920
(Hey, are the articles true?
I feel really betrayed by you.)

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,890
(I'm Producer Kim Jong-min
from "Finding Love".)

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,990
(I contacted you
because I want to interview you.)

17
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,030
(Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung)
(Mr. Ye, are you okay?)

18
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,800
(I was just worried.)

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,170
(I'm worried about you and your daughter.)

20
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,470
(Be strong.)

21
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,909
Hong Dae-young.
How can my own friend say that to me?

22
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,150
Hong Dae-young?

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,660
I should have been the one
who got younger, not you.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,460
Why do you only get lucky like that?

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,830
Do you think this is good for me?

26
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,800
I can't even tell Da-jung who I am.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,130
All I can do is hover around her.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,970
Hong Dae-young.
Can you drink with me tonight?

29
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,540
Woo-young,

30
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,540
you're Hong Dae-young?

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,450
Have I truly gone mad now?

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,950
Ae-rin, that's not it.

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,690
"Ae-rin"?

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,130
Well, that's not it, Ms. Chu.

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,900
I didn't know you two were here.

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,870
I'm sorry, Ae-rin. I have to get going.
I have somewhere to be.

37
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,040
What? Hold on.

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,980
It sounds like it's urgent.
You should go, Da-jung.

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,240
Yes. You should hurry.

40
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,580
I mean, bye.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,450
Okay. See you again.

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,550
Okay.

43
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,920
Wait, Da-jung.

44
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,560
Yes?

45
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:02,830
I have

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
something to tell you.

47
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,040
Something to tell me? What is it?

48
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,510
So...

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,310
He...

50
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,610
He...

51
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,120
He...

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,780
Ae-rin. I'm sorry. I really need to go.

53
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,020
Let's talk on the phone later. Bye.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,560
Wait. I...

55
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,530
Gosh.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
What is it?

57
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,630
Why do you look so relieved?

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,640
Are you really Hong Dae-young?

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,070
Does that even make sense?

60
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,440
No, it doesn't.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,450
How could you make such
a ridiculous mistake?

62
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,750
You just called him Hong Dae-young.

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,650
I was talking to him
through the speakerphone.

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,520
You weren't on the speakerphone.

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,790
- Do you want to continue insisting on it?
- Dad!

66
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,190
Restrain yourself.

67
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,160
It's understandable to be mistaken.

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,590
How can I tolerate this?

69
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,960
Chu Ae-rin. This is insulting.

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,570
Really?

71
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,670
Then let's check.

72
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,800
What is she doing?

73
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,410
(Chu Ae-rin)

74
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,820
Why is Hong Dae-young's phone here?

75
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,960
Darn it.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,360
I told you to get another phone!

77
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,660
Why are you bringing that up now?

78
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,600
Be honest with me right now!

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,330
If you confuse me,
I'm going to call Da-jung and check.

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,470
No.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,340
So...

82
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,570
I...

83
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,140
I am Hong Dae-young, but...

84
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,910
You are?

85
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,950
You're really Hong Dae-young?

86
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,020
But please don't tell Da-jung.

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,120
I have my reasons.

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,330
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back for a second.

89
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,130
Let's eat together sometime.

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,700
Let's eat together sometime.

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,870
Deok-jin. Why don't we become in-laws?

92
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:34,180
Reasons, my foot.

93
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,180
Just you wait. I'm going to

94
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,020
find an appropriate punishment
for your lies.

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,650
- Hold on.
- Live your life honestly!

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,820
Ae-rin!

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,690
Chu Ae-rin.

98
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,390
Darn it.

99
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,270
I'm sorry for leaving like that
the other day.

100
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,340
There's no need to be.

101
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,440
Right. What about your daughter?
Where was she?

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,080
She was at the police station.

103
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,850
She left to look for her mom and got lost.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,520
You must've been surprised.

105
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,150
I was.

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,490
In any case,
she's the most difficult girl in my life.

107
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,430
How long have you been raising
your daughter alone?

108
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,130
It hasn't been long.

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,470
Then did her mom raise her before?

110
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,870
No.

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,970
Her dad.

112
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,110
What are you saying?

113
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,309
Aren't you her dad?

114
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,220
I'm her adopted dad.

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,090
I was talking about her biological mom,

116
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,960
my older brother.

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,000
(My brother was an incredible person.)

118
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,700
(He would deliver newspapers at dawn,)

119
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,640
(- tutor 2 to 3 kids during the day,)
- If you apply this...

120
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,110
(and work at a restaurant at night.)

121
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,950
(He did that all throughout college.)

122
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,820
Ji-hoon. What are you doing here?

123
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,860
I was scared to be alone.

124
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,460
I'm not done with work.

125
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,460
Ji-hoon. Can you

126
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,670
wait for me while you eat this?

127
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,870
Yes, I can.

128
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,140
- Ji-hoon. Hold on.
- Okay.

129
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,280
I got a page.

130
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,800
- Should we go home like this?
- Yes, I'd love to!

131
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
- Okay!
- Wow!

132
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,940
- Is it fun?
- Yes, it is. Yes!

133
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,480
(- Our parents passed away when he was 20.)
- There's one over there too.

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
You're right.

135
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm sure he was overwhelmed with
his own tuition and living expenses,

136
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,220
but he had to raise me too.

137
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,590
He went through a lot.

138
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,750
To me, he was my brother

139
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,690
as well as my parents.

140
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,300
(Enough already.)

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,430
So when is Ji-hoon going to become
a pro baseball player?

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Will he even become one?

143
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,340
Why would you say that?

144
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like you're hoping
he doesn't become one.

145
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,270
Am I saying this for no reason?

146
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,840
You keep pushing off our wedding
to take care of him.

147
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Why does your brother always come first?
Shouldn't that person be me?

148
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,320
I can't endure this anymore.

149
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,720
Let's break up.

150
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,250
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

151
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Darn it.

152
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,360
(I felt bad.)

153
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,740
(He broke up with his long-term girlfriend
like that because of me.)

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,870
(I thought it was all over, but...)

155
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,740
(I still remember it clearly.)

156
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,380
(It was the day I got selected
in the first draft.)

157
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,550
(It was the day I got selected
in the first draft.)

158
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,450
(Seum Wolves)

159
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,150
Hey!

160
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,950
- Hey, I...
- Welcome home.

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,260
Who's this baby?

162
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,860
Isn't she pretty? She's my daughter.

163
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,290
She's your daughter?

164
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,330
Is Mi-a her mom?

165
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,200
I decided to raise her.

166
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,200
My gosh!

167
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,840
Hey, the baby will be surprised.

168
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,610
It's okay.

169
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,080
Didn't you have something to tell me?

170
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,580
I got it.

171
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,880
I made the rookie draft.

172
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,280
Really?

173
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,020
Oh, my.

174
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,930
Really? Good job.

175
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,230
Good job, Ji-hoon. Seriously.

176
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,400
Well done.

177
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,060
(- My brother was always like that.)
- Congratulations.

178
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,100
Goodness. It's okay.

179
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,840
(What happened to me came first)

180
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,570
(to whatever problem
he had in front of him.)

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,670
(If something good happened to me,)

182
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,070
(he was happier than I was.)

183
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,210
Are you training?

184
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,750
Your phone is off.

185
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,520
Ji-hoon.
Eat well while you're in the States

186
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,850
and don't overstrain yourself.

187
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,720
Have a Merry Christmas!

188
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,210
(I thought, "Is this what it feels like
to suddenly be orphaned?")

189
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,410
(I was only thinking of myself,)

190
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,610
(but then, I saw Seo-yeon.)

191
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,920
Seo-yeon.

192
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,460
(That's when I decided)

193
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,060
(that just like how my brother
became my parent,)

194
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,600
(I will become her father.)

195
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,280
That's amazing, Ji-hoon.

196
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,950
It's nothing.

197
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,420
As much as I had wanted to be,

198
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,560
I haven't done much for her as her father.

199
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,460
And with the public finding out
through the news,

200
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
I'm only breaking her heart even more.

201
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
I'm thinking

202
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,940
of retiring.

203
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,010
Retiring?

204
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,110
If I don't explain myself clearly,
people will only make more assumptions.

205
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,650
Before Seo-yeon gets
old enough to understand,

206
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,490
I should retire.
I think that's only right.

207
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,490
Are you sure you won't regret it?

208
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,490
Regret it?

209
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,830
I might at times.

210
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,930
Then don't retire.

211
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,570
Can you imagine how Seo-yeon will feel

212
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
when she becomes older and realizes

213
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,410
that you gave up on your career
because of her?

214
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,480
As grateful as she would feel,

215
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,550
she will also feel terribly guilty.

216
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,220
It'll also feel pressuring
because she'll feel like

217
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,390
she's a burden to you.

218
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,000
Happy parents raise happy children.

219
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
If you feel like
you're going to regret it,

220
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,170
don't stop. Keep going.

221
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,210
Both for Seo-yeon and yourself.

222
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,110
Thank you for telling me that.

223
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,950
It's nothing. I'm just offering help

224
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,620
as your fan.

225
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,160
I thought you said
that you weren't my fan.

226
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,890
I'm your fan from now on.

227
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,260
Seo-yeon's dad, Ye Ji-hoon,

228
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,330
is absolutely amazing.

229
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,070
So, no matter what people will say,

230
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,130
I will forever be your fan.

231
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,240
Don't let people who don't know you

232
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,810
get to you.

233
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,610
To me, Ji-hoon,
you're the greatest baseball player,

234
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,120
and no matter what happens,
I will forever be your fan.

235
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,660
(So, no matter what people will say,)

236
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,890
I will forever be your fan.

237
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay? So feel better.

238
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,800
You two look alike.

239
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,330
My brother and you.

240
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,220
=Episode 7:
Someone Who Gives Courage to Me=

241
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,900
Things are looking good today.

243
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,970
- Boss!
- Hey!

244
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,600
I told you not to call me that.

245
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,810
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,610
How many times do I have to tell you?

247
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,540
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,010
Let's see how much we've made tonight.

249
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,480
Choi Il-kwon?

250
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,290
You own this place?

251
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,520
You work really hard.

252
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,890
You're a teacher, and you own a bar?

253
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,930
Hey. Stop the nonsense.

254
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,800
Are you drunk?

255
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,230
Of course I am!

256
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,000
Hong Dae-young messed me up.

257
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,640
I don't know what it is,

258
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,710
but I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose.

259
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,850
He definitely did this on purpose!

260
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,750
I bet you were fooled too.

261
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Me?

262
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,390
I haven't seen Dae-young in years.

263
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,120
You saw him. Go Woo-young.

264
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,930
What about Woo-young?

265
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,560
You idiot.

266
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,660
Go Woo-young is Hong Dae-young.

267
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,300
Hong Dae-young is Go Woo-young!

268
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,110
What's wrong with her?

269
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Chu Ae-rin.

270
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:52,560
I don't really know how I'm supposed
to play with Seo-yeon.

271
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,259
Just talking like this is good too.

272
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,960
- Is that right?
- But the key is

273
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,830
to do something active.

274
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,030
How?

275
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,040
For example, you could tell her

276
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,769
that her wish will come true
if she can catch a petal in the air.

277
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,340
Just that, and she'll be running around.

278
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,240
She'll probably spend

279
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,510
half an hour at least, catching a petal.

280
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,150
I don't think it'll take that long.

281
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,750
Give it a try. It's harder than you think.

282
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,760
- What?
- What?

283
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,290
See? I caught one in one try.

284
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,130
What's your wish?

285
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,800
My wish is...

286
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,570
Well,

287
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,670
it's a secret.

288
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,610
That's no fun.

289
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,940
Isn't that Ye Ji-hoon? No way!

290
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,310
- Right?
- Who's that woman with him?

291
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,910
Is he seeing someone?

292
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
No way.

293
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,350
Hold on.

294
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
They must be dating.

295
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,910
Are they gone?

296
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Not yet.

297
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,880
(Hong Dae-young)

298
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,750
Ae-rin.

299
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,790
Why are you here?

300
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,760
To ask you

301
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,500
not to tell Da-jung.

302
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,470
Why should I not?

303
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,970
I'm her friend, not yours!

304
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,040
I'm asking you to do it for her.

305
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,740
For her?

306
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,780
How is any of this for Da-jung?

307
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,150
I can help her when she needs it.

308
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,320
After getting divorced and all?

309
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,490
You should've done better before.

310
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,630
I should have,

311
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,300
but I finally realized.

312
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,200
I said that I was busy all the time
so that I can come home late,

313
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,110
and was always drunk at home,
with the excuse being that I'm tired.

314
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,840
I missed it all.

315
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,380
The times my family really needed me.

316
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm trying to be good now.

317
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,680
I stopped drinking too.

318
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,250
But

319
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,220
if she finds out that I'm Hong Dae-young,

320
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,320
Da-jung will

321
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,430
certainly feel uncomfortable.

322
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,860
So, please, Ae-rin.

323
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,800
Please don't tell her.

324
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,870
All right. I'll think about it.

325
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,440
Thank you for understanding, Ae-rin.

326
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm still thinking about it,
so don't thank me just yet.

327
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,700
Please keep it a secret.

328
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,470
He's trying his best.

329
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,570
Trying his best? As if.

330
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,940
Don't you know
Si-woo started playing basketball?

331
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,010
I don't.

332
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,080
Why are you bringing that up
all of a sudden now?

333
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,050
Si-woo is great at basketball,
but he's just not confident,

334
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,350
so he acted as if he wasn't interested
in basketball to Dae-young.

335
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,120
But when he approached Si-woo
as his friend, Go Woo-young,

336
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,460
they've been practicing together
and decided to go for the tryout.

337
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,460
This shows how much he's trying.

338
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,360
Can't you understand

339
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,700
why Dae-young keeps lying?

340
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,900
So can you just help him out too? Please?

341
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,370
Please?

342
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,070
Please.

343
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,740
Gosh, fine. Get off the elevator now.

344
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,540
That's a promise.

345
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,040
(Doors are closing.)

346
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,330
I had them with me.

347
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,840
Darn it!

348
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,150
I should be the only one
to go through such humiliation.

349
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,860
(Document for approval)

350
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,860
Hey, Ae-rin.

351
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,000
Da-jung, I'll meet you
in front of your house tonight.

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,090
There's something you must know.
Da-jung, I'll meet you
in front of your house tonight.

353
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,060
There's something you must know.

354
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,640
Okay. See you later.

355
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,480
Close the gate. Close it!

356
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,550
- Come here.
- No!

357
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,220
- No!
- Come on, sir.

358
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,250
- Can you let this slide just once?
- Please! Just this once.

359
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,190
- Please.
- Can you please let me go this once?

360
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,790
- Please, sir.
- Come on.

361
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,890
Hey, be quiet.
Tell me your classroom number.

362
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,360
- Just this once! Please.
- Can you please let me get in?

363
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,860
- No.
- Please.

364
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,160
- You can run the laps in the field.
- No. Please.

365
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,670
- Please, sir.
- Come on.

366
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,840
Finish your laps quickly
and get back in class!

367
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,010
- Why are you always late to school?
- Darn it.

368
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm out of breath. Don't talk to me.

369
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,180
Yes, I can see that.
Do you want me to carry your bag?

370
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,720
Gosh, forget it.

371
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,850
Give me that.

372
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,360
What? You weren't late to school.

373
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,730
I'm volunteering.

374
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,430
You've been on time lately, but not today.

375
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,760
Darn it. Stop teasing me.

376
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,860
I won't.

377
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,570
What are you doing? Focus on your running!

378
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,670
Darn it.

379
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,500
If you're volunteering, carry mine too.

380
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,910
Gosh.

381
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,310
Hey.

382
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,780
Come on. Hey!

383
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,290
Gosh, that jerk.

384
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,290
Who wants to go to the snack bar?

385
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,930
- Me.
- I want to go.

386
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,090
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

387
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,430
Let's go.

388
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,540
Aren't you a hard-working volunteer?

389
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,310
Yes. Why don't you let that go?

390
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,380
Let me have this one.

391
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,350
Let you have this one?

392
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,830
What are you doing? It's my pencil case.

393
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,870
Gosh.

394

(Serim High School)

395
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,420
What are they watching?

396
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,430
Bo-bae, what are you watching?

397
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,100
Hey. Oh, this?

398
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,100
It looks like Si-woo and Woo-young
are trying out for the basketball team.

399
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,600
Si-woo?

400
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,470
(Go, Serim High. You can do it!)
Yes. I can see you guys have good basics.

401
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,980
The last part of your test will be a 1-on-1 play.

402
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,440
Woo-young, you're up first.

403
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,850
(Let's go, Serim High Basketball Team!)

Go Woo-young!

410
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,910
- He's so cool, isn't he?
- Yes.

411
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,160
Okay. Si-woo, it's your turn.

412
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,650
That was cool.

413
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,900
Well, yes. I will talk to your parents

414
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,700
this week.
And if there aren't any problems,

415
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,370
you'll join the team.

416
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,970
Guys, gather up in the center.

417
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,610
- Well done.
- I was so nervous.

418
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,110
You were great, Si-woo.

419
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,250
(Wisely, Beautifully, and Diligently)

420
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,650
Does the coach have to talk to my parents?

421
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,020
Why is there a problem with that?

422
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,120
No.

423
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,020
The kids will recognize my mom.

424
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,260
And she might hear all those nasty things
they say when she comes to school.

425
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,090
And my dad is in Busan.

426
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,900
Oh, right. Should I ask
my grandpa to come?

427
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,510
- Your grandpa?
- Yes.

428
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,470
Come with me.

429
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,350
All right. Come on in.

430
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,490
All right.

431
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,760
You wait here.
Let me bring you some juice.

432
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,490
- I can do that, Grandpa.
- Sure.

433
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,260
Gosh.

434
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,530
You know, things can get a bit messy
when an old man lives by himself.

435
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,800
Give me a second.

436
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,240
- Here. Have some juice.
- Thank you.

437
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,110
So you also decided to
play basketball in the end

438
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,610
just like your father.

439
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,850
If your grandmother heard the news,

440
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,080
she would have been the happiest for you.

441
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,830
Your father was
an amazing basketball player.

442
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,230
That was the only thing
we could brag about him.

443
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,130
But other than basketball,
he didn't excel at anything.

444
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,400
And he never listened to us.

445
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,770
He was quite the troublemaker.

446
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,680
Si-woo, you can't take after him
in that way, okay?

447
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Okay.

448
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,450
Grandpa.

449
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,220
Can you come for
a parent-teacher conference?

450
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,790
It's necessary if I want to join
the basketball team.

451
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,930
Parent-teacher conference?

452
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,630
If an old man goes,

453
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,730
he wouldn't even understand
what they're saying.

454
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,870
I'm sure it's completely different from
when your dad played.

455
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,140
They called the parents to ask them
for money.

456
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,340
They asked you for money?

457
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,970
Did you ever give the coach money?

458
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,380
No. I never gave him any.

459
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,580
I knew that my son would do good
with his skills.

460
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,380
Parents need to trust their kids

461
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,120
and be confident so that
their kids can be confident too.

462
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,960
But why aren't you telling your mom and
dad about the parent-teacher conference?

463
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,260
Oh, it's because I thought my mom
would be busy,

464
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
and my dad is in Busan on business.

465
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,730
Busan?

466
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,670
He doesn't even know anyone there.

467
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,840
Si-woo,
you should ask your mom and dad first.

468
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,310
If they both can't make it,

469
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,050
I'll go in their place then.

470
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,710
Really?

471
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,820
Thank you, Grandpa.

472
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,160
Right. Goodness, you punk.

473
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,620
Thank you.

474
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,030
Si-woo.

475
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,630
Yes?

476
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,470
You should tell your mom

477
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,810
that you're playing basketball.

478
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,640
If she finds out you didn't tell her
because you were worried about her,

479
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,510
she'll be hurt.

480
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,750
That's how parents are.

481
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,580
They don't want to worry their children.

482
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,450
You're right.

483
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Okay.

484
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,760
- Let's go.
- Okay.

485
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,160
Oh, Mom.

486
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,630
Hello, Aunt Ae-rin.

487
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Hi.

488
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,050
I heard everything.

489
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,590
You...

490
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,700
Hold on.

491
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
I would like to

492
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,210
discuss that later by ourselves.

493
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,140
Even if you heard it all,

494
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,830
you should listen to what I have to say...

495
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,910
Why?

496
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,040
So... Even if you get angry,

497
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,720
you should hear me out first...

498
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,980
What are you talking about?

499
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,080
Should I be mad that you play basketball
with Si-woo?

500
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,190
Pardon?

501
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,130
Now that I think about it,

502
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,360
I'm a bit hurt.

503
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,400
Si-woo. Must I hear that you're playing
basketball from Aunt Ae-rin?

504
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,270
I'm sorry, Mom.

505
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,810
Are you coming back
from playing basketball?

506
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,710
Mom, I passed the try-outs
for the basketball team.

507
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,710
Oh, my. Really?

508
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Yes.

509
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,050
That's incredible. I'm so proud of you!

510
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,650
What do you want to eat?

511
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,020
I want kimchi fried rice.

512
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,060
Really?

513
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,390
I'll make it for you.

514
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
Okay.

515
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,130
My son is amazing.

516
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,840
Did you think I told her everything?

517
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,280
I just felt guilty.

518
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,110
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

519
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,150
It's okay.

520
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,280
It's true that I went to tell her.

521
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,350
What?

522
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,720
But

523
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,190
I couldn't tell her.

524
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,570
What do you think about Go Woo-young?

525
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,000
Woo-young?

526
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,370
Why are you asking about Deok-jin's son?

527
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,540
Answer me. What do you think about him?

528
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,020
Maybe it's because he lived abroad
for a long time,

529
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,690
he's a bit rude.

530
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,560
But overall, I think he's a nice kid.

531
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,560
What? Are you...

532
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,700
You should stop.

533
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,270
(He shows up when I'm in danger
and helps me.)

534
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,470
Be strong.

535
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
What?

536
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,470
It was hard to achieve your dream.

537
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,240
so you shouldn't get hindered by
things like this.

538
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,210
Don't worry about Si-a and Si-woo,

539
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,850
and focus on your work.

540
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,750
I'll take care of the kids at school.

541
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,920
(And he comforts me when I'm troubled.)

542
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,490
(This is a letter that Mr. Hong
asked me to give her.)

543
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,760
(He even gave me the letter
that Dae-young wrote.)

544
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,330
Hong Si-a. Hong Si-a!

545
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,630
I'm going to call 911.

546
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,830
What do you think you're doing?

547
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,030
It's faster to run to the hospital
right by the school!

548
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,400
(Woo-young was the one)

549
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,400
(who brought Si-a to the emergency room)

550
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,070
when she was sick.

551
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,640
He was there when you needed someone.

552
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,150
What?

553
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,420
Woo-young.

554
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,580
He was there when you needed someone.

555
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,290
You're right. Now that I said it,

556
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,790
I'm very grateful to him.

557
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
You're right.

558
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,900
But you're acting weird.

559
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,970
Why did you ask about Woo-young
all of a sudden?

560
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,700
It's because...

561
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,440
Hey. No way.

562
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,010
Was that story about minor about you?

563
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,180
Hey!

564
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,010
What do you take me for?

565
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,080
I heard that Woo-young

566
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,750
is playing basketball with Si-woo.

567
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,020
- Really?
- I knew it.

568
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,520
I knew you didn't know.

569
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,720
I heard the two of them
are busy preparing for

570
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,460
the basketball team try-outs.

571
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,660
I called you here because I thought that
I should tell you this.

572
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,830
What's more important to you
than your children?

573
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,570
I thought that

574
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,040
you might be right, and it would be better
if she didn't know the truth.

575
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,250
But let's make one thing clear.

576
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,480
Do you want to get back together
with Da-jung?

577
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,650
Gosh. How can I do that?

578
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,950
I'm going to school with our kids
right now.

579
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,290
I guess you still love her.

580
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,430
No.

581
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
I just

582
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,240
want to do everything

583
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,170
I couldn't do for her now.

584
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
Let's go.

585
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,660
How did you get younger?

586
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,090
Let me know your secret.

587
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,890
I don't know how this happened.

588
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,830
You don't know? Gosh!

589
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,330
I want to get younger too.
That's disappointing.

590
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,270
You look exactly like you did back then.

591
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,740
You're just saying that to be nice.

592
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,210
No. If you put on a school uniform, you'd
look like you did in high school.

593
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,440
Gosh. You know how to
have a good social life.

594
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,880
It's true.

595
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,350
Forget it. Goodness.

596
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,790
(Lee Chul-young, Chu Ae-rin,
Choi Min-jung)

597
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,390
(Chu Ae-rin)

598
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,000
She looks just like she did back then.

599
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,100
(Class 3-5)

600
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,640
(Hong Dae-young)

601
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,780
(Go Woo-young is Hong Dae-young.)

602
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,910
(Hong Dae-young is)

603
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,280
(Go Woo-young!)

604
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,890
(Hong Dae-young)

605
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,700
Da-jung! Come in.

606
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,450
Why are you just standing there? Come in.

607
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,030
- Hey.
- Hey.

608
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,430
I'm sorry I took so long.

609
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,700
What are you doing? Have a seat.

610
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,610
These three are
college varsity team coaches.

611
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,620
Hello.

612
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,850
Why are you being so awkward?

613
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,660
This is all for Si-woo.

614
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,560
I don't introduce them to other parents
even when they plead.

615
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,730
You're getting
some real special treatment.

616
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,770
Sure.

617
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I told you.

618
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,200
She's Hong Si-woo's mother,
the kid who just joined this term.

619
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,270
She's Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

620
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,470
You all know her from the news, right?

621
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,940
The water bomb.

622
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,410
Yes, the water bomb! I saw that!

623
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,080
I watched it multiple times.

624
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,950
Her body is quite amazing.

625
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,750
I really enjoyed watching that.

626
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Sure.

627
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,490
You really had children with that body?

628
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,560
Your waist tells me otherwise.

629
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,660
Right?

630
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,370
Why don't we all toast to start the night?

631
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,270
I've never had an anchorwoman pour me
a drink before.

632
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,170
Please pour me a nice glass.

633
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,440
I'm sorry,

634
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,580
but I'm here as Si-woo's mother.

635
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,250
I'm not here to pour anyone drinks.

636
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,650
Please do not cross the line.

637
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,620
- Not cross the line?
- I didn't know,

638
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,390
but she's quite tactless.

639
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,360
Whatever. Don't even bother.

640
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,330
Il-kwon, we'll give you two some space.

641
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,870
Have a great parent-teacher conference.

642
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,100
Let's go.

643
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,100
Coach Jung, come on.

644
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,240
Let's just enjoy the night.

645
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,640
Da-jung, apologize to them already.

646
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,610
I'm sorry.

647
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,920
I'll get going first.

648
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,650
Next time, why don't we meet
somewhere else?

649
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,860
Wait.

650
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,860
Da-jung!

651
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,590
Hold on.

652
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,700
I'm going to report you to the police
right now.

653
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,310
You really don't know much
about sports, do you?

654
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,210
It was like this when I was a player.
It was even worse.

655
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,950
It will all come back to your son
if you keep acting like this.

656
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,350
Okay.

657
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,320
I'll wrap it up here tonight.

658
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
Here.

659
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,430
Send me the money to that account.

660
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,990
Why should I?

661
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,060
Come on! Don't be so stiff!

662
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,000
You have to pay if you want Si-woo
to play games.

663
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,700
Choi Il-kwon! Is this how you've been
coaching kids?

664
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,670
It's not just me.

665
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
It's not like I'm desperate.

666
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,510
This night was organized for Si-woo,
but you ruined it.

667
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,110
And if you don't send the money,

668
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,850
you're putting an end
to his basketball career.

669
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Da-jung, isn't it a priority
to have Si-woo succeed?

670
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,450
Are you really going to let more money

671
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,190
get in the way of Si-woo's dream?

672
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,590
You're his mother.

673
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,770
(Hong Dae-young)

674
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,680
I'm helping you for the last time,
Dae-young.

675
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,390
Why would Il-kwon hold
a parent-teacher meeting here?

676
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,260
Hey!

677
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,430
Stop the music.

678
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,370
I need to talk to him, girls.
Step out for a moment.

679
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,440
Come on.

680
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,770
You're so late.
Do you know what time it is?

681
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,210
Aren't you dating Ms. Ok?

682
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,880
I am.

683
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,720
I think it's been about a month.

684
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,050
And you're here, with women?

685
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,420
This is just me doing my business.

686
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,190
Why can't you separate
business from personal life?

687
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,630
Are you going to be like this
when you get married?

688
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,360
Are you insane?

689
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,600
Why would I get married?

690
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,630
People become nothing when they have kids.

691
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,500
I've seen enough parents to testify.

692
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,770
"Coach, please let my son play"

693
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,980
"the next game."

694
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,750
"Coach, please help my son get
into a university."

695
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,750
Seriously.

696
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,220
I'm not going to live like that.

697
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,450
I'm not letting everyone step over me
just because of a kid.

698
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,750
Goodness.

699
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,360
Here.

700
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,490
(Receipt, Total: 1,512,000 won)
Here.

701
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,740
What are you doing? You should pay.

702
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,240
I did. I paid 2,000 won for my Coke.

703
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,840
Seriously?

704
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,180
Forget it.

705
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:58,750
Whatever.

706
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,720
Just send money to these people.

707
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,760
- Why should I...
- You have to,

708
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,520
so that your son can play a game.

709
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,130
Understood?

710
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,900
I understand.

711
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,870
I'm not sending any money.

712
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,470
Are you not going to have your son play
basketball?

713
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,140
How can you call yourself a parent?

714
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,170
I've never thought of him as my kid.

715
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,540
You're a lunatic.

716
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,180
If Go Woo-young can't play basketball,

717
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,520
it's all your fault.

718
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,490
That's his life.
Why should that be my fault?

719
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,520
Did he eat something wrong?
What's his problem?

720
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,230
How was the meeting?

721
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,200
I told you that he hasn't changed!

722
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,070
What's wrong?

723
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,070
Did he beat you up?

724
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,610
Yes, I did. My mind sure did.

725
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,980
Choi Il-kwon called me to a bar
to have a "parent-teacher meeting",

726
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,780
and he was drinking with women!

727
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,910
What?

728
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,080
Not only that, he gave me the bill to pay

729
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,020
and told me to send money to some people.

730
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,350
He's like that.

731
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,460
Ms. Ok is completely fooled!

732
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,260
Goodness.

733
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,830
I thought he really cleaned his acts up
when he became a teacher.

734
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,330
He did.

735
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,900
He cleaned himself up so well,

736
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,970
he handwrote the account information.

737
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,840
Then what about Da-jung?

738
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,540
She met with him before me.

739
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,680
Choi Il-kwon, that piece of trash!

740
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,570
(Dad)

741
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,450
(Hey, Si-woo. Were you asleep?)

742
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,880
No, what's up?

743
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,220
I just talked to Mr. Go on the phone,

744
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,850
and he said that he had a meeting
with the basketball coach.

745
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,860
I was wondering
how your mom's meeting went.

746
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,530
I don't know. She's not home yet.

747
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Is that right?

748
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,840
Woo-young!

749
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,240
What are you doing here?

750
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:16,810
This is

751
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,310
my hiding place.

752
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,680
What about you?

753
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,050
To see Si-woo, of course.

754
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,430
This is a great hiding spot.
The view is amazing.

755
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,630
In particular,

756
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,330
this seems to be the spot.

757
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,570
This is the third time.

758
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,310
What do you mean?

759
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,480
You seeing me drunk.

760
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,480
I'm sorry.

761
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,050
It's okay.

762
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:54,320
Oh, right.

763
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,520
Did you quit drinking?

764
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,750
I quit right away after listening to you.

765
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,220
You're such a nice kid.

766
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,120
You're nice and annoying...

767
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,500
It's okay.

768
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,870
I don't think so.

769
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,640
It's really fine

770
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,640
as long as you're okay.

771
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,810
What?

772
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,950
I know today was tough.

773
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,190
But it's all right.

774
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,890
You did well today.

775
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,760
I didn't drink because I had a hard day.

776
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,470
Stop lying. It shows.

777
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,000
You're a mindreader.

778
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,100
I bet you even know what my trouble is.

779
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,610
I don't know,

780
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,340
but whatever you decide,

781
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,210
I hope you can stand by that decision.

782
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,820
That's what my parents did.

783
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,190
A decision I can stand by.

784
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,990
It's interesting

785
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,460
how you're always with me

786
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,730
whenever I need someone.

787
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,270
Aren't you grateful?

788
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,040
You're taking credit
even at times like this.

789
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,010
Yes.

790
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Thank you.

791
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,310
I'm passing on my energy.

792
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,210
You're passing on your energy.

793
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,220
I hope it wasn't too much.

794
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,190
I gave you just the right amount.

795
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,450
I don't think so.

796
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,420
I'm full of energy right now.

797
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,960
I think I can do a good job.

798
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,750
(Choi Il-kwon)

799
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,420
A decision I can stand by.

800
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,730
Hey, Il-kwon.

801
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,430
I would like to meet today and talk.

802
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,870
Sure. I'm glad
you made the right decision.

803
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,770
Okay.

804
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,170
Let's meet at the school tonight.

805
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,520
Hey, Hong Dae-young.

806
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,810
Oh, right. That's not you.

807
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,880
You're Go Woo-young.

808
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,790
Lately, I've been confused

809
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,230
if you're Hong Dae-young or Go Woo-young.

810
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,100
Did your father
come back home safely last night?

811
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,170
Yes.

812
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,440
He did?

813
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,170
I see.

814
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,870
(Chu Ae-rin)

815
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,570
Record? Why would you want to do that?

816
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,870
(Serim High School)

817
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,670
I was wondering if the recording file

818
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,540
can be used as evidence
when reporting an illegal college broker.

819
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,750
As long as you're part of
the conversation, you don't have to

820
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,250
inform him. It'll still be admissible.

821
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,050
But why are you asking
about an illegal college broker?

822
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,650
Il-kwon asked me for money
