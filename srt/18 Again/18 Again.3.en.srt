Are you okay?

I... Yes.

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,460

Hello. My name is Jung Da-jung.

00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,020
Nice to meet you.

(Jung Da-jung)

13
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,690
Go take the empty seat over there.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay.

15
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:24,360
Hey, you.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,400
Hi.

17
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,670
Right.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,170
Hi.

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,110
I'm glad we came to see her.

20
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,980
(Broadcasting System Room)
I'm glad we came to see her.

21
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,779
- Look at her.
- She's so pretty.

22
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,020
She's smiling.

23
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,720
She's really pretty.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,490
- My heart is going to stop.
- I know.

25
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,690
(At a time when I didn't know what love was,)

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,770
She's waving at me.

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,470
(I had feelings that I didn't understand.)

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,340
(And I did things that I didn't understand.)

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,420
It's raining.

30
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,490
I don't have an umbrella.

31
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,790
Da-jung. Let's share an umbrella.

32
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,290
My umbrella is really big.

33
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,390
- Share with me.
- Come with me.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,800
- Let's share mine.
- Come with me.

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,000
It's raining. You don't want to
catch a cold. Let's go.

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,900
Let's go. Hurry.

37
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,670
Come with me.

38
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,740
Let's go together.

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,340

00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,520
Come with me.

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay. I would like that.

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,270
Da-jung.

48
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,680
What are you doing here in the morning?

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,819
What a colossal mess!

50
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,030
I have no idea what you're thinking.

51
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,060
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back for a second.

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,700
You.

53
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,370
Hong Dae-young.

54
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,020
Da-jung. The thing is...

55
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,150
Hong Dae-young!

56
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,420
You're his son, aren't you?

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,959
Son? What are you talking about?

58
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,260
I know that you're his son!

59
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,900
Go Deok-jin.

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,470
Covering for him just because
he's your friend isn't true friendship.

61
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,300
If you're really thinking of Dae-young,
be honest me with me.

62
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,340
How can you have a kid
without getting married?

63
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,540
You said you were single.

64
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,710
I'm single, but he's my son.

65
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,450
You guys are suspicious.

66
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,050
Is that so?

67
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,460
Then what about this?

68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,290
How will you explain this?

69
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,040
Woo-young looks like his mother.

70
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,900
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,240
His mom looks like Hong Dae-young.

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,910
You dated a woman that looks like
your friend?

73
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,250
What kind of ridiculous excuse is that?

74
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,120
All sorts of things can happen in life.

75
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,920
Really?

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,320
Then let's give him a call.

77
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,420
Let's call Hong Dae-young

78
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,330
and have a three- party talk.

79
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,890
(Hong Dae-young)

80
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,040
Woo-young, go to school.
You're going to be late.

81
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,870
Right. I'm going to school.

82
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,420
Hey, Dae-young. It's me, Deok-jin.

83
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,560
Deok-jin?

84
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,260
Why are you calling me
with Da-jung's phone?

85
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,800
It seems she's mistaken about something.

86
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,970
Hong Dae-young.

87
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,030
Yes, Jung Da-jung.

88
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,970
Do you know Go Woo-young?

89
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,100
Go Woo-young?

90
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,209
Of course. He's Deok-jin's son.

91
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,709
He looks exactly like you.

92
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,880
Be honest with me.

93
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,320
He's your son, right?

94
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,750
What? Are you really asking me that?

95
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,750
(If that's not the case,)

96
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,720
how can Deok-jin's son

97
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,820
look like you?

98
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,990
That's because

99
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,000
Woo-young's mom looks like me.

100
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,040
Does that make sense?

101
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,110
Deok-jin used to follow me around
all throughout our school years,

102
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,110
and then he ended up meeting a woman
who looked like me.

103
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,450
He acts just like you too.

104
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,480
My gosh. Jung Da-jung.

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,350
Can't you believe me?

106
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,550
(Think about it.)

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,360
Go Deok-jin, that game maniac,
would rather raise game characters

108
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,990
(than my son.)

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,860
What?

110
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,959
You're right

111
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,360
about that.

112
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,370
Stop insisting on nonsense.

113
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,440
But still. He looks so much like him.

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,070
How does my son look anything like
this rude jerk?

115
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,420
How could she be mistaken about
something so ridiculous?

116
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,820
I was wrong about her smoking,

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,260
I'll forgive you just this once.

Let's go.

125
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,700
Again? She could've woken up
five minutes earlier.

126
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,830
My gosh.

127
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,000
She doesn't know how precious money is.

128
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,500
I told you to call me.

129
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,440
I was almost late today too.

130
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,510
- Isn't 14 tardies too many?
- Hi SG Boy.

131
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,210
(- SG Boy?)
- Gosh, again with that SG Boy.

132
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,550
(What does she mean by that?)

133
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,850
(I bet she's trying to tease me.)

134

(I should just stay still.)

135
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I really don't understand.

136
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,860
How come dads have money to drink,

137
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,690
but they don't have money to give
to their kids?

138
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,660
Whenever I ask my dad for some allowance,

139
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,870
he asks about my spending and my grades.

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,870
He begins nitpicking everything
like crazy.

141
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,570
(What? What does he do?)

142
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,510
Goodness.
How can you ask your dads for money?

- What is it?

- Dreams?

Dreams?

151
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,490
I had a dream about a fire.

152
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,990
Do you think it was a dream
about your promotion?

153
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,200
Did you get rid of the fire or not?

154
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,130
I didn't.

155
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,670
Then it's settled. Sell that dream to me.

156
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,170
Okay. Give me 50,000 won.

157

You kissed a pig!

158

Our ancestors rubbed their feces
on the wall.

159

00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,570
What's wrong with him?

166
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,770
- Is he talking to us?
- No, he's not.

167
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,070
How immature can you be?

168
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,080
Do you have fun conning your dad
and getting money from him?

169
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,010
What do you mean con him?

170
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,680
If our dads gave us more allowance,
we wouldn't be talking about this.

171
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,920
I saw you guys taking a taxi to school
every morning.

172
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,700
What?

173
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,860
Thank you.

174
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,370
Thank you.

175
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,500
Again?

176
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,110
But you blame your parents?

177
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,150
You would have plenty of allowances if you didn't take taxis.

178
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,420
That's 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month,
so that's 20 days.

179
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,450
Let's say the cab fare is 8,000 won from your home to school.

180
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,550
(20 times 8,000 won is 160,000 won.)

181
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,820
(160,000 won) 
That's 160,000 won!

182
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,020
You spend 160,000 won a month, but that's not enough?

183
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,630
You!

184
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,260
Have you ever thought about how your father feels?

185
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,630
Have you ever thought of your father as you paid for the cab?

186
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,140
Woo-young, it's a misunderstanding.

187
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You!

188
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,770
Your makeup is more natural now.

189
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,740
That's great.

190
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,080
Woo-young, you've misunderstood.

191
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,110
And you!

192
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,550
Stop calling me SG Boy.

193
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,850
I don't like it.

194
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,620
SG Boy is a compliment.

195
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,590
Superior Gene Boy.

196
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,390
(SG Boy: Superior Gene Boy)
Superior Gene Boy.

197
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,690
Does it bother you?

198
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,900
That's what that means?

199
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,900
My dad is a cab driver.

200
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
That's why he drives me to school
every day.

201
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,140
I see.

202
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,910
Your father is a cab driver?

203
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm just saying all of this
for your own good.

204
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,150
You know what I mean, right?

205
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,250
Nonsense.

206
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,650
"Nonsense"?

207
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,050
Hong Si-a, can you speak a little nicer?

208
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,660
It's fine to be like that to me,
but if you do that to everyone else,

209
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,360
people aren't going to like you.

210
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,390
Stop it. That's enough.

211
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,170
I can't stand a single minute with him.

212
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,240
Let's go.

213
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,300
What? What did I do wrong?

214
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,810
Si-a hates people who are like her dad.

215
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,940
You know, the really old- fashioned people.

216
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,510
"Really old- fashioned"?

217
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,710
Si-a's father is only 37,

218
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,180
so what do you mean, "old- fashioned"?

219
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,220
Age isn't what makes someone
old- fashioned.

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,520
Si-a's dad is notorious.

221
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,590
Don't worry, Woo-young.

222
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,290
You're not that bad yet.

223
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
We're going now.

224
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,460
Really old- fashioned?

225
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,060
(Really old- fashioned)

226
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,030
He ruined my morning.

227
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,270
But I think Woo-young has a point.

228
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,310
If you think about it, my dad drives me
to school

229
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,710
because I wake up late every morning.

230
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,840
Yet, I've been taking him for granted.

231
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,280
What are you saying?

232
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,250
I agree. When he asked,
"How would your father feel?",

233
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
it kind of touched my heart.

234
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,150
I agree.

235
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,090
Let's be good to our dads from now on.

236
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,160
Yes, I'm not going to ask him
for allowance anymore,

237
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,490
and I'll wake up early.

238
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,850
They really do look alike.

239
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,230
I feel bad. What if I just hurt the kid
for no reason?

240
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,900
I'm going to head home
after taking the trash out.

241
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,770
Sure. I'll take care of the rest.

242
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,720
I didn't bring an umbrella.

243
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
What a relief.

244
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
I'll pay for this.

245
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,780
What's this?

246
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
Take it.

247
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,280
I'm fine.

248
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,020
You're going to catch a cold if you don't.

249
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Goodness.

250
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,760
What was that? Why isn't he using
his umbrella?

251
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,910
(Hong Si-woo)

252
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Good.

253
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,919
(Hong Si-woo)

254
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,790
Did Si-a bring it for me?

255
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,899
I'm the best dad in the world.

256
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,950
- Min- gi!
- Dad!

257
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,250
It's raining. Hop in.

258
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,910
- Okay.
- You must be exhausted from studying.

259
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,380
Let's go.

260
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,970
I'm on my way, I'm telling you!

261
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,310
I'm right at the door, sir.

262
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,240
I'll be there in five minutes!

263
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Hello.

264
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Hi.

265
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,420
It's Woo-young, right?

266
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Well,

267
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,960
yes. I didn't bring an umbrella.

268
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,990
Could you just walk me to that bus stop?

269
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,600
Why couldn't I? Of course.

270
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,710
What are you doing?

271
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,980
Just walk me to the car.

272
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,250
Hey! I'm getting soaked because of you!

273
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,950
Come on.

274
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,350
Goodness!

275
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,990
Let's eat together sometime.

276
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,090
No way!

277
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,530
Your shoulder is soaked. Are you okay?

278
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I'm fine.

279
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,910
I have to catch that bus.

280
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,450
Let's eat together sometime.

281
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,350
Eat together?

282
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,760
When a man says,

283
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,200
"Let's eat together sometime,"
what do you think that means?

284
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,400
That's what old men say all the time.

285
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,570
It wasn't an old man!

286
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,050
I must be crazy. He's just a teenager.

287
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,890
Why? You said that you're out of lipstick.

288

294
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,430
what do I do?

295
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,200
What is it? Could anything possibly get
worse from now?

296
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,900
I got in.

297
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,810
I made it into JBC!

298
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,640

My goodness!

302
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,450
I take back calling you an idiot earlier!

303
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,250
You're the smartest girl ever!

304
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,620
I got in!

- My goodness!
- I'm so happy for you!

306

Seriously.

I'm glad I ran into you.
Do you want to eat anything?

314
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,480
I'll buy anything for you.

315
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
Why would you do that?

316
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,690
I said I'm buying. Just name it.

Ms. Jung Da-jung,
were you in a beauty pageant?

319
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,010
No.

have stiff facial expressions.

322
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,780
But your smile looks natural. 
I must have gotten the wrong idea.

323
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,350
I practiced it every day
in front of a mirror.

324
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,050
- I see.
- That must be why.

325

You scored a very high number
on your written exam.

326
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,220
But why did you graduate so late?

327
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,930
I went to college late because I wanted to

328
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,300
focus on my children
until they started elementary school.

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,070
All right. Ms. Park Jin- young.

333
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,210
You have a great resume given your age.

334
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,650
My mother is also an anchor.

335
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,420
So that definitely helped.

336
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,020
Can you tell us who your mother is?

337
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,090
My mom is Ha Kyung- ha.

338
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,190
- I see. I knew it.
- Gosh. No wonder.

339
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,790
That explains.

340
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,450
Did the interview go well?

341
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,650
It was okay.

342
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,720
Did something happen?

343
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,890
Well, I got a bit nervous
during the interview.

344
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,200
I think I might not get the job again.

345
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,300
If they don't hire you, that just proves
they can't see talent when they see one.

346
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,670
You did well. You were fantastic.

347
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,540
So don't blame yourself
even if you don't get the job.

348
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,380
If not this year,
you can try again next time.

349
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,650
Right?

350
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Let's go.

351
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,660
Did you eat?

352
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,330
Would he be happy for me if he knew?

353
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,480
Thank you for the food today.
I'll buy next time.

354
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,080
That's all right.

355
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,650
If you have any cravings, let me know.
I'll buy you anything you want.

356
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,350
- Why would you do that?
- What?

357
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,960
We're friends.

358
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,030
Si-woo, why don't we play basketball
to help digest all this food?

359
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,830
No, I don't want to. I'm not good at it.

360
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,130
You were pretty good.

361
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,330
How come you don't have
any confidence about yourself?

362
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,500
Si-woo.

363
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,980
I guess you're very close with Woo-young.

364
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,920
Woo-young.

365
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,520
I'm sorry about the other day.

366
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,630
- Why are you sorry?
- It's nothing.

367
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,130
It's all right.

368
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,600
It was

369
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,340
a misunderstanding. I can understand.

370
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,700
Thank you.

371
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,070
You're quite mature, Woo-young.

372
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,180
- I'll get going.
- Okay. Bye.

373
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,050
Si-woo, I have great news.

374
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,350
I got the job at JBC!

375
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,590
Really? Are you an announcer now?

376
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,720
Yes.

377
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,890
Congratulations.

378
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,260
Thank you, Si-woo. Give me a hug.

379
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,400
Congratulations, Mom.

380
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,940
(JBC)

381
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,080
(JBC)
(What?)

382
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,310
(JBC)

383
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,480
A mom?

384
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,050
A mom, not with elementary school kids.

385
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,020
She's a mom with twins
who go to high school?

386
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,990
A mom was ranked first
in the open recruitment at JBC?

387
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,830
The higher- ups will give us an earful

388
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,160
for holding a blind test
just to hire a mom!

389
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,670
You gave her an A.

390
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,640
Hey, before this gets out of hand,

391
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,080
rid the result.

392
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,420
(Application,
delete bias- provoking entries)

393
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,980
All right.

394
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,020
This girl. Okay. She had
the fourth highest mark. Who is this girl?

395
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,720
Kwon Yu- mi. Okay?

396
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,890
It looks like she's the youngest
and has the most potentials to be a star.

397
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,660
(Application, Kwon Yu- mi)

398
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,160
Put her in first place.

399
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Okay.

400
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,500
Can I eat at your restaurant?

401
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,440
You still haven't made up with your mom?

402
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,810
How did you know?

403
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,340
If you're sorry, just apologize to her
and make up already.

404
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,110
I'm sure she's waiting to make up too.

405
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,120
You used to be a scaredy- cat
who followed me around.

406
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,450
You're all grown up now.

407
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,690
Hey, I didn't follow you around.

408
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,820
What?

409
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,430
Do you really not remember?

410
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,330
(8 years ago)

411
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,310
You should come up too. It's fun.

412
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,910
- I'm scared.
- It's not scary at all.

413
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,150
Should I hold your hand?

414
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,280
It's all right.

415
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,030
How does it feel?
Aren't you happy that you're up here?

416
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,200
Yes.

417
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,660
We used to go home like this
when we were little.

418
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,100
Now that you're up there again,
I can see that you haven't changed at all.

419
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,870
You should come up too.

420
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,610
Don't tell me

421
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,180
you're still scared.

422
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,710
I'm scared that
someone might see me like that.

423
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,080
You're not a kid anymore.
Why are you doing that? It's embarrassing.

424
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,250
What?

425
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,950
It startled me.

426
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,380
Let's go.

427
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,800
Is the skirt too short?

428
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,650
(Mom, I'm sorry about
what I said the other day.)

429
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,350
(A token of my apology
and a gift for the job.)

430
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,370
Si-a.

431
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,370
Your allowance isn't much.
How did you save up money?

432
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,240
Have a good first day at work.

433
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,040
Are you leaving now?

434
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,450
Yes. How do I look?

435
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,250
Is the skirt too short?

436
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,720
You look just fine.

437
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,660
Am I overthinking this?

438
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,000
Don't forget anything.
I'm going to work now.

439
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,070
Okay.

440
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,910
Woo-young.

441
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,350
You must be waiting for Si-woo.

442
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,850
Have fun at school.

443
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,780
Excuse me.

444
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,220
Don't you think your skirt is too short?

445
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,620
Oh, is that so?

446
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,190
My kids said it was nice.

447
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,660
I think you would look better
if it was a bit longer.

448
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,400
Is it a bit too much?

449
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,000
You're right. I should change.

450
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,570
I hope

451
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,350
you have a good first day at work.

452
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,850
Right.

453
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,620
Thanks, Woo-young.

454
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,860
I haven't seen her smile in so long.

455
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,400
It's been a while, and she looks pretty.

456
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,810
(Jung Da-jung, JBC)

457
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
Da-jung!

458
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,190
- You passed too!
- Yes!

459
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,400
This is great!

460
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,010
Congratulations on becoming a JBC anchor.

461
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,700
Since you were chosen
based on your skills,

462
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,740
be proud of yourself and work hard.

463
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm Heo Woong- gi, the senior manager
of the Anchor Department.

464
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,240
You were selected during open recruitment,

465
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,080
and your probationary period
is three months long.

466
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,080
After three months,
you will become full- time employees.

467
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,519
So please work hard.

468
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,550
The director is here.

470
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,130
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

471
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,560
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

472
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:26,209
Mr. Heo. How long do you think
you can live as an anchor?

473
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,610
20 years?

474
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,610
I think it's five years.

475
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,880
But

476
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,189
I think that would be too long
for this lady.

477
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,190
Make sure

478
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,730
this lady leaves on her own during the probationary period.

479
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Yes, sir.

480
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,870
(Application, Jung Da-jung)

481
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,210
Congratulations.

482
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,080
Thank you. I'll do my best.

483
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,490
Congratulations.

484
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,030
Drink this, Ms. Lim.

485
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,360
Gosh, Da-jung.
You could call me by my name.

486
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,030
I'll be comfortable around you too.

487
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,100
Then I'll speak comfortably
when it's just us two.

488
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Okay.

489
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,680
Would you like some coffee too, Ms. Kwon?

490
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,540
I'm okay, Ms. Jung.

491
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,750
Ms. Kwon.

492
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,250
Don't put up a wall,
and just call her by her name.

493
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,890
We'll be seeing each other often.

494
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,030
How can we act like that at work,

495
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,830
Ms. Lim?

496
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
What?

497
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,640
Yu- mi.

498
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,700
Yes?

499
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,480
Gosh, I'm dumbfounded by her.

500
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,450
She just doesn't want to call us
by our name, right?

501
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,420
Leave her be.

502
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,080
She's young.

503
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,530
Okay. Pay attention.

504
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,470
We handed out the profiles
for new anchors within the station,

505
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,100
so expect to receive casting calls.

506
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,600
You're aware that whatever show you go on

507
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,000
during this period will go into
your performance assessment, right?

508
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,010
If you fall short in your performance

509
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,110
or there is a broadcasting accident,

510
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,080
you will not become a full- time employee.

511
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,710
Keep that in mind and do your best.

512
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,020
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,720
You're Ms. Kwon Yu- mi, who came in first
in the open recruitment, right?

514
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,130
Yes, I am.

515
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,930
I'm the assistant director
for "Talk and N".

516
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,230
I'm here to cast you.

517
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,300
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

518
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,610
- Are you Ms. Lim Ja- young?
- Yes, I am.

519
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,440
I'm here from
"Investigative Project, Issue Room".

520
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,840
Can we talk for a moment?

521
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,510
- Of course.
- Thank you.

522
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,820
I guess Ja- young is getting cast too.

523
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,920
I'm sure our chance will come soon.

524
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,220
Don't be too down.

525
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,630
Are you Mr. Nam Ki- tae?

526
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,930
I'm here from "On the Site, 25 Hours".
Can we have a meeting?

527
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,560
Of course we can! Let's go!

528
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,630
Thank you.

529
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,570
Ms. Jung Da-jung?

530
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Yes?

531
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,980
Bring three cups of coffee
to the director's room.

532
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,950
Make it iced.

533
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
(Serim High School)

534
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,180
Are those punks serious?

535
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,560
I saw Gu Ja- sung bully you again.

536
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,830
Aren't you going to do anything?

537
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,960
If I keep it in,

538
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,460
it will pass.

539
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,440
Si-woo. If you keep it in,

540
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,540
the strong will get stronger,
and the weak will become weaker.

541
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,240
Then what should I do?

542
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,440
Should I fight with him?
Should I go and get into a fight?

543
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,610
When you need to fight,

544
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
you should.

545
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,990
It's true. I'm not lying. It's true.

546
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,390
It's true.

547
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,190
- Stop lying.
- I'm telling the truth.

548
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,030
It's...

549
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,230
Hey, Gu Ja- sung!

550
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,050
Let's fight.

551
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,720
- There's a fight!
- There's a fight!

552
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,720
Guys, there's a fight outside!

553
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,220
- Let's go outside.
- Let's watch.

554
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,730
- There's a fight outside!
- There's a fight.

555
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,300
- Someone's fighting.
- There's a fight!

556
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,730
Who's fighting who?

557
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,830
- Hey, Hong Si-a.
- Si-a.

558
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Gu Ja- sung and Hong Si-woo
got into a fight.

559
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
What?

560
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,530
- Keep your promise.
- Okay.

561
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,100
If you win,
I won't bother Hong Si-woo anymore.

562
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,530
But if I win,

563
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,940
let me punch you ten times.

564
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,940
Sure.

565
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,180
But that's not going to happen.

566
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,180
You realize that we're
on the basketball team, right?

567
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,620
You're an amateur.
I'll give you some advantage.

568
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,750
Come at me first.

569
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,590
Look at you, underestimating me.

570
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,490
We're playing for ten points.

571
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,810
Si-woo, it's okay.
Just play as you've been playing.

572
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,150
Got it?

573
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,040
Why do you keep following Si-woo?

574
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,840
Because you feel bad?

575
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,980
Do you play basketball with your mouth?

576
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,600
He's so cool!

577
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,810
Si-woo!

578
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,350
- You did it!
- This is awesome.

579
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,720
That's my son.

580
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,450
Si-woo!

581
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,090
That's incredible.

582
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,760
You did it!

583
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,260
No way!

584
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,500
Great job.

585
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Get out of my way.

586
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,980
You don't have to be embarrassed
about losing.

587
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,510
But you should be embarrassed
that you contradicted yourself

588
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,720
as a man.

589
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,820
I get it! Get out of my way.

590
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,210
When you said that you wanted to fight,

591
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,510
I thought you wanted to fight with fists.

592
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,480
What kind of a person do you think I am?

593
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,990
Violence isn't the answer to everything.

594
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,390
Hey,

595
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,130
it's really a waste of talent.

596
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,330
If someone like you doesn't
play basketball, then who will?

597
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,700
You're the tallest one and also the best.

598
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,530
You're being too nice.

599
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,540
There are lots of kids who can play
as good as I can.

600
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,070
Don't be discouraged.

601
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,470
At school and in life,

602
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,610
as long as you're good at one thing,

603
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,750
nobody can look down on you.

604
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,580
You're a great basketball player.

605
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,160
Let's get going now.

606
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,530
Hong Si-woo!

607
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,460
You're pretty good.

608
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,770
I heard that your dad was
a failed basketball player.

609
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,940
I guess you could still learn
from a failure like that.

610
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,040
How dare you?

611
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,440
- What was that?
- Don't bring parents into this.

612
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,910
You lunatic.

613
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,050
Lunatic?

614
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,220
Don't attack me like that!

615
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,090
I thought you said
violence isn't the answer to everything.

616
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,090
Si-woo, do you want to watch
baseball together?

617
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,730
- Baseball?
- Yes.

618
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,300
(Daehan versus Seum)

619
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,120
Go!

620
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,790
You can do it!

621
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,240
This is an emergency! He bailed!

622
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,870
I knew he'd cause trouble one day.
That crazy jerk.

623
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,440
All right. I'll find someone
and send them over.

624
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,010
Darn it.

625
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,210
Do you know anyone
who's not filming right now?

626
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,620
All right.

627
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,850
How can we not have enough people
when we just hired some?

628
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,590
Is nobody there?

629
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,030
I'm here, sir!

630
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,970
Are you the only one here, Ms. Jung?

631
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,770
Yes, I am.

632
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,940
I see. This is where it all ends for me.

633
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,150
- Sorry?
- Never mind.

634
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,850
It's getting late, so you should go home.

635
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,250
All right. I'll get going now.

636
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,900
Whatever.

637
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,330
The point is to put the fire out,
not which firefighter puts it out.

638
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,970
Ms. Jung!

639
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,570
Ms. Jung!

640
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,640
- Yes, sir?
- Could you put the fire out?

641
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,650
- Ms. Jung?
- Yes.

642
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,560
There are only a few minutes
until the game is over.

643
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,790
You're going in right away,
so get ready to talk.

644
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,430
Do I get a script?

645
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,590
What do you mean, a script?
You need to write it yourself.

646
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,860
This is the record of the game tonight.
Write a script with this and come down.

647
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,130
Listen, Ms. Jung.

648
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,670
A live broadcast isn't a walk in the park.

649
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,770
Just please don't cause any trouble,
all right?

650
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,180
Let's go, team!

651
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,910
Let's go!

652
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,310
Let's win!

653
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,050
(Daehan versus Seum)

654
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,520
(Daehan versus Seum)
Strike two!

655
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,250
Strike two!

656
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,960
(Let's go!)

657
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,400
(The end!)

658
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,100
(The game is over!)

659
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,730
The final score is 6 to 0.

660
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,440
Player Ye Ji-hoon,
that was a perfect game.

661
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,670
Yes, Ye Ji-hoon rescues
Thursday night as usual!

662
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,480
He's going to be the model
for our company.

663
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,310
It'll definitely be a hit if he models.

664
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,880
Our Ji-hoon.

665
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,520
This is alcohol!

666
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:06,020
Sorry, I forgot that you quit drinking.

667
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,790
Come on.

668
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,690
(Seum is taking two wins in a row.)

669
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,700
(They strongly remain in first place.)

670
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,400
(I will now finish broadcasting the game.)

671
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,630
(- Next up is Ye Ji-hoon's interview.)
- It's not what it looks like.

672
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,580
I've never seen you before.

673
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,010
Yes, nice to meet you.

674
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,950
Don't be nervous.

675
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,350
I'm not.

676
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,590
Don't you ever get nervous,
no matter what happens.

677
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,930
Okay, no matter what happens.

678
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,000
Standby!

679
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,340
All right. Cue!

680
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,080
(We now have Player Ye Ji-hoon
with us here.)

681
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,280
Mom?

682
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,920
Congratulations on winning tonight.

683
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,780
Thank you.

684
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,660
That lunatic.

685
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,920
Where's the template for an apology?

686
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,360
Gosh.

687
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,230
It was pretty hot today.

688
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,860
Getting splashed like that
chased away the heat.

689
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,630
I guess you can only have
celebratory gestures

690
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,740
like this one
because you guys won today, right?

691
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,470
(Yes. I did get splashed all over me.)

692
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,910
(But it does feel good.)

693
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,380
Nice, Da-jung. Gosh. She's pretty good.

694
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,080
(Ji-hoon, you allowed 5 batters hit over 9 innings.)

695
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,150
(You struck out five batters without allowing any points.)

696
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,920
(This is your first shutout game this season.)

697
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,150
(Apology Letter)

698
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
What?

699
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,460
(Are you satisfied with your performance today?)

700
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,560
(That's not my focus.)

701
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,500
(I wanted to do my best for every pitch.)

702
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,000
(You're indeed humble.)

703
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,500
(Here's a fun fact about your stats.)

704
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,840
Among 16 wins from last season,

705
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,040
your team won 10 games on Thursday.

706
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,610
Did you expect
your team to win again today?

707
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,380
No, I didn't.

708
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,850
(Could you tell us the driving force
behind your wins?)

709
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,550
I handled this hiccup!

710
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,050
(I play for my loved ones.)

711
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,190
You're good, Da-jung.

712
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,120
Recently, you turned down an offer
from the MLB,

713
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,890
which was the talk of the town.

714
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,360
Did your loved ones affect
your decision process?

715
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,330
That's right.

716
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,570
Besides,

717
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,100
I can't live without kimchi.

718
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,040
All right. Let's wrap up now.
You have 10 seconds.

719
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,250
(I'm very much looking forward to 
your future games in Korea.)

720
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,880
My gosh. Your mom is so cool.

721
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,980
She's amazing.

722
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,750
(- Congratulations on your win again.)
- Right.

723
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,290
(- Thank you.)
- Five seconds.

724
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,590
All right. That was my interview
with Ji-hoon from Seum.

725
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,310
- Woo-young.
- Yes?

726
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,910
Should I play with you too?

727
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
I mean, basketball.

728
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,750
Yes. Of course.

729
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,560
I'd love to.

730
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,590
Okay. Let's play together.

731
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Okay.

732
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,220
Good work today.

733
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,350
It sounded like
you were well- versed in baseball.

734
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,120
I'll see you again.

735
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,920
Thank you.

736
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,870
I can go home now.

737
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,570
Where's the bus stop?

738
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,150
Gosh.

739
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,980
- What?
- What?

740
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,790
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

741
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,450
Please move, then.

742
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,760
Oh, right.

743
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,890
You really didn't get nervous earlier.

744
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,030
I told you I don't get nervous.

745
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,430
I'm nervous around a woman
who doesn't get nervous.

746
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,740
Pardon?

747
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
That's a compliment.

748
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,840
By the way, are you my fan?

749
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,140
You knew a lot about me.

750
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,410
Oh, that.

751
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,150
One of my men at home
is a hardcore fan of yours.

752
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,980
I see.

753
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,250
You weren't my fan.

754
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,120
A man at home... Is it your father?

755
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,690
You can answer that. I'll get going now.

756
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,870
Hey, Seo- yeon. Where are you?

757
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,640
Yes. I'll pick you up.

758
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,570
Okay.

759
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,560
(No way. Mom, you went viral.)

760
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,920
(Check online now.)

761
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,060
I did?

She's so quick on her feet.)

Hey, Woo-young.

777
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,810
You came in those clothes?

778
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,380
I'm a mess, am I?

779
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,350
You're completely wet.

780

What? It's okay.

782
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,690
I'm not okay with it.

783
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,390
Those people at your work are so mean.

784
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,730
How can they just let you leave like this?

785
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,460
They should give you dry clothes

786
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,000
or at least give you a ride.

787
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,870
This is upsetting.

788
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,780
You'll catch a cold.

789
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,350

By the way...

793
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,100
I'll go. You can answer that.

794
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,970
Okay. Thank you.

795
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,970
Thank you for this.
I'll return this to you.

796

Yes, Da-jung.

803
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,640
I saw the interview.

804
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,040
Congratulations.

805

I am so proud of you.

806

Thank you.

807
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,910
But what do you need to talk to me about?

808
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,910
I just did.

809
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,590
I wanted to congratulate you in person.

810
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,490
I see.

811
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,860
Get in. I'll drop you off.

812
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,190
No. It's right around the corner.

813
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,330
Get in. Let me drop you off.

814
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,080
Thank you for the ride.

815
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Da-jung.

816
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,400
You were

817
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,470
amazing today.

818
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,140
Okay. Thank you.

00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,730
(She got pregnant when she was in school.)

823
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,700
(I went to the same high school with her.
She got pregnant when she was in school.)

824
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,040
(No way. She got pregnant
out of wedlock and became a mom?)

825
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,140
(She's a mom. Go take care of your kids.)

826
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,010
(I knew it. She looked like that type.)

827
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,480
(Who said she was the kindest? Fess up.)

828
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,550
(I'll block JBC and skip it.)

829
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,680
(Yes. I didn't like her
when I first saw her.)

830
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,790
(She's 37. Then, are her children
in high school now?)

831
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,490
(This is how JBC betrays its viewers.)

832
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,160
(I feel so betrayed. I take back
what I said. You aren't my type.)

833
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,860
(- Are her children in high school now?
- I knew it.)

834
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,160
(Does she not care about her kids?)

835
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,100
(She's gone after going viral for a day.)

836
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,500
(Why did JBC hire her?)

837
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,670
(- I knew it. She was good at flirting.
- Who is this nobody?)

838
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,440
(She's so greedy.
Stay home and raise your kids.)

839
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,020
The anchor who got splashed
is Hong Si-a's mom.

840
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,260
- She is?
- Yes.

841
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,460
No way.

842
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,260
She was pregnant with Si-a
when she was in high school.

843
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,830
- I knew it. Si-a takes after her mother.
- Yes.

844
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,000
What? Like her face?

845
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,530
Right.

846
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,300
Both of them have big eyes and fair skin.

847
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,370
No, not that.

848
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,740
Girls with faces like hers

849
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,140
are bound to be troublemakers.

850
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,470
Gosh.

851
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,080
Come on, man.

852
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,310
Hong Si-a will cause trouble any day now.

853
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,600
Let go.

854
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,040
My goodness. Oh, no.

855
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,480
Hey, do you not want to live anymore?

856
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,780
I kill anyone that hits me.

857
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,380
Is that so? Go ahead.

858
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,410
- Stop it.
- Let go of me!

859
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,700
You've got to be kidding me.

860
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,110
Give me all you've got.

861
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,060
(Customer Service Center)

862
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,590
Thank you, sir.

863
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:21,030
(June of 2008)

864
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,370
Hello?

865
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,970
Are you still sleeping?

866
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,240
I'm up.

867
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,650
Then, send the kids to kindergarten now.

868
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,320
Hurry.

869
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,290
Hello. How may I help you?

870
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,890
What's today's play?

871
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:47,490
- "The Tortoise and the Hare".
- "The Tortoise and the Hare".

872
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,830
I can just draw whiskers with this marker, right?

873
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:51,790
- Yes!
- Yes!

874
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,030
You're first, Si-woo.

875
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,240
(- Hong Dae-young.)
- Hey, Da-jung.

876
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,810
Do you not know how the whiskers look?

877
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,010
The hare's whiskers? I do.

878
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,380
As if.

879
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:08,250
(I'll be home late. Can you pick up the kids?)

880
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,650
Okay.

881
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,660
Gosh.

882
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,000
- Dad.
- Goodness.

883
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,400
Thank you.

884
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,530
Did you have to wait long?

885
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

886
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,940
What should we eat for dinner?

887
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,440
I want fried rice.

888
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,510
Should we eat fried rice?

889
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,310
How about tteokbokki? Let's get going.

890
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,310
I want cheese tteokbokki.

891
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,310
Well,

892
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,620
you drew them with a permanent marker,
so they aren't going away.

893
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,090
My gosh, I'm sorry.

894
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,800
(On rainy days, people can measure how big their love is.)

895
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,460
(Even when they share umbrellas,)

896
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,230
(as everyone holds them at different angles,)

897
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,100
(it's clearly visible how big their love is.)

898
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,840
(So love and rain come hand in hand.)

899
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,110
It's raining a lot.

900
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,620
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

901
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,850
I drew you the wrong whiskers.

902
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,520
Why? I had fun.

903
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:24,120
Right. The kids laughed too.

904
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,560
Is that so?

905
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,160
Come closer.

906
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,630
You'll catch a cold if you get rained on.

907
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

908
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,770
Should we eat a delicious meal at home?

909
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

910
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,240
- Let's go.
- Okay.
