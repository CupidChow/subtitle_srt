00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,270
You'll like it if someone confesses
their feelings like that.

168
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,780
Are you crazy? It makes me want to barf.

169
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,510
It makes you want to barf?

170
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,320
I really shouldn't tell you this.

171
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,220
What is it?

172
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,790
In return,

173
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,030
don't tell anyone I told you this.

174
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,560
Okay.

175
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,700
Si-a wants

176
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,500
someone to confess to her

177
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,270
in front of a lot of people through songs.

178
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,910
Then get on your knees
and give her a bouquet of flowers.

179
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,340
Then it will be perfect.

180
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,850
Does she really like that kind of thing?

181
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,150
I'm telling you the truth.

182
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,350
Hey.

183
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,420
Just give up.

184
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,550
She said she won't accept anything
but a public confession.

185
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,960
How can you do something so embarrassing?

186
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,890
Don't do it.

Si-a is the cause,

189
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,440
she didn't actually do anything.

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,250
You're right.

Okay. We got it.
We're done. Goodness.

Stop acting shy.

We all know you're skipping practice today
to go on a date with Hong Si-a.

If it's your first day, will you hold hands today?

- Hey.
- Hands?

204

He should at least kiss her.

205

Stop it already.

206

- Why not? It's just a kiss.

I'm going to skip practice today too.

I'm worried about something.

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,780
Because our show is the talk of the town,

218

they decided to make it a live broadcast.

219
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,419
Don't worry.

220
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,659
I'll prepare thoroughly for it.

221
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,260
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about myself.

It's my debut program,

223
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,030

a live broadcast.

Okay. Let's do a good job
and make it a regular program.

Let's do it!

Yes. I'm going to
a baseball interview right now.

Oh, really? That's too bad.

235
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,440
A program came in for you,

236
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,940
and this was the talk of the town
around this time of year last year.

It was the talk of the town?

Yes.
But they have to start the shoot today.

239

If you have another shoot,
there's nothing we can do about it.

Yes, I am.

Mr. Heo.

245

Since that program wanted to cast me,

246
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,000
I will go.

247
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,430
Really? Okay, then.

248

in her place,

She was worried something that
is popular will go to you,

so look at her acting like that.

They didn't cast me
for the program anyway.

with Gu Ja-sung.

this back to you.

in front of so many people.

- Could I take a photo with you?
- Of course.

332
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,910
I can feel sadness behind your smile.

333
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,150
That's right.

334
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,150
- It's because of love.
- Feel better.

335
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,420
That love must be real.

336
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
Thank you.

337
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,190
My friend said

338
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,830
that ugly people's love is genuine love.

339
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Ugly?

340
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,010
Would you like to take a photo with me?

341
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,880
Seems like we're the only ones
from Wonderland.

342
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,090
This voice sounds familiar.

343
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,130
Are you Woo-young's father?

344
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,530
Is that you, Ms. Ok?

345
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,870
You didn't see me today, okay?

346
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,110
Ms. Ok, why are you here?

347
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,040
(You, sir, are an anime fan.)

348
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,640
I don't like anime fans.

349
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,550
Hold on, Ms. Ok!

350
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,730
Ms. Ok,

351
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,290
don't be ashamed of yourself.

352
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,600
You look

353
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,230
more beautiful than ever right now.

354
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,100
Have confidence in yourself.

355
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,070
You certainly

356
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,310
deserve it!

357
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,420
Thank you!

358
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,990
At today's game between Daehan and Seum,

359
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,130
after an intense battle for victory,
Seum won by 7 to 3.

360
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,300
I'm Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

361
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,670
Cut! Great job.

362
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,900
Great job.

363
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,770
(Seum Wolves)

364
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,670
(Pitcher Ye Ji-hoon, Seum Wolves)

365
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,180
One, two, three.

366
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,690
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

367
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,990
It's nothing.

368
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,190
Do you want a photo with me as well?

369
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,230
- No!
- No!

370
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,570
Da-jung, nobody is waiting for you today,
right?

371
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,970
No, nobody's waiting.

372
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,740
Why don't we all have dinner together?
My treat.

373
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,280
I'd feel too bad.

374
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,810
I don't want to go yet.

375
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,680
I don't treat my fans often,

376
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,020
but once I start,

377
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,890
I make sure that I do a good job at it.

378
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,130
But even so...

379
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,400
Do you two want to join us too?

380
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,460
- No!
- No!

381
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,070
Mom, let's go with him.

382
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,640
Let's go.

383
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,040
You're my fan too.

384
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,880
Sure, just today then.

385
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,120
(Pitcher Ye Ji-hoon, Seum Wolves)

386
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,460
(Why are all the women in my household
in love with Ye Ji-hoon?)

387
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Right here. You should sit here.

388
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,840
Hey. That's Ji-hoon's seat.

389
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,280
Are you in elementary school?
There are no assigned seats.

390
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,720
What? Elementary school?

391
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,690
I'll move to another seat.
Are you happy now?

392
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,790
Goodness.

393
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,390
What are you doing here?

394
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,700
Why did you tag along?

395
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,470
Because I was hungry.

396
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,980
I think there are more fans of Si-a
than mine.

397
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,910
What?

398
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,150
It's nothing.

399
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,220
Oh, right. Ms. Jung. Will you be
interviewing me again starting today?

400
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,260
No. Ms. Kwon was asked for another show.

401
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,090
I'm just filling in for her today.

402
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,060
I see.

403
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,900
What is she filming?

404
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,900
I don't exactly know.

405
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,100
I just heard that the show gets a lot of attention.

406
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,040
Upon receiving the news
that a typhoon will arrive in Korea,

407
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,170
people are worried about its possible damage.

408
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,810
I was curious about
how strong an actual typhoon would be.

409
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,780
So I decided to experience it firsthand.

410
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,950
(Interactive Hall for Storm and Flood Damage)

411
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,550
(Velocity per second: 10m per second)

412
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,590
The velocity of the wind I'm experiencing now

413
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,490
is 10m per second.

414
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,360
I can somewhat walk in the rain
with an umbrella against the wind.

415
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
The velocity...

416
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,000
(Velocity per second: 30m per second)

417
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,630
...of the wind is 30m per second.

418
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,010
When will your new show air?

419
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,710
Next Monday.

420
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,350
It's a pilot program,
so there is only one episode.

421
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,880
With you on it,
it will be a regular program soon.

422
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,490
I'll make sure to watch it.

423
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,820
It's not something
you'd be interested in, Mr. Ye.

424
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,760
You're on it.

425
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,760
Then, I'll be more than interested
in the show.

426
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,730
Do a good job just like you've been doing.

427
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,770
Thank you.

428
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

429
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,620
Let me. I can do it.

430
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,360
Gosh, no. I'll do it.

431
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,210
Thank you.

432
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,950
You're making it obvious.

433
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,920
What do you mean?

434
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,160
I mean,

435
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,060
it looks like you gave a lot of food
especially to Si-a.

436
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,600
It's nothing like that.

437
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,040
I get where you're coming from,
but that's not cool.

438
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,810
Give some food to Ms. Jung.

439
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,980
It's all right.
I'm not a big fan of clams.

440
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,880
It's all right, Woo-young.

441
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,550
Okay.

442
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,990
- Eat a lot, Ji-ho.
- I'm fine.

443
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,030
Why not? Oh, I see.
Do you want me to take out the clams?

444
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,430
I'm fine. I'll scoop up my own food.

445
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,770
You punk. Fine.

446
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,270
Gosh.

447
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,840
- Then, I guess this is for me.
- Okay.

448
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,740
That looks delicious.

449
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,810
I'll scoop up some for you, Mr. Ye.

450
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,120
Thanks.

451
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,019
- Thank you.
- Here.

452
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,930
Ji-hoon,

453
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,870
can I ask if you have a crush on someone?

454
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,530
What?

455
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,670
Why do you ask?

456
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,610
I mean, I saw your interview
about your ideal type of woman.

457
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,780
The description was very detailed.

458
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,810
It sounded like

459
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,120
you were describing someone
you had in mind.

460
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
I see.

461
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,890
Si-a.

462
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,730
It's all right.

463
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,740
Actually...

464
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,590
there's a woman I like.

465
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,130
But it's only a crush.

466
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,430
I haven't told her yet.

467
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,710
Okay. I got it.

468
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,350
Why are you out here?

469
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,190
I had to call someone.

470
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,250
Is that so?
I'll see you inside after your call.

471
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,390
Wait.

472
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,630
I hope you don't treat
all women like that.

473
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,260
"Like that"?

474
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,830
You ask her about the smallest things,
take an interest in her life,

475
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,530
root for her, and so on.

476
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,340
I don't think you're talking about Si-a.

477
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,670
Are you talking about Ms. Jung?

478
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,540
Just answer my question.

479
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,080
Why does it look like you're mad at me?

480
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,250
I'm not mad.

481
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,020
Who knows?

482
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,920
Depending on your answer, I might be mad.

483
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,330
Why are you laughing?

484
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,800
I mean,

485
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,500
I can understand why you've been
so hostile against me all this time.

486
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,770
I can understand it.

487
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,910
When you're young,
you do have fantasies about women

488
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,510
because you lack a sense of reality.

489
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,050
- Gosh.
- But it's only a fantasy

490
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,550
because it won't come true.

491
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,720
Well, men grow up as they get hurt.

492
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,530
What is he talking about?
That annoying brat.

493
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,740
Wait, Ms. Jung.

494
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,370
This was my treat.

495
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,740
My daughter and her friends had
most of the food. I ought to pay for this.

496
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,910
Gosh. Let me pay for this today.
Can you buy a meal next time?

497
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,280
I will let you pay for our next meal.
Let me pay for this one.

498
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,850
Your bill has already been paid for.

499
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,950
Pardon? Who did?

500
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,690
That young man did.

501
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,030
Woo-young. Did you pay for the meal?

502
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,090
Why?

503
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,360
My father didn't have dinner yet.

504
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,330
I paid for the meal
when I was buying the dumplings.

505
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,230
You're only a student.
Wasn't that expensive?

506
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,370
Yes. I agree. Wait.
Let me give you some cash.

507
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,570
It's fine.

508
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,610
I paid with his card.
Let's say he bought this meal.

509
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,410
I feel bad for Deok-jin.

510
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,020
Goodness.

511
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,760
Ms. Ok, when did you first
get into this world?

512
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,200
I started this

513
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,270
because I was a huge fan of Iron Man.

514
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,010
It was fun. It was a good way
to relieve my stress.

515
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,510
You cannot tell anyone
that you saw me here today.

516
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,120
Must you go that far to hide this?

517
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,750
Of course, I must.

518
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,420
Everyone will think that I'm an oddball
for doing this when I'm a teacher.

519
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,260
Why are teachers who do costume play
considered odd?

520
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,660
You must own it.

521
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,530
If a schoolteacher

522
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,870
goes around in this costume,

523
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,500
no parents would trust me
and send their children to my school.

524
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,570
It's impossible.

525
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,380
Well,

526
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,610
I think of
three impossible things a day on purpose.

527
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,820
First,

528
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,090
Iron Man will become the model
for a game made by my company.

529
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,190
Second,

530
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,690
a 37-year-old man can turn into
an 18-year-old teenager.

531
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,130
And lastly,

532
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,660
Ms. Ok will eventually realize
how I feel about her.

533
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,980
No matter what you say to me,

534
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,680
the fact that I'm abnormal won't change.

535
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,550
It seems that way.

536
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,150
Pardon?

537
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,860
This is a secret,

538
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,360
but all cool people are abnormal.

539
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,820
What do you think?
Does it fit your palate?

540
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,590
I remembered that you like dumplings
which is why I bought them.

541
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,020
Do you remember that?

542
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,790
Yes. It's delicious.

543
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Thank you.

544
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,200
I'll buy some for you more often.

545
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,570
How's school?

546
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,870
Does anyone bully you?

547
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,440
Gosh, Father.
Why would you worry about that?

548
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,580
You're right.

549
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,220
You may look like a child,
but you're a full-grown adult.

550
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,720
I'm making a fuss for no reason.

551
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,790
I understand.

552
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,120
No matter how old a child is, they're
still a kid in their parents' eyes.

553
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,490
When you were young,

554
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,030
I scolded you quite a lot.

555
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,870
You were quite bossy.

556
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,300
What? Weren't you like that too?

557
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,170
Of course I was.

558
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,480
I thought I wouldn't be like that,

559
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,080
but as I was raising my kids,

560
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,050
I realized I became bossier than you were.

561
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,880
Really?

562
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Yes.

563
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,750
I scolded my kids a lot,

564
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,190
and I would always be stubborn
and lecture them.

565
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I thought

566
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,390
it was for my kids,

567
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,500
but it was all for myself.

568
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Now that I became friends with my kids,

569
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,670
I understand how they feel now.

570
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,610
I was lacking in many ways too.

571
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,080
Father, please eat these before
they get cold.

572
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,220
Okay.

573
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
Thank you.

574

("Couples in Crises")

575
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,910
- Please review everything one last time.
- Okay.

576
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,880
We have 10 seconds before we're on air.

577
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,950
Ready, cue!

578
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,890
- It's starting.
- Grandma, it's airing.

579
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,970
This is the pilot episode of
"Couples in Crises", a live talk show

580
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,200
that has never been done before.

581
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm your host, Jung Da-jung.

582
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,650
I don't think I can do live broadcasts.

583
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,990
You're right. It's their first episode.

584
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,890
What if something goes wrong?

585
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,890
Why would you say something so unlucky?

586
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,800
What do you mean?
I doubt anything bad will happen.

587
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,070
(For divorce, Against divorce)

588
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,110
(For divorce: 11, Against divorce: 53)

589
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,010
More than half of our audience

590
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,550
say they are against the divorce

591
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,650
of the woman who wants a divorce as
she has three sisters-in-law.

592
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,560
I know.

593
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,860
I don't understand why this is a problem.

594
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,300
If you knew what kind of people
my sisters-in-law were,

595
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,130
everyone here would support the fact
that I want a divorce.

596
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,570
Okay.
We'll start by hearing the wife's side of the story.

597
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,170
What kind of problems were there?

598
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,380
I would get so stressed out every time
I had to prepare

599
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,110
for my sisters-in-law's birthdays.

600
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,050
They're not grateful for any gifts I give them.

601
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,150
If I get them different gifts,
they ask me why I'm discriminating them.

602
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,190
If I get them the same gifts,
they say I wasn't being thoughtful enough.

603
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,190
What do they want from me?

604
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,060
("Couples in Crises")

605
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,860
What are you guys so focused on?

606
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,030
Hello, sir.

607
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,870
We were watching the divorce program
that Ms. Jung is hosting.

608
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,070
Would you like to join us?

609
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,440
Forget it. What's so fun about
other people getting a divorce?

610
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,040
I'm going to go home,
so finish things up and go.

611
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,310
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

612
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,740
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

613
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Goodness.

614
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,480
(Also, they fight among themselves often.)

615
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
But if I listen to them while they are fighting,

616
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,790
they get mad at me for not taking their sides.

617
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,990
If I join them and say something,

618
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,160
they get mad that I talked ill about their family.

619
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,360
Then they go to my mother-in-law
and talk badly about me.

620
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,460
Then you shouldn't listen to them.

621
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,100
- What is he saying?
- Is he serious?

622
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,200
I listened to them
because I wanted to be on good terms.

623
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,100
Do you think I listened to
them because I wanted to?

624
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,940
I can relate to the wife's side.

625
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,540
Why can't they do that?

626
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,380
How often do you meet your sisters-in-law in a year?

627
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,320
Why can't you just endure it?

628
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,020
I can't. Listen.

629
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,650
All of his sisters are unmarried,

630
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,520
and they all live with their parents.

631
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,090
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's terrible.

632
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,390
- I want to change mine.
- Me too.

633
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,930
- I wouldn't be able to live like that.
- I can't.

634
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,270
(For divorce, Against divorce)

635
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,410
(For divorce: 54, Against divorce: 10)

636
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,340
Is that a good enough reason for a divorce?

637
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,140
That's worth getting a divorce over.

638
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,750
Is marriage a joke?

639
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:17,910
Why isn't he leaving?

640
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,650
I have no idea.

641
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,550
(The majority of the people are for the divorce.)

642
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,260
Dr. Park Jae-in.
What do you think about this?

643
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,090
Yes. From a psychological perspective,

644
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,760
I'm against this divorce.

645
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,000
I believe that the problem lies entirely with the wife.

646
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,570
- What is he saying?
- Is he serious?

647
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,770
- How is she the problem?
- What is he saying?

648
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,370
What is the problem?

649
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,910
If she knew he had three sisters,

650
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,610
she never should've gotten married.

651
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,510
- Is he serious right now?
- How can he say that?

652
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,980
Is that so?
Then I really should get a divorce.

653
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,250
Not at all.
You got married despite knowing,

654
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,950
so you should take responsibility for it.

655
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,190
I don't want to.
I'm going to get a divorce!

656
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,160
I said you can't!

657
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,490
I have three older sisters too,

658
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,430
and if you do, I'll be in trouble.

659
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,030
What? You have three older sisters?

660
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,270
How can you say that when you know what it's like?

661
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,670
Ma'am, please calm down.

662
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,810
Hey. How can you stay quiet in a situation like this?

663
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,040
You're right.
Who said I wanted to go on a TV show?

664
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,010
You're right. It's all my fault.

665
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,820
This show and our marriage
is all my fault!

666
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,020
You're right. It's all your fault.

667
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,620
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

668
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,220
- What did you say?
- What's wrong with him?

669
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,560
Goodness.
I refuse to be on this show anymore.

670
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,230
Gosh.

671
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
Oh, no.

672
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,700
Darn it.

673
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,770
Oh, my. What are they going to do?

674
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,300
- We're on TV...
- Get lost.

675
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Goodness.

676
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,370
(Honey. Honey!)

677
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,270
What's this? Is this...

678
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,240
- Is this a broadcasting accident?
- Will Da-jung be okay?

679
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,920
- What should we do, sir?
- Do we have a video to play?

680
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,850
Of course we don't!

681
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,190
(What should I do?)

682
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,790
I would like to apologize to all of our viewers.

683
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,330
Our guests do not wish to continue with the shoot

684
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,000
and have left the stage.

685
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,240
(We apologize for the unexpected situation)

686
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,570
(during our live broadcast.)

687
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,280
My gosh. How amazing. She's so cool.

688
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,410
- Seriously.
- Of course. She's my daughter after all.

689
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,910
(They say)

690
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,620
(a marriage is when two families come together as one.)

691
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,420
(They say things have gotten better,)

692
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,490
(but often times women end up
sacrificing themselves when they get married.)

693
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,660
(A son-in-law is a guest for 100 years,)

694
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,030
so you can't be negligent towards them.

695
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,600
However, a daughter-in-law is not a guest

696
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,570
but a part of the family.

697
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:53,040
And under the name of family,
they demand service.

698
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,440
Since this kind of mentality still exists,

699
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,970
this is why
these kinds of conflicts occur.

700
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,710
If a daughter-in-law is respected like a guest,

701
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,110
this sad situation wouldn't have occurred.

702
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,850
Live Talk Show, "Couples in Crises".

703
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,890
We'll meet the next couple
after a commercial break.

704
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,160
Oh, the commercial.

705
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,660
(You can become young again too.)

706
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,030
- Jung Da-jung is really good.
- I agree.

707
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,140
If it was me, this would've
been a broadcasting accident.

708
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,500
Gosh, me too.

709
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,070
Is that hard?

710
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,840
I think I would've done the same thing.

711
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,910
- You?
- You?

712
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,690
We'll take a look at the results.

713
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:47,090
(For divorce: 40, Against divorce: 24)

714
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,530
As you can see, more people are for the divorce.

715
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:52,960
Ms. Lee,

716
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,870
divorce rates in couples in the mid-30s
who both work have been increasing, right?

717
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,130
Yes, two of the main reasons are

718
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,040
one party having to do most of the work raising
their children and doing chores.

719
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,580
Seems like if the husband agrees to do
those things together,

720
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,640
they won't need a divorce.

721
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,250
Sir, why haven't you been helping out
with the house chores?

722
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,820
I do help out.

723
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,050
You help out?

724
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,020
I'm so stressed and tired from work,

725
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,490
but when I come home, I still do
some chores and look after our kid.

726
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,090
I did a lot on my end!

727
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,060
But she keeps nagging and screaming at me
because it's not good enough.

728
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,400
He's lying.

729
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,470
What?

730
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,300
You didn't try.

731
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,970
All you do is lie down when you're home.

732
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,140
When I come home, I feed our kid

733
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,540
and do all the chores!

734
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,040
You're not the only one with a job.

735
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,110
That's why I help out on a daily basis!

736
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,880
No, you shouldn't be "helping".

737
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,150
You should be doing them together, anyway!

738
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,210
And

739
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,320
did I get surgery
because you really tried hard?

740
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,420
What?

741
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,420
- She had surgery!
- What?

742
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,090
I had a myoma of uterus removal surgery

743
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,230
six months ago.

744
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,630
I asked the doctor what caused the myoma,

745
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,400
and she said that it's because of stress.

746
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,300
- Come on!
- That's terrible.

747
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,040
Sir, did you know about this?

748
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,640
No, I had no idea.

749
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,140
How was I supposed to know
when she doesn't tell me anything?

750
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,650
How can I tell you

751
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,220
when you're always in a bad mood
after work?

752
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,150
I see.

753
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,890
Ma'am, you must've had it hard.

754
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,230
That's it for these two.

755
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,730
It's now time for you to make the final decision.

756
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,470
Press O if you're for their divorce,

757
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,200
and X if you're against.

758
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,220
We have a tie.

759
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,250
- Look at that.
- No way.

760
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,620
(For divorce: 32, Against divorce: 32)

761
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,660
- What do we do now?
- I don't know!

762
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,800
Hold on.

763
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,830
We have you, Ms. Jung.

764
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,570
I think you can decide for them.

765
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,040
Me?

766
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,770
Yes, let's do that!

767
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,680
(Anchorwoman Jung will decide.)

768
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,150
Well,

769
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,320
(I am)

770
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,830
against their divorce.

771
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,000
Why do you say so?

772
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,000
Listening to the two talk,

773
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,710
I noticed

774
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,910
that they're not honest to each other.

775
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,110
This is

776
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,980
a common mistake in couples.

777
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,820
At first,

778
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,790
people don't tell their partners

779
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,660
what they're going through
because they don't want to worry them.

780
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,260
The coach gave his blessing.

781
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,460
Thank you for the offer,

782
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,830
but I don't have time for that.

783
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,930
Why not?

784
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,770
Si-woo is sick.
I need to make money for him.

785
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,740
You're drinking again.

786
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,940
Is something wrong?

787
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,980
It's nothing.

788
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,820
When they hide what they're going through,

789
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,720
and when the partner makes
a hurtful comment on top of that,

790
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,220
they get disappointed.

791
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,300
They want their partner to know,

792
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,460
and they want to be understood.

793
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,930
But ironically,

794
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,970
they aren't honest

795
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,370
to their partners.

796
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,220
Sir, you need to pay me
the travel expenses.

797
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,960
That product was discontinued long ago,

798
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,230
so we just don't have the parts.

799
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,500
Why would I pay you
when you've fixed nothing?

800
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,700
Get out!

801
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,600
Sir!

802
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,970
(Sir!)

803
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,610
You didn't get the travel expenses?

804
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:34,180
You need to cover it
out of your pocket, then.

805
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,980
You idiot.

Are you drinking again?

808

Aren't you embarrassed to face our kids?

809
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,460
Are you embarrassed of me?

Gosh, you're so pathetic.

and forget

817
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,550
about the other's heartfelt intentions.

818
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,130
If you get divorced for this reason,

819
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,390
you might regret it later on.

820
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,800
Sounds like you're trying to say

821
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,510
that they'll regret it
if they get divorced.

822
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,640
But Ms. Jung, you got divorced yourself.

823
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,950
- Did he really just say that?
- He went too far.

824
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,350
What's wrong with him?

825
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,650
(How can he say that?)

826
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,390
(- That's going too far.
- I can't believe he said that.)

827
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,030
(So,)

828
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,960
do you regret getting a divorce?

829
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,920
Goodness, what do we do?

830
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,360
Yes.

831
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,790
I regret it.

832
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,510
I regret

833
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,440
not having been honest.

834
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,410
As a married couple,

835
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,320
if we sat down

836
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,690
and had an honest conversation,

837
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,520
and had I known

838
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,460
that my partner struggled

839
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,130
as much as I did all this time,

840
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,430
I would've thanked him

841
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,800
and been able to comfort him.

842
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,410
Come on.

843
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,350
Are you saying

844
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,580
that everyone would be
together if they just talked?

845
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:21,990
(Is that the ultimate solution?)

846
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,030
It's not the ultimate solution,

847
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,230
but at least that way,

848
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,430
(you won't be left with regrets.)

849
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,800
(That's why)

850
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,570
I hope

851
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,970
that before the two make a decision,

852
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,680
they can have
a heart-to-heart conversation.

853
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,620
They say,

854
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,680
marriage gives you your one and only

855
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,790
that isn't your blood-related family.

856
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,560
(If they're your one and only,)

857
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,130
why can't you tell them anything?

858
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,600
You should talk.

859
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,770
Who knows?

860
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,200
You might hear something
that you've been waiting to hear.

861
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,570
(Everyone in the audience is against the divorce.)

862
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:52,180
(For divorce: 0, Against divorce: 64)

863
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,510
("Couples in Crises")

864
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,620
(Can we take a rain check?)

865
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,420
I'm waiting for someone.

866
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,450
Was she waiting for

867
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,160
her ex-husband that night?

868
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,490
This is all we have

869
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,660
for "Couples in Crises".

870
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,700
Thank you for watching our show.

871
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,250
Mom was so cool.

872
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,790
I knew she could do it.

873
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,260
It must be really hard
to be that honest on TV.

874
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,360
I was moved just now.

875
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,130
Right.

876
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,170
Are you crying, Mr. Heo?

877
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,930
Gosh. What? I'm not crying.

878
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,210
No way. She just went viral. She's
at the top of the list on search engines.

879
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,370
Really? Let me see that.

880
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,340
Da-jung is so amazing.

881
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,450
She is sure the best.

882
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,820
She does get a lot of attention.

883
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,120
(If they're your one and only,)

884
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,490
(why can't you tell them anything?)

885
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,130
(You should talk.)

886
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:16,890
(You might)

887
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,430
(hear something that you've been waiting to hear.)

888
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,600
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

889
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

890
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:35,410
I only said those things because
I wanted the show to be entertaining.

891
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,880
I hope you won't be offended.

892
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,250
It's all right.

893
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,450
Yes. All right. On that note,

894
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:46,090
let me give you a lot of clams.

895
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,560
- Here.
- Thank you.

896
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,630
Sure.

897
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,630
Pour me a shot too.
Don't just drink by yourselves.

898
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,140
I can just eat. Give it to me.

899
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,880
As if. I know you don't like clams.

900
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,950
Then, I can take them out.

901
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,680
Don't do anything. This is my job.

902
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:17,450
You're ridiculous.

903
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,070
- Ms. Jung, let me pour you a shot.
- Sure.

904
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,210
You practically saved
the whole show today.

905
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,910
- Good job today.
- Good work.

906
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

907
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,490
I think you drank a lot today.
Are you all right?

908
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,660
I'm fine.

909
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,860
Don't worry. You should go home.

910
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:56,890
I'll get going. Bye.

911
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,500
- Good work today.
- Good work.

912
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,630
- Are you going home now?
- What?

913
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,770
- Bye.
- Bye.

914
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,370
- Bye.
- See you later.

915
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,400
- Bye.
- My goodness.

916
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,690
You did well. You were fantastic.

917
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,390
So don't blame yourself
even if you don't get the job.

918
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,380
You did well.

919
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,680
It's okay.

920
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,620
You did well.

921
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,120
Are you all right?

922
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,960
How much did she drink?

923
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,400
Let me see your face.

924
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,110
Dae-young.

925
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,890
What took you so long?

926
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,030
I've been waiting for you.
