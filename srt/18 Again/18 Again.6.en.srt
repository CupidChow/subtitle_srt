how confident and brave you are.)

(I hope there are only sunshine
and rainbows in your future.)

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,140
(From your number one fan.)

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,140
No way.

5
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,110
You already have a fan?

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,610
Well...

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,850
Goodness. Those look beautiful.

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,850
You should try them on.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,390
Should I?

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,570
Gosh, they are the perfect size.

11
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:00,140
I don't know who it is,
but what a clever fan.

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,270
It's from your number 1 fan.
Your number 1 fan.

13
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,740
I wonder who sent them to you.

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,110
I'm so jealous.

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,610
=Episode 6, A Sincere Heart of Her Number 1 Fan=
They are beautiful.

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,820
Are they expensive?

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,420
(Two days ago)

19
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,190
Oh, yes. I read it.

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,200
Congratulations on your divorce.

21
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,630
Pardon?

22
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,700
All of the players
who started afresh after

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,440
making a debut or switching to
another team with my blessing did well.

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm sure things will work out for you too.

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,779
That applies to divorces too, right?

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,250
Yes.

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,980
A divorce

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,180
is a new start too.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,520
Lately, I've only been criticized
for my divorce.

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,290
This is new.

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,500
Ms. Jung!

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,970
Woo-young. What brings you here?

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,910
To see my dad.

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,780
Who is he?

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,340
He's my sonâ€™s friend.

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,480
I see.

37
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,990
Excuse me.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,060
If you're busy, you can go.

39
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,230
I'll say bye to Ms. Jung for you.

40
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,730
I should say that to you.
If you're busy, you can go.

41
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,400
I'll say bye to her for you.

42
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,730
It doesn't matter.

43
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm going to leave with her.

44
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,210
But why do you keep dropping
honorifics to me?

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,980
What?

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,390
Let's not be so casual
when we met for the first time today.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,470
Are you

48
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,140
Doosan's fan?

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
No.

50
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,670
I see.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Then, Lotte's fan?

52
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,080
No.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,580
Woo-young, you came to see your dad.

54
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,920
You should go upstairs.

55
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,490
I'll get going too, Mr. Ye. Good night.

56
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,090
Let me give you a ride.

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,760
No. There's a direct bus.

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,470
I won't make any stops either.

59
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,370
I feel more comfortable with the bus.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,540
I have nothing to say to that.

61
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,280
Get home safely, Ms. Jung.

62
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,010
Okay. You too.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,850
Woo-young, see you later.

64
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,870
Are you okay?

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,470
Yes. I'm all right,

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,709
but my shoes...

67
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,540
That's the least of your worries.

68
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,640
I don't think you can walk.

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,650
Take my arm. There's a hospital nearby.

70
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm all right. I can walk.

71
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,090
Take my arm.
Let's go to the hospital together.

72
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,500
Goodness.

(The Bone Orthopedics)

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,540
It wasn't fractured.

75
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,540
Your ligament is slightly swollen.

76
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,670
You'll need physical therapy.

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,940
You just need to be careful
for 2 to 3 days.

78
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,910
Okay.

79
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,050
(Shoe Repair)

80
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,750
I did fix them.

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,720
But it's better off buying a new pair.

82
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,120
She wore them for too long.

83
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Is that so?

84
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,400
I'll pay for the slippers too.

85
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,870
(Shoe Repair)

86
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,240
The treatment is over.

87
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,550
Thank you.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,190
Seriously. You should have let me
give you a ride when I offered, right?

89
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,130
The price for ignoring my kindness

90
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,030
can be quite scary.

91
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,530
I didn't ignore you.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
Don't be uncomfortable by it.

93
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,100
It was nothing
more than an act of kindness.

94
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,110
That includes the shoes too.

95
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,580
Well...

96
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,410
Can you accept them this time?

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,750
Wait.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I know how it feels
since I've had a lot of injuries.

99
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,670
It might seem like a minor injury,

100
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,940
but you must be careful
until it's completely healed.

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,770
Take these sneakers

102
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,310
and let me drop you off today.

103
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,709
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.

104
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,520
Getting a thank-you from you will do.

105
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,420
Thank you.

106
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,390
They look good on you.

107
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,470
I'll get the car. Wait on the first floor.

108
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,060
Is your foot okay?

109
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,030
Yes, it's fine.

110
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,100
But why are you still here?

111
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,130
I got your shoes fixed.

112
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,300
Thanks.

113
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,870
Oh, right. How much was it?

(The Bone Orthopedics)

115
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,660
Woo-young.
About what happened at the courthouse.

116
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,490
I don't know what Dae-young was thinking
to ask you for such a favor,

117
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,860
but I'll apologize on his behalf.

118
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,500
Also,

119
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,730
thank you for bringing the letter.

120
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,870
It's nothing.

121
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,839
Get in, Da-jung.

122
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,940
Okay.

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,780
Thank you for today.

124
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,660
I'll see you again.

125
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,750
Why are you so late?
You should've come earlier.

126
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,460
When I tell you who came here,
you'll regret it so much.

127
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,990
Did Iron Man come here or something?

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,990
The person you love most.

(Seum Wolves, Ye Ji-hoon)
Ta-da. It's Ye Ji-hoon.

130
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,300
Ta-da. It's Ye Ji-hoon.

131
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,770
Ye Ji-hoon.

132
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,070
You don't have to be grateful.

133
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,870
I was worried that I made you worry
because I said that

134
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,370
Da-jung was having an affair.

135
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,310
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,110

(To Go Woo-young, Ye Ji-hoon)

138
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,150
Who would like something like this?

139
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,190
What are you doing? I got it just for you.

140
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,030
Hey. While we're on the topic, let's talk.

141
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,790
When you brought up the affair...

142
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,600
Forget it. Why am I even bothering?

143
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,530
Mr. Go...

144
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
- Had an affair?
- Fine.

145
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,700
I'm sorry about the affair.

146
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,570
Of course it's your fault.

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,610
You should just stay still.

148
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,510
- "You"?
- I fed you and gave you a place to stay,

149
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,880
but you're a jerk who isn't grateful.

150
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,980
What, you jerk?

151
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,910
Why don't you just go die, you idiot?

152
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,420
Why would I die, you young punk?

153
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,950
Young punk? I'm a full-grown man.

154
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,050
- I should just beat you up.
- Forget it. I can't hear you!

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,490
- I can't hear you!
- You can't hear me? I'll make you hear me.

156
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,990
- When did I say I wanted this?
- Whatever.

157
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,490
- Don't keep then. I'll keep it.
- Don't show this to me again!

158
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,460
It's all mine, you jerk.

159
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,960
I said, get it rid of it, you punk!

160
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't want to, you idiot!

- He's such a degenerate son.
- I know.

162

Why are you going to the office?

165
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,750
You left in a hurry that day.

166
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,480
She had stomach cramps.

She's okay now.

168
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,650
Thank goodness.

169
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,890
If she's anything like you,
your daughter must be beautiful too.

170
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,760
(What is he saying?)

171
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,900
(I heard he was a player.)

172
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,500
(Is he hitting on me regardless of
whether I'm married or divorced?)

173
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,570
I have a worry. Can I confide in you?

174
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,480
What's your worry?

175
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,010
I thought that

176
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,780
I knew what women liked.

177
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,180
But

178
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,920
there's one person I can't figure out.

179
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,420
(What is this? Is he talking about me?)

180
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,590
What's wrong?

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,530
It's nothing.

182
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,860
(I'm sure it's not me.
Let's not overreact.)

183
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,600
It's probably because that woman

184
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,270
hasn't opened up to you yet.

185
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,170
What should I do?

186
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,310
Caring for her is the most important.

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,310
Women know when they're being cared for.

188
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,750
They can tell when you worry about them,

189
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,280
think about them,

190
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,950
and like them.

191
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,190
Then they will naturally open up to you.

192
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,910

195
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,040
Why do they want me to review
everything I already looked at?

196
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,300
When will I get all of this done?

197
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,380
This is exhausting.

198
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,810
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,460
Woo-young, it's fine. I'll do it.

200
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,270
Okay, then.

201
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,650
I had them with me.

202
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,900
What are you doing here?
Didn't you go home?

203
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,930
- No, I signed for an essay-writing class.
- I see.

204
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,500
What about you? Why are you here?
Didn't you have work today?

205
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,170
I came back after work.

206
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,710
The performance assessment for
History was due today.

207
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,970
It was due at 3 p.m.

208
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,980
I bet it won't get accepted
if you try to hand it in now.

209
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,380
I just don't need to get caught.

210

Let's go together.

Okay.

Gosh. Where is it?

213
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,070
It's probably in that cabinet.

214
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,400
Really? Thank you.

215

Gosh, why won't this open?

218

What is this? It's empty.

219
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,790
(And the two chairs that aren't stable.
They're in the classroom.)

220
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,600
(Right.
Let's go to the teacher's office first.)

221
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:00,700
Follow me.

222
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:04,770
These books.

223
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,369
(We have a lot of old books we can't use.)

224
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,470
(It's just taking up space,
so we need to get rid of all of them.)

225
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,360
Right, the cabinet!

226
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,900

227

228
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,910

It's too old, we can't even use it.

230

See? You can't even open it.

231

I'll switch it to a new one tomorrow.

232

Okay. Let's go.

233

Hello.

240
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,410
Make yourself at home, Ms. Jung.

241
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,210
I know I'm your senior, but I'm younger.

242
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,180
I'm okay.

243
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,580
This is your first night here, right?

244
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,220
There's not much to do, as long as nothing happens.

245
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,890
Okay.

246
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,260
Which academy did you graduate from?

247
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,560
I attended the same one with Yu-mi.

248
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,260
I didn't attend one.

249
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,000
How did you get ready for the exam?

250
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,800
I did it alone at home.

251
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,670
At home?

252
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,070
What, did you read newspapers and highlight them?

253
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,370
Did you make it because it was a blind recruit?

254
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,410
You must be very lucky.

255

What's with the face?

256
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,020
- It's nothing.
- You seem

257
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,190
like you want to say that it was
your talent and hard work,

258
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,760
but I think you're lucky.

259

You're on your probation, and yet,
you've been receiving so much attention.

260
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
I've seen so many anchors

261
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,700
that focus on getting popular
than becoming a good anchor.

262

But those always end up

not making it to the end because they lack skills.

264

As your senior, let me tell you,

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,810
you need to win with your skills
from now on.

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,810
(25 people being evacuated)
(When the fire broke out,)

331
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,880
(the employees nearby the entrance evacuated immediately,)

332
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,850
but those who could not evacuate immediately are

333
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,520
seeing some injuries, including breathing in the smoke.

334
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,090
(20 people injured)
seeing some injuries, including breathing in the smoke.

335
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,050
Is the fire in control?

336
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,960
They're still putting out the minimal fires,

337
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,930
and there's a risk that the strong winds
in the morning may spread the fire,

338
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,830
so cars driving near the area must drive around.

339
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,900
(Risk of spreading fire through the strong wind,)
You mentioned that there was an explosion before the fire.

340
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,200
Has the source of the fire been identified?

341
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,510
Yes. While there's a low chance of anyone intentionally starting the fire,

342
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,840
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, authorities with jurisdiction will be

343
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,610
(collectively investigating on the fire.)

344
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,280
(Investigation to begin at 10 a.m.)

345
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,910
(- The rush hour will be starting soon.)
- She's incredible.

346
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,180
(The Taehwa Bridge will be blocked off
in both directions,)

347
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,450
(The Taehwa Bridge will be blocked off
in both directions,)

348
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,150
(so if you head to work on the bridge,)

349
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,620
(please divert to Gangseo Bridge.)

350
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,530
I'm Jung Da-jung of JBC News, reporting from the scene.

351
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,460
We will expand on more details
as they come in for the morning news.

352
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,000
This concludes our "JBC Breaking News".

353
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,440
("JBC News Breaking News")

354
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,270
Ms. Jung is good.

355
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,980
- How many captions did we get?
- We got 12!

356
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,010
That's a record for breaking news.

357
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,820
Ms. Jung, you did so well!

358
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,350
It was incredible. Great job.

359
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,790
I told her to win with her skills,

360
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,830
and she really did.

361
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,930
Come on.

362
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,100
(Just now, around 4:05 a.m.,)

363
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:56,200
(there was an explosion, bringing fire,)

364
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,100
(Massive fire at Taehwa Industrial Complex)
(there was an explosion, bringing fire,)

365
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,540
(and 25 people in the complex are currently being evacuated.)

366
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,410
(The fire is being put out at the moment.)

367
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,240
This is a view from Mount Nam hindered by the micro dust.

368
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,210
Seoul's micro dust level is still high.

369
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,120
There had been many reports of deaths
due to the high level of micro dust.

370
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,850
What are you doing with the TV on mute?

371
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,960
I'm practicing my report
in case of breaking news.

372
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,960
How do you practice it?

373
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,330
For breaking news,

374
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,060
they make captions based on
the information reporters give out.

375
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,570
You can prove that you're a good reporter
by making as many captions you can.

376
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,830
Okay. I see.

377
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,870
There had been many reports of deaths...

378
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,440
(Early this morning, an apartment in Seoul...)

379
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,950
(It's accompanied by a strong wind.)

380
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,850
(You can expect heavy rains
and strong wind starting tonight.)

381
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,790
(Please prepare yourselves for the storm.)

382
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,590
(Let's take a look at how the government is preparing for this.)

383
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,230
(I'm Jung Da-jung of JBC News, reporting from the scene.)

384
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,060
Well done,

385
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,630
Jung Da-jung.

386
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,170
- Your breaking news coverage was cool.
- Thank you.

387
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,020
Today, Ms. Jung Da-jung
performed very well

388
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,790
- during today's breaking news coverage.
- Yes.

389
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,590
She came up with 12 captions
which is our record.

390
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,390
I watched it on my way here.

391
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,230
Gosh, she's good.

392
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,030
Did Choi Ji-na give her all the tips?

393
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,670
No.

394
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,470
I heard from the field team.

395
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,870
(- All the reporters and anchors were)
- How is it?

396
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,540
(busy putting on makeup.)

397
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,380
(She was the only one
who went around the field)

398
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,510
(and collected information.)

399
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,980
That's why we could get the most captions.

400
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,320
My gosh.

401
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,720
But

402
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,460
did you all read the comments?

403
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,530
- Comments?
- Read them.

404
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,730
(She's new, but she just got a divorce.)

405
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,930
It's quite a mess.

406
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,140
(She's new? They hired a divorced mom. Goodness.)

407
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,070
They only talked about her divorce
when this was a breaking news coverage.

408
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,170
Did you read that?

409
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,270
Did you?

410
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,710
She single-handedly embarrassed
every anchor at JBC.

411
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,980
Getting a divorce these days
isn't considered an embarrassment.

412
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,680
Then, should she be proud?

413
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,020
Images and reputations are
the most important for anchors.

414
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,760
When people hear her name, Jung Da-jung,

415
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,430
they'll only think about her divorce.

416
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,240
Whenever she's on TV, people only
talk about how she got a divorce.

417
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,340
Make her

418
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,570
keep a low profile.

419
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,310
Okay.

420
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,730
Ms. Kwon will be handling
your baseball interviews, Ms. Jung.

421
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,800
Pardon?

422
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,400
Me?

423
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,800
You'll start tomorrow.
Give her the materials.

424
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Sir, why am I being switched out
all of a sudden?

425
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,170
Did you think everything would go
smoothly after your divorce?

426
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,880
A public figure ought to be more careful.

427
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,740
Is a divorce

428
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,750
something I should be careful with?

429
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,820
Pardon?

430
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,650
Of course, it is.

431
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,230
You're an anchor. How can your personal
life stand out more than your reporting?

432
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,930
I don't want to hear your complaints.
If you're free,

433
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,170
go and clean up the storage.

434
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,970
Don't just stand there. Go!

435
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,080
(4th quarter's viewer rating record)

436
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,350
Okay. I understand.

437
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,260
Get back to work. Okay.

438
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,320
Hello?

439
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,690
(Hello, Ms. Jung. This is
Lee from "Culture Night".)

440
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,420
Hello, Ms. Lee. I got your script.

441
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,160
(Gosh, I'm sorry to bring bad news.)

442
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,400
(But I'm calling to tell you
that we won't be needing you anymore.)

443
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,360
I see. Okay.

444
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,240
Is it because of my divorce?

445
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,140
(Yes, we have to consider
the viewers' reaction to it.)

446
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,540
(I'm sorry.)

447
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,610
No. Goodbye, then.

448
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,430
(This stop is Korea District Heating
Corporation in Dongsan-dong.)

449
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,570
(The next stop is GT Square.)

450
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,940
(Bus)

451
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,080
- Gosh.
- He scared me.

452
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,080
Come on.

453
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,050
My gosh. I'm sorry.

454
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
Hey.

455
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,090
Can't you drive better than that?

456
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,860
Gosh. I'm sorry.

457
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,060
A motorcycle cut in front of
the bus out of nowhere.

458
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,030
So what?

459
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,900
If you're not a good driver, quit.

460
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,300
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,070
It's dangerous. Please take your seat.

462
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,110
If you're worried about my safety,
drive better.

463
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,870
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,440
(Why did you say it like that?)

465
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,280
Are you upset?

466
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,510
No. I must focus on driving.

467
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,580
Does that give you the right
to talk to me that way?

468
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,450
I asked you if you were upset.

469
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,520
- No.
- No, I bet you are. Darn it.

470
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,990
You...

471
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,290
What do you want?

472
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,630
Sit down.

473
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,430
Get your hand off me.

474
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
- Who are you to stop me?
- I don't need to answer that.

475
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,170
Don't make other passengers anxious
by picking a fight with the driver.

476
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,870
Just get off at the next stop quietly.

477
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,010
Gosh.

478
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,210
How old are you?

479
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Drivers are already stressed out

480
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,450
without any help from jerks like you.

481
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,080
Don't take out your anger on him!

482
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,650
- You little jerk.
- Just get off, man!

483
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,520
Let's just report him to the police.

484
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,720
Sir, just get off.

485
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,990
- That's enough.
- Come on.

486
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,490
- Don't you know the world we live in now?
- How can you threaten a driver now?

487
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,290
- What's wrong with you?
- You're inconveniencing everyone.

(Bus)

489
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,430
- Get off already.
- Get off now!

490
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,300
- Get off.
- Get off the bus!

491
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,500
- Gosh. Darn it.
- Get off the bus now.

492
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,110
Are you all right?

493
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,080
Thank you.

494
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,720
You're Si-woo's friend, right?

495
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,990
Yes.

496
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,040
Did you eat?

497
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,209
No.

498
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,740
Let's eat together.

499
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,789
I'm buying this meal to thank you
for helping me earlier. Eat a lot.

500
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,970
Isn't it hard working as a driver?

501
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,269
Making a living is supposed to be hard.

502
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,670
Everyone has a tough job.

503
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
Gosh.

504
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,450
Goodness. This shirt is
from my daughter-in-law.

505
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,189
Darn it.

506
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,570
I'm sorry, Father.

507
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,180
We

508
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,320
decided to get a divorce.

509
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,390
I'm sorry.

510
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,760
Don't apologize to me.

511
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,430
I know it was hard on you.

512
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,130
From now on,

513
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,300
you don't have to visit me to check on me.

514
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,450
(From Da-jung)
(Father, happy birthday.)

515
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,950
I told her not to send me presents.

516
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh, the kid paid for it on his way out.

517
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,700
(Gobiwoo Restaurant)

518
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,770
Hey.

519
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,170
A student doesn't have money.
Why did you pay?

520
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Here.

521
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,080
Please buy me something better next time.

522
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,350
Happy birthday.

523
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,020
How did you know it was my birthday?

524
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,460
I heard your daughter-in-law gave you that
as a gift.

525
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,930
Right.

526
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,230
My daughter-in-law is so kind.

527
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
She always gets me something
for my birthday.

528
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,770
Even though I told her
she didn't have to anymore.

529
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,680
Goodness.

530
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,530
(Messages)

531

(Father)

532
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,700
(Thanks for everything, Da-jung.)

533
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,010
Yes?

534
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,490
Do you have seaweed soup?

535
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,940
Here. Eat up.

536
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,910
Thank you for the meal.

537
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,180
How is it? Is it edible?

538
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,550
It's delicious.

539
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,860
Isn't it hard?

540
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,670
No, it's not.

541
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,870
I feel like I'm making you suffer.

542
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,840
I'm sorry.

543
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,780
It's all my fault.

544
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,290
No, it's not, Father.

545
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,060
I should get going.

546
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,190
Oh, right.
Use this for your living expenses.

547
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,860
It's okay, Father.

548
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Take it.

549
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,570
Don't tell Dae-young.

550
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,600
If he finds out I came,

551
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,040
he would definitely hate it. Bye, then.

552
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,710
Wait.

553
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,810
Don't come out.

554
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,150
(Hong Dae-young)

555
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,930
Hello?

556
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,230
I'm sorry I couldn't go to the courthouse.

557
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,730
Is that why you called?

558
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
I heard

559
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,970
you kept in contact with my father.

560
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,250
Why did you take care of him?

561
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,950
Because he's your parent.

562
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,690
My father said

563
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,130
mean things to you in the past.

564
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,030
But you're okay with it?

565
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,800
He apologized to me,

566
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,000
and you don't know this,

567
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,300
but he helped us a lot
when we were struggling.

568
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,670
- Da-jung...
- But

569
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,210
I can't take care of him anymore,

570
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,340
so you should do it from now on.

571
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
Goodbye.

572
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,860
Are you going home after meeting
with Si-woo?

573
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,090
Yes.

574
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,900
Did you forget your umbrella?

575
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Yes.

576
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,670
Then use this.

577
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,670
It's okay.

578
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,140
My house is close by.
You should take this.

579
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,540
Then let's go together.

580
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,510
I'll walk you home.

581
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,970
Thank you. Get home safely, Woo-young.

582
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,810
Thank you

583
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,750
for always caring.

584
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,320
Goodness. You don't have to thank me.

585
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,290
I don't think

586
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,830
I never thanked you properly.

587
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,510
Why are these here?

588
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,480
These are really expensive.

589
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,320
They are?

590
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,490
Yes. They just came out.

591
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,660
Gosh. I'm late.

592
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
I'm going to school.

593
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,700
Okay.

594
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,890
(Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung)

595
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,310
Goodness.
What brings you to call this morning?

596
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,940
The sneakers you gave me last time.

597
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,380
I think they're too expensive for me
to accept out of goodwill.

598
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,220
Gosh. I told you I don't need them.

599
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,480
Then I'll pay you for them.

600
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,590
No...

601
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,060
Okay.
Bring them to the baseball stadium later.

602
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,660
Okay. I'll see you later.

603
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,670
- Hey.
- Yes?

604
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,200
What time is your interview today?

605
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,870
It's at 3 p.m.

606
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,440
- 3 p.m.?
- Yes.

607
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,810
Okay.

608
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,410
Good work everyone.

609
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,980
- Great work.
- Thanks for your good work.

610
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,380
- Good work.
- Good work.

611
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,760
I thought Anchorwoman Jung
was coming today.

612
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,730
I'm doing the interviews from now on.

613
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,890
Why is that?

614
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,630
Since Da-jung's news on divorce,

615
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,630
she got on everyone's bad side at JBC.

616
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,940
Why did she have to get divorced
and lower her reputation like that?

617
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,510
Is that something that would
lower a person's reputation?

618
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,910
She probably had an issue
if she got divorced, don't you think?

619
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,410
News anchors are public figures too.

620
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,290
I'm a public figure,
so I know this quite well.

621
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,520
Reputations crumble

622
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,430
more easily by saying the wrong thing
than getting divorced.

623
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,590
Sorry?

624
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,100
To some people, 
getting divorced may be big news,

625
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,870
but to others, it's a big life decision.

626
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,270
(Ye Ji-hoon)

627
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,340
I'm just worried that when people
hear you say that,

628
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,240
it might hurt your reputation, you know.

629
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,650
Why is he defending her?

630
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,930
(May I know where the Teacher's Office
for grade 11 is?)

631
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,560
(The Teacher's Office for grade 11
is located on the 2nd floor.)

632
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,640
You can speak in sign language too?

633
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,780
Just a little.

634
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,280
You can really do everything.

635
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,380
It's nothing.

636
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,750
- Woo-young,
- Yes?

637
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,850
I have to study for the skills assessment,
so I don't think I can practice tonight.

638
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,150
Skills assessment?

639
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,090
Yes, the math skills assessment is due
tomorrow.

640
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,720
Did you not do it yet?

641
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,930
I should work on that.

642
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,030
You didn't do it?

643
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,070
Do you want to work on it together
at my house, then?

644
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,470
Sure, that sounds great!

645
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,900
Let's go.

646
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,740
You really didn't need to bring anything.

647
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,110
How can I?

648
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,580
Nobody in our family eats this.

649
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,690
Gosh, you don't know.

650
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,070
What are you doing?

651
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,600
Si-woo, you can study.

652
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,040
I'll do the dishes.

653
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,570
What?

654
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,510
It's fine. Study.

655
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,320
I'm home.

656
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,130
You're drinking again?

657
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,500
It's my day-off. Let me drink.

658
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,140
Why can't you clean up after yourself?

659
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,680
You think we have a cleaner or something?

660
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,410
Just leave it. I'll clean up after.

661
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,450
- When?
- After this.

662
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,880
Come on!

663
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,390
How much housework do you think you do?

664
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,550
I'd say

665
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,520
at least 50 percent.

666
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,960
No, more like 30 percent.

667
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,690
What? That's too little.

668
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,160
Seriously.

669
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,900
That's why you're losing!

670
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,910
How pathetic.
You didn't even do 30 percent.

671
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,180
Woo-young, aren't you going to work
on your assessment?

672
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,950
I'm fine. You can keep studying.

673
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,690
You're home.

674
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,660
What do you think you're doing here?

675
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,970
Woo-young is such a husband material.

676
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,900
Husband material? As if.

677
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,370
You think it's normal to do dishes
at someone else's house?

678
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,970
Did you eat?

679
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,210
Why do you care?
You think you're my dad or something?

680
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,310
What?

681
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,950
Bo-bae, let's watch some TV
before we start on the assessment.

682
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,990
Sure!

683
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,090
It's Ji-hoon!

684
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,290
Ye Ji-hoon?

685
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,930
Amazing!

686
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,740
- That's our Ji-hoon.
- Yes, our Ji-hoon.

687
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,870
"Our" Ji-hoon?

688
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,240
He's an old man! And certainly not yours.

689
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:08,380
Who are you to have a say
on what I call him?

690
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,340
I'm...

691
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,250
(I'm your father!)

692
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,350
Goodness.

693
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,380
Whatever. Men who look like that

694
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,020
are the men you need to be careful of,
all right?

695
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,150
What did you just say?

696
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,130
(Mother-in-law)

697
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,670
Who is he to say that about our Ji-hoon?

698
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,370
Yes, Mother?

699
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,250
How could you get a divorce
without coming to me first?

700
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,480
You think you two can just decide on that
among yourselves?

701
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,350
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever. Where are you?

702
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,360
Well,

703
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,290
- I'm in Busan.
- Still?

704
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,890
I'm sorry.

705
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:04,130
Isn't it basic manner to apologize
in person?

706
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,570
I'm sorry.
I'll go and meet you soon, Mother.

707
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,770
Whatever. Bye.

708
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,680
Soon?

709
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
How am I going to apologize
with this face?

710
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,690
I can't do that.

711
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,830
Grandmother, you must be tired
from your long trip.

712
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,530
Why didn't you give a call before coming?

713
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,770
I just wanted to surprise
my grandchildren.

714
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,340
Goodness!

715
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,580
I'm sorry!

716
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,060
Woo-young, this is my grandmother.

717
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,630
Grandmother, he's my friend.

718
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,060
Is...

719
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,130
Is that right?

720
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,070
Hello, ma'am.

721
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,010
Si-woo, I'll get going first. Goodbye.

722
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,510
Si-a,

723
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,520
you have to be careful of men
who look like that.

724
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,690
What?

725
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,070
You're here.

726
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Everyone else went home.
You're working so hard.

727
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,010
I got bored while waiting for you.

728
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,050
I'm sorry for coming so late.

729
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,780
Are you okay?

730
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,220
Of course.

731
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,220
I'm all healed now.

732
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,130
Can you try those on?

733
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,960
- Sorry?
- Help me practice while you're here.

734
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,700
- Right now?
- You said that you owe me.

735
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,840
Put those on and come out.

736
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,340
Come on.

737
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,150
Da-jung, keep your eyes open,

738
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,350
and watch the ball all the way.

739
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,640
Does this really help with you practicing?

740
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,240
Of course. One more time!

741
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,550
Focus a little more.

742
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,050
Keep your feet grounded,

743
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,420
and relax your shoulders.

744
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,590
Relax.

745
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,190
Good.

746
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,980
You just got on the base.

747
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Doesn't it feel great?

748
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,690
I know that you gave me
an easy one on purpose.

749
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,390
You still hit it anyway.

750
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,760
Even if it's hard and frustrating,

751
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,660
when you keep at it,
you get to hit it once.

752
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,600
Yes.

753
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,670
Don't be scared
just because you got a strike.

754
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,300
You never know
if you'll hit the ball, get a ground ball,

755
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,710
or hit a home-run

756
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,170
before you swing your bat.

757
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,280
So you should keep swinging to the end.

758
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,180
Did Ms. Kwon talk to you about me?

759
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,150
Sort of.

760
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,090
I thought

761
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,120
everything would be perfect
once I became an anchor.

762
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,900
But working at a company isn't that easy.

763
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,160
After my divorce became a public record,

764
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,430
I lost all of my positions.

765
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,670
I'm trying to hang in there,

766
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,410
but I feel so bad for my kids.

767
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,180
Lately, I'm not sure
if I'm trying to achieve my dream

768
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,410
or if I'm being too ambitious.

769
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,820
I can't tell now.

770
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,820
What's so bad about being ambitious?

771
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,590
Ever since I decided
to become a ball player,

772
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,790
I've always been ambitious.

773
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,030
Really? You?

774
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,430
When other players got ahead of me

775
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,860
although I thought I was better,

776
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,300
I couldn't go to sleep that night
out of anger.

777
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,430
I would practice too much, get injured,

778
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,200
and inconvenience other people.

779
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,640
But

780
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,810
there were people who believed
in me to the end.

781
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,750
So you should aim high.

782
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,620
Your family will root for you.

783
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,390
Thank you.

784
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,060
Don't mention it. I'm your number one fan.

785
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,860
What?

786
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,700
(I became your fan after seeing
how confident and brave you are.)

787
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,900
(I hope there are only sunshine
and rainbows in your future.)

788
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,470
(From your number one fan.)

789
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,340
Ms. Jung.
There's something I want to tell you.

790
00:58:58,910 --> 00:58:59,980
Excuse me.

791
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,420
Hello?

792
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,660
What?

793
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,730
She might come home.
You should stay at home.

794
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,860
I'll look for her.

795
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,230
I'm sorry. I have to get going now.

796
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,770
What happened?

797
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,030
My daughter went missing.

798
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,140
Your daughter?

799
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
See you later.

800
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,490
(- This is the police.)
- Hello?

801
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,520
(Is this the guardian of Ye Seo-yeon?)

802
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:40,690
The police?

803
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,170
- Mr. Kim.
- Hello, sir.

804
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,670
Go home. You won't get anything tonight.

805
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,440
Okay.

806
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,210
Let me use the restroom.

807
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,150
Seo-yeon!

808
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,020
Are you okay?

809
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:14,890
Are you hurt?

810
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,330
Why did you leave without telling us?

811
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,660
Isn't that Ye Ji-hoon?

812
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,400
- I think he is.
- Right?

813
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,130
We found her in front of Mirae Hospital.

814
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,870
She was crying there with this photo.

815
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,370
Do you know who she is?

816
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,540
It's her mother.

817
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,610
But what's your relationship
to this child?

818
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,750
I am her father.

819
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,320
What?

820
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,880
Her father?

821
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,790
Are you okay? Don't cry.

822
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,120
It's all right.

(Trustworthy Seoul Police)

825
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,930
- What's that?
- He had a daughter?

826
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,470
- That's Ye Ji-hoon.
- Gosh.

827
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:34,900
("Baseball Player Ye Ji-hoon Has a Daughter")
- What?
- Who is that?

828
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,740
- He has a daughter?
- He really has a daughter?

829
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,070
- No way.
- That makes no sense.

830
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,870
- I'm his fan too.
- What a shocker.

831
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,510
- I'm so disappointed.
- Hey.

832
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,010
- How did he hide that?
- Unbelievable.

833
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,380
(A lot of baseball fans are shocked
to find out that a baseball player,)

(at Gangpo Police Station while)

837
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,220
(- carrying a girl in his arms.)
- I didn't know he had a daughter.

838
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,590
(- According to the police,)
- Hey, honey.

- You'll be late. Go.

(- as her father.)
- Okay.

- Okay.

(They are focusing on finding out the mother.)

846
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,650
Gosh. Ye Ji-hoon hit a big one.

847
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,520
Gosh. I knew this would happen.

848
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,720
In a way, it's amazing.
How did he hide that he had a daughter?

849
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:27,890
Right.

850
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,730
(Mr. Ye, are you okay?)

851
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,770
(I was just worried.)

852
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,640
(I'm worried about you and your daughter.)

853
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:43,970
(Hang in there.)

Hey, Da-jung.
Can we meet after you get off work?

859
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,600
Ms. Ok.

860
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Hello.

861
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,470
Why don't we go together?
Let me give you a ride.

862
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,940
Thank you, but I like walking.

863
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,100
I see.

864
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,670
- Bye.
- Bye.

865
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,980
She must think she's a queen or something.

866
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,150
Ms. Ok.

867
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,220
Gosh.

868
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,520
Hello, Mr. Go.

869
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:12,190
What brings you here?

870
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,760
I need to talk to you.

871
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,960
Let's talk about it in my car.

872
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,600
Don't tell me that's the car.

873
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,310
Of course, not.

874
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,180
Let's talk over there.

875
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:31,710
Okay.

876
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,950
Abort the limo.

877
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,520
Abort the limo!

878
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:48,030
What's going on with them?

879
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,470
What is this about?

880
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,600
I'm officially asking you out.

881
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:57,270
I'm sorry,
but I'll officially turn it down.

882
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,870
Why is that? Why are you turning it down?

883
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,180
If you give me a reasonable answer,

884
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,680
I'll give up.

885
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,080
If you have a boyfriend--

886
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,720
I do have a boyfriend.

887
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,020
- Come on. You're lying, right?
- No.

888
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,250
You're lying.

889
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,050
Why? Do I look like
I can't have a boyfriend?

890
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,590
- No. You look like you do.
- That's right.

891
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,060
Bye.

892
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:22,760
Gosh. I should've said the opposite.

893
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,200
- Ms. Ok.
- Hey, Deok-jin.

894
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,840
Come on. You should at least
say hello to your friend.

895
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,340
From afar, it looked like

896
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,080
you were talking to my Hye-in.

897
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,880
"My Hye-in"?

898
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,320
Gosh. I slipped.

899
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,620
It's a secret.

900
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,420
I'm only telling you this
because you're my friend.

901
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,330
I'm dating her.

902
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,430
What?

903
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,130
She doesn't want people to find out
that we're dating since we're colleagues.

904
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,670
Don't tell anyone.
It's strictly for your ears only.

905
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,340
Okay.

906
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,860
Why did you want to see me?

907
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,690
What? I...

908
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,730
Well,

909
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,200
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

910
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,700
Okay. What is it?

911
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:36,140
I know this woman in her 30s.

912
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,140
You know,

913
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,510
she keeps telling me that she gets
butterflies for a high school student.

914
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,380
She can't stop thinking about him.

915
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,150
And her heart pounds like crazy.

916
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,280
What a nutcase.

917
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,820
What?

918
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,320
But she's unmarried.

919
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:55,960
That's not important right now.

920
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,130
She likes a minor.

921
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:00,130
Gosh, that's so disgusting.

922
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,670
Did you say, "disgusting"?

923
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,770
Yes, it is.

924
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,970
Imagine she liked my son.

925
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:14,710
(Ye Ji-hoon)

926
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,010
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

927
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,120
Gosh. Come on.

928
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,800
Hi, Mr. Ye.

929
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,260
I read your message.

930
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,500
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

931
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,970
Are you okay?

932
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,670
Can we meet now?

933
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,440
Now?

934
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,890
Hey.

935
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:11,270
Dae-young.

936
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:13,699
Ms. Ok's boyfriend

937
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,170
is Choi Il-kwon.

938
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,840
What? Choi Il-kwon?

939
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:22,010
What am I going to do?

940
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,650
Hey, it's all right.

941
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,720
You never had a chance with her anyway.

942
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,980
What? Hong Dae-young.

943
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,250
How can my own friend say that to me?

944
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,460
Hong Dae-young?

945
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:43,529
I should have been the one
who got younger, not you.

946
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,000
Why do you only get lucky like that?

947
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,230
Darn you.

948
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,900
Do you think this is good for me?

949
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,770
I can't even tell Da-jung who I am.

950
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,980
All I can do is hover around her.

951
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,250
Hong Dae-young.

952
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,850
Can you drink with me tonight?

953
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:05,390
Woo-young,

954
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:08,690
you're Hong Dae-young?

955
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,970
Have I truly gone mad now?

956
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,400
Ae-rin, that's not it.

957
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,070
"Ae-rin"?

958
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:28,079
Well, that's not it, Ms. Chu.

959
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,909
Goodness.

960
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,650
I didn't know you two were here.

961
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:45,790
I'm sorry, Ae-rin. I have to get going.
I have somewhere to be.

962
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,830
What? Hold on.

963
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,500
It sounds like it's urgent.
You should go, Da-jung.

964
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,900
Yes. You should hurry.

965
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:54,430
I mean, bye.

966
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:56,770
Okay. See you later.

967
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,310
Wait, Da-jung.

968
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,110
Yes?

969
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,280
I have

970
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,520
something to tell you.

971
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,540
(Epilogue)

972
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,140
Are you here to buy a present?

973
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,180
Yes. Do you also deliver?

974
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:38,510
Of course.

975
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,580
I want this pair in 240mm.

976
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:41,980
Sure.

977
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,360
(I became your fan
after seeing how confident and brave you are.)

978
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,060
(I hope there are only sunshine
and rainbows in your future.)

979
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,690
(From your number one fan.)

980
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,260
Your number one fan.
I wonder who sent them to you.

981
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,830
I'm so jealous.

982
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,830
(There are things you want to give)

983
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,140
(even if it's impossible.)

984
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,310
(In hindsight,)

985
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,980
(they weren't that grand.)

986
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:20,850
Who changed the light?

987
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,770
Who washed the dishes?

988
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,150
Who bought them?

989
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,160
(They were so small and insignificant.)

990
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,230
(You considered them to be unimportant.)

991
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,100
(But these small things make you smile.)

992
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,570
(I finally realized that.)

993
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:21,620
- You're home.
- Mom.

994
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,150
My gosh, Da-jung.
It was a tough day, wasn't it?

995
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,360
It was you.

996
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,230
Thank you, Mom.

997
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:38,170
(It's impossible to share
my sincere feelings as it is too late.)

998
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:41,500
(But)

999
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:43,840
(I'll be okay)

1000
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,380
(as long as it makes you smile.)
