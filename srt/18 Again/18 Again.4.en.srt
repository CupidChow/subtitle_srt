(All women also have their first love.)

4
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,189
Why are you giving me this?

5
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,390
Why do you think?

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,560
It's because I like you.

7
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,970
Thank you, Ae-rin.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,870
But I can't accept this.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,170
- Why not?
- I'll be on the national basketball team.

10
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,210
Every second counts for me.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,610
I can't date girls now.

12
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,310
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,020
(He chose basketball over me.)

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,560
(But I even loved his passion for his dream.)

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,890
(I'll wait for you, Dae-young.)

16
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,860
Yes!

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,100
Well done.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
What is this?

19
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,670
He said he didn't have time to date.

20
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,310
(I'll wait for you, Dae-young.)

21

Are you the transfer student,
Jung Da-jung?

22
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,890
Yes.

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,030
Come out.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,440
You'd better know your place now.

25
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,240
I'll stop here for today.

26
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,279
But you'd better watch your back.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,450
Let's go.

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,290
- Ae-rin!
- Are you okay?

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,320
Let go of me.

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,390
- Let go of me.
- Let's go.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,390
- I told you to behave.
- It was there, right?

32
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,930
- It's not that...
- You've gotten quite bold, haven't you?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's take her bag.

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,830
- No. Hold on.
- Let go of it.

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,970
- Hey.
- What are you looking at?

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,170
- Are you looking down on us?
- No.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,440
We're not finished talking.

39
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,110
- Do you think this is a joke?
- Please, stop.

40
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,640
- Give it to me.
- That's right.

41

Hello, everyone.

42

- Who are you?
- I'm...

43
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,020
- What's this?
- Safety equipment.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Hold tight.

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,190
Hey, run!

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,360
Hey!

47

Over here.

50

Those girls won't leave you alone.

51
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,110
Tell them to come at me. I'm not afraid

Oh, right. My backpack.

53

Darn.

55

Are you afraid of your mom?

Yes.

If Da-jung's beauty is the best in the district,

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,550
I'll visit you soon.

169
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,270
"I heard that JBC chose people based on their skills,"

170
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,000
"but I guess they like old ladies."

171
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,210
"I'm going to change the channel if that lady comes on."

172
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,610
"Tell the director to come out."

173
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,450
Director.

174
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,050
At least it got a lot of views.

175
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,280
That's the problem!

176
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,820
What good does it bring to JBC

177
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,050
to have a video like this go viral?

178
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

179
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,190
At least you know.

180
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,600
Let me say this again.

181
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,870
Make sure that old woman

182
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,810
can't last her probation period and walks out of here herself.

183
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,210
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,220
Don't you think the comments on Da-jung
are too malicious?

185
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,490
It's too bad.

186
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,830
She probably thought she'd become a star
from getting soaked,

187
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,230
but she's just getting hate comments.

188
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,400
This is why women must succeed
before they get old.

189
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,430
Once you get old,

190
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
people will leave hate comments
on whatever you do.

191
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,670
Ms. Kwon.

192
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Still,

193
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,610
hate comments are better than no comments.

194
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,580
Da-jung! We were so worried for you.

195
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,080
We feel really bad
about those hate comments.

196
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,820
You must be disheartened.

197
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,920
Disheartened? They all have a point.

198
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,890
Are you really okay?

199
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,460
What did the higher-ups say?

200
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,460
To restock the break room.

201
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,720
(JBC is also a victim.)

202
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,160
(How could they know she was a mother?)

203
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,990
(She should just stay home
and raise her kids.)

204
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,890
(Who does she think she is?
I don't like her at all.)

205
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,730
(Isn't she the best mother ever
if she can do well at her job,)

206
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,100
(and raise her kids well?)

207
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,530
Si-a?

208
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,070
(I feel bad for the kids.)

209
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,010
(I would hate to have a mom like her.)

210
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,340
(Who are you to act like a saint?)

211
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,810
(Just worry about your own life.)

212
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
(It's so shameless of you
to come on TV as if nothing happened.)

213
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,980
(She took responsibility for it.)

214
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,680
(I thought that was rather inspiring.)

215
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,420
Could this be Si-a?

216
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,060
(Si-a and Si-woo, are you two okay?)

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,860
(Is everything okay at school?)

218
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,900
Did you see his mom's video?

219
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,000
I'd be so embarrassed if it were my mom.

220
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,440
Did you see the clip?

221
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,510
- It's his mom.
- Someone so lowly doesn't belong here.

222
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,940
If it were me, I'd be too embarrassed
to come to school.

223
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,410
Exactly. Unbelievable.

224
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,120
(Si-woo)
(It's all good.)

225
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,220
He's lying.

226
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,030
(Si-a)
(Everything is fine.)

227
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,930
She's lying too.

228
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,510
Hey, Gu Ja-sung.

229
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,450
I heard about it all.

230
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,280
So what?

231
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm going to ignore it because it doesn't
even deserve to be heard.

232
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
But

233
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,490
I can't ignore you insulting my mom.

234
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,440
Why you little...

235
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,370
Run that mouth of yours again if you dare.

236
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,310
Hey!

237
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,580
And one more thing,

238
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,150
if you lay a finger on Si-woo again,

239
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,760
you and I will get into some real trouble.

240
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,090
(Kid, look at you all grown.
You can even cause trouble.)

241
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,460
Ice yourself with this.

242
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm fine.

243
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,870
Your mother will worry about you
if you go home

244
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,539
with a swollen face like that.

245
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,210
I'll do it.

246
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
(Are you okay?)

247
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,480
(Yes.)

248
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,040
(Come to the convenience store after.)

249
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,950
(All right.)

250
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,700
We're having a staff dinner tonight,

251
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,130
so wrap up whatever you're doing now.

252
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes, sir.

253
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,740
Mr. Heo, what's the dinner for?

254
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,840
You can skip it if you have a problem.

255
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,740
Of course not.

256
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,210
If you have something else,
you're allowed to miss it.

257
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,980
But Ms. Jung, you're required to attend,

258
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,220
so don't miss it.

259
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,220
- Sorry?
- What?

260
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,150
Yes, I will attend.

261
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Okay.

262
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,390
Why are you the only one
who's required to attend?

263
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,230
Maybe it's a staff dinner to console her.

264
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,730
I doubt it.

265
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,800
Sorry.

266
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,870
Throw the water!

267
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,380
Throw the water!

268
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,880
Throw the water!

269
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,720
Throw the water!

270
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,380
I guess this is what they called her for.

271
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,720
I knew it. They wouldn't console her.

272
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,090
I thought this was an important dinner,

273
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,560
so I skipped my Chinese lesson for this.

274
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,500
Come on. She had a long day today.

275
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,970
Why don't we show her some support
as her colleagues?

276
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,740
Throw the water!

277
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,210
Throw the water!

278
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,550
I will never throw water
at another news anchor ever again!

279
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,290
Goodness.

280
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,720
I can't do it.

281
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,990
Come on.

282
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,530
Ms. Jung!

283
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,260
Can you imagine how bad he feels
right now?

284
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,300
Just accept the apology
by throwing some water

285
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,800
and be done with it.

286
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,770
Throw the water!

287
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,370
Throw the water!

288
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,410
Could we get it over with already?
I'm so embarrassed.

289
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,710
Throw the water!

290
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,280
- Throw the water!
- All right.

291
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,110
I'll do it now.

292
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,020
One,

293
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,920
two,

294
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,220
three!

295
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,890
Here you go.

296
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,960
Cheers to Seum!

297
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,750
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

298
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,550
Here you go.

299
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,920
Thank you for taking
my difficult request, sir.

300
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,920
It's nothing.

301
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,160
Because of that video,

302
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,660
we get so many complaint calls

303
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,760
at the team's office.

304
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,830
Ms. Jung, thank you for agreeing
to film the video.

305
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,100
- Here.
- It's no problem.

306
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,540
People are scrutinizing her for being old
and being a mother,

307
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,380
so this is a good chance for her
to make a good impression, too.

308
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,820
She's probably thankful
that you came up with this idea.

309
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Aren't you?

310
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,420
Yes, of course.

311
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,890
I'm so happy that I came here
to apologize,

312
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
but I also got a thank you!

313
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,160
If you're so thankful,

314
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,130
get us an exclusive interview
with Ye Ji-hoon.

315
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
Of course we will!

316
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,630
Do you think you can do it?

317
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,870
Sure. That sounds good.

318
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,340
Great.

319
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,170
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

320
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,850
Hey, Ms. Kwon?

321
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,420
- Yes, Director?
- Why are you sitting there?

322
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,050
Come and sit here.

323
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,450
Ms. Jung,

324
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,860
if you're done drinking, you can go.

325
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,360
Okay.

326
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Here.

327
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,540
Meet Ms. Kwon Yu-mi, who got hired at JBC

328
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,910
as the top candidate this season.

329
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,080
Introduce yourself.

330
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,180
Hello, I'm Kwon Yu-mi,
and I'm a new news anchor at JBC.

331
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,510
Gosh, congratulations.

332
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,150
You're quite young.

333
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,250
Can I ask her how old she is?

334
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,450
I'm 24.

335
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,820
I see. No wonder.

336
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,590
She has great skin.

337
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,260
This time, Ms. Kwon here will do

338
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,130
the exclusive interview with Mr. Ye.

339
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,130
I plan to assign her for his interviews
from now on.

340
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,100
I thought it'd be nice
to get to know each other.

341
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,540
I see. That sounds nice.

342
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,770
You guys look nice together too.

343
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,640
Well,

344
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,650
I want Ms. Jung Da-jung
to do my interview.

345
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,190
Ms. Jung doesn't have
a good reputation now.

346
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,830
You won't benefit in any way
from getting mixed up with her.

347
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,530
That doesn't matter.

348
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,730
Instead of being interviewed by a mom,

349
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,370
you would look much better
being interviewed by a young lady.

350
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,540
Gosh, I'm getting old,

351
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,270
so I'm more comfortable around moms.

352
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,880
Please, sir.

353
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,180
My goodness. You're so funny.

354
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Then, let's settle that
Ms. Jung will do his next interview.

355
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,990
- Okay.
- Sure.

356
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,610
I guess it's bothering you a lot.

357
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,250
Kids are bound to stop.

358
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,850
Don't let them get to you.

359
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,720
How is that possible?

360
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,780
They were talking about my mom.

361
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,750
Are you worried about your mom?

362
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,720
If you are,

363
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,220
you should call her.

364
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,930
It'll make me cringe.
What will I say to her?

365
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,130
You know,

366
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,430
tell her you were worried
and ask her if she's okay.

367
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Gosh.

368
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,300
Look at you.

369
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,240
For parents, hearing such words gives
comfort to parents when things are tough.

370
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,010
Gosh. Whatever.

371
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,710
I'm leaving if you don't want
to play basketball.

372
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,730
(Mom)

373
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,200
(Mom)

374
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,880
Hey, Si-woo.

375
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,810
What's wrong?

376
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,580
Nothing.

377
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,920
Nothing what?
Tell me if you need anything.

378
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,720
That's not the reason why I called.

379
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,820
I was wondering if you were okay.

380
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,990
What?

381
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,800
Did you call
because you were worried about me?

382
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,100
Gosh, it's nothing like that.

383
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,470
Come on. I know that's why you called.

384
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,400
If you know that,

385
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,740
don't make me worry.

386
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,710
Okay.

387
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:37,780
But a phone call from you
definitely got my spirits up.

388
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,280
When are you coming home?

389
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,950
I'm sorry. I'll be home late today.
Go to bed early.

390
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,090
(Okay.)

391
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,760
Come home safely.

392
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,490
Okay. Thank you.

393
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,400
Your son has a big heart.

394
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,430
My gosh. Did you hear that?

395
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,300
I'm sorry.

396
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,740
You know, I have good hearing.

397
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,010
You don't have to apologize.
You're embarrassing me.

398
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,640
You started it.

399
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,850
By the way,
do you really want me to interview you?

400
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,950
Then do you think I lied
that I was getting old for no reason?

401
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,620
Obviously, I'm still young.

402
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,450
Thank you.

403
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,320
You called yourself old
to help a middle-aged woman.

404
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,890
If you're thanking me, I'll take that.

405
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,330
But

406
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,860
is that all?

407
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,930
But that will be the end.

408
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,270
I am grateful,
but I can take care of myself.

409
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,310
I can take care of myself.

410
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,610
So don't do that next time.

411
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,620
Come here.

412
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,900
Hey, are you crying again?

413
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,540
I went to the zoo yesterday with my dad
and saw elephants.

414
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,580
But you didn't see them.

415
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,840
You don't have a dad
who will take you to the zoo.

416
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,710
♪You don't have a dad♪

417
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,850
Hey!

418
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,720
Stop bullying Ji-ho.

419
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,790
Si-a, who are you to stop us?

420
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,060
Are you his mom?

421
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,230
Or are you his girlfriend?

422
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,770
I told you I wouldn't let it slide
if you picked on him again.

423
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,170
Let's go.

424
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,610
He doesn't have a dad,
so that's what I said.

425
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,410
Why did you hit me, you brat?

426
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,380
Are you serious? You're dead meat.

427
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,120
You little...

428
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,950
Let go of me. Stop it!

429
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,630
Are you happy?

430
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,930
You got punched in the face.

431
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,130
Gosh.

432
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,640
I suddenly remembered when we were little.

433
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,040
You used to beat kids up
because you wanted to help me.

434
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,010
I didn't beat up anyone.

435
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,710
Do you not really remember anything?

436
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,780
You were so scary.

437
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Whatever.

438
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,090
(Healthy Boxed Meal)

439
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,230
Si-a, did you eat?

440
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
- No.
- Really?

441
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,900
Hello.

442
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Go Woo-young?

443
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,210
Do you move all these boxes by yourself?

444
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,450
Isn't it hard?

445
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,680
Not at all.

446
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,280
Si-a.

447
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,220
What?

448
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,250
(You're a student. If you need money,
ask your parents.)

449
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,990
(Why are you trying
to make money already?)

450
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
What is it?

451
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,460
(Let's be her friend. Be her friend.)

452
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,000
You

453
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,730
don't need money
because you're in trouble, right?

454
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,070
Are you serious?

455
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,000
What trouble would I be in?

456
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,140
So you're not, right?

457
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,070
That's all I need to hear.

458
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,680
Hello.

459
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Hey. You're here too, Ji-ho.

460
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,550
Is that your meal?
Want me to buy it for you?

461
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,860
No, I'm good.

462
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,970
Okay. "Healthy Boxed Meal".

Do you need a bag?

464
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,010
It's yours.

465
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,520
I don't know why you're working here,
but don't skip your meals.

466
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,020
Go straight home when you finish. Okay?

Hey, Woo-young!

(Healthy Boxed Meal)

Must I try to make nice
with your teacher for your sake?

471
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,110
If you mark my reputation again,

472
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,150
you won't be able to play basketball.

473
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,670
- I'm leaving.
- Let me go with you.

474
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,080
Yu-mi, you know
that I'm counting on you, right?

475
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,210
Yes. I'll do a good job.

476
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,350
Drink up.

477
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,620
Gosh. Bottoms up. Drink it up.

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,790
You can hold your liquor.
Why don't you drink one more glass?

- Gosh.
- Here.

480

Let's drink it up.

Gosh, those men.

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,100
Goodness.
Director Moon and the general manager

483
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,400
seem like they are having a blast.

484
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,870
What was that?

485
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,310
Are you ruining the mood?

486
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,650
Don't you know that a mom is
the best at lightening up the mood?

487
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,180
Goodness, I can't believe this woman.

488
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,090
All right. Let's get this party started.

489
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,370
You're not making a real bomb, right?

490
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,810
That's amazing.

491
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,280
If you think it's amazing, drink up.

492
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,110
Here. Drink up.

493
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,550
- Okay. Drink up.
- Okay!

494
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,580
Let's go!

495
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,590
Drink up!

496
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,500
This is amazing.

497
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,070
One more!

498
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,600
Give me another glass.

499
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,270
Let's go!

500
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,680
- Oh, my.
- This is great!

501
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,240
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

502
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,250
She really does know
how to take care of herself.

503
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,770
Be careful.

504
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Right.

505
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,970
Goodness.

506
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,109

508
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,140
Sir, your taxi's here.

509
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,879
Get in.

510
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,680
What is this?

511
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,950
- You said you wanted to drink more.
- I would love to,

512
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,290
but your wife keeps calling.
Should I pick up?

513
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,990
No, don't.

514
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,460
That's too bad.

515
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,030
Then drink this and sober up
as you go home.

516
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,359
Oh, my.

517
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,430
You're so sensible.

518
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,669
Goodbye. I won't go far.

519
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,169
You're so cool, Ms. Jung!

520
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,140
I love you!

521
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,379
I love you!

522
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,089
You were drinking quite a lot.
Are you okay?

523
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,060
Why wouldn't I be?

524
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,530
I don't think you are.

525
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,230
Pardon?

526
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,140
(Life starts with meat
and ends with meat.)

527
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,230
Was I wrong to take it off?

528
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,100
when you wore it out on purpose?

529
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,610
How cute.

530
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,610
Pardon? I'm cute?

531
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,050
Not you, this

532

533

536
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,530
Yes.

537
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,560
It's

538
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,470
my favorite character.

539

540
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
Pardon?

541

before an interview.

542

Aren't you Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung?

559
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,190
Oh, right.

560
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,530
You must've had a drink.

561
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,930

564
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,970
Why are you acting so stuck-up?

565
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,600
We said we'd treat you.

566
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,570

567
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,210
Did you hit me?

568

You seem very drunk. You should go home.

569

What? Are you looking down on me?

570

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,360

574
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,400
a bit of a temper.

575
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,700
I warned you.

576
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,670
Warn? Okay.

577
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,370

578
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,940

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,000

Woo-young. Stop.

Hey. Did you see him hit me?

586
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,520
Call the police.

587
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,590
Okay.

588
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,990
Go ahead.

589
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,300
I'll sue you for sexual harassment too.

590
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,700
Do you see that security camera?

591
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,140
I hear security cameras these days
even record sound.

592
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,880
Can a public figure be like this?

593
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,310
It'll be even better.

594
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,280
Since I'm a public figure,
it'll be on the news.

595
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,750
Then your faces will appear on the news.

596
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,650
Will you be able to face your family?

597
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,520
Go ahead.

598
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,260

602
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,440
Are you okay?

603
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,440
Yes, I'm fine.

604
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,950
I told you I could go alone.

605
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,190
Those guys could show up again.

606
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,700
What are you doing here at this hour?

607
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,300
I came to meet someone.

608
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,430
So did you meet them?

609
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,470
Yes, I did.

610
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,970
Is that so?

611
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,710
But still, don't stay out too late.

612
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,880
What? Didn't you see earlier?

613
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,850
There are a lot of strange people
out at night.

614
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,080
Gosh. Didn't you see me

615
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,250
scare those strange men away earlier?

616
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,520
We're here.

I'll get you a taxi.

It's fine. I'm not a kid.

If you're not a kid,

620

then I'm not a middle-aged woman.

That's not it.

622

I can call a taxi on my own.

623
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
You should go in.

624
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,640
Okay. Get home safely.

625
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980

626
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,890
What?

627
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,060
It was hard to achieve your dream.

628
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,860
so you shouldn't get hindered by
things like this.

629
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,560
Don't worry about Si-a and Si-woo,

630
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,330
and focus on your work.

636
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,450
People who are saying that you messed up
because you got pregnant in school

637
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,390
are just saying that
because it's not their business.

638
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,230
I think you're amazing

639
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,430
for being responsible.

640
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,700
It's

641
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,540
really nothing amazing.

that my kids are my mistakes.

644
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,520
I think they're my blessings.

645
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,120
I must be drunk.

646
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,390
I can't believe I'm saying this to a kid.

647
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,020
Go home now, Woo-young.

648
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,560
I actually...

649
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,130

I appreciate that you're concerned for me.

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,260
Where's Ms. Jung?

666
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,560
Ms. Jung is

667
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,160
interviewing Ye Ji-hoon right now,

668
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,370
the one that Yu-mi was supposed to do.

669
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,570
I don't know if he just has weird taste,

670
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,900
or if Ms. Jung is clever.

671
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,740
She's very clever, indeed.

672
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,840
Ms. Lim is right.

673
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,680
You may get excited to get casting offers,

674
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,950
but that's all a fleeting moment.

675
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,080
Don't loosen up and end up having
all of your shows stolen.

676
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,090
Protect what you have.

677
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,300
We'll start recording now.

678
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,230
Standby. Cue!

679
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,770
Welcome to
"Baseball Hot Star Hot Interview".

680
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,040
I have Seum's hero, Ye Ji-hoon,
with me here today.

681
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,380
Hello.

682
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,410
Hello, I'm Ye Ji-hoon.

683
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,310
You're once again

684
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,320
setting a record number of wins
this season.

685
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,250
What's the secret
to your consistent success?

686
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,420
I don't think there are any secrets...

687
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,200
I know!

688
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,000
I don't let things hurt,

689
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,440
or shake me up.

690
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,210
I think that's the secret
to continue doing well.

691
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,940
The best pitcher is different, indeed.

692
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,310
I'll move into the next question.

693
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Hi. Oh, right, Ji-ho?

694
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,290
- Yes?
- Who's on weekly class duties?

695
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,060
It's Si-a and Bo-bae.

696
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,820
Si-a and Bo-bae? I see.

697
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,930
Tell them to draw
the dodgeball court lines nicely.

698
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,290
Yes, sir.

699
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,110
Are you zoning out?

700
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,120
Goodness.

701
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,100
All right, huddle up. Let's start class.

702
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,170
Let's go.

703
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,210
- Is everyone here?
- Si-a!

704
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,320
What's wrong?

705
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,790
Si-a!

706
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,020
Si-a! Are you okay? Wake up.

707
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,260
- Hong Si-a!
- What's wrong?

708
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,820
- Where's my phone?
- Si-a! Wake up.

709
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,030
I'm going to call 911.

710
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,260
What do you think you're doing?

711
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,770
It's faster to run to the hospital
right by the school!

712
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,600
You guys go ahead and play dodgeball.

713
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,170
Ji-ho, stay here.

714
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,650
Thank you so much for making time
for the interview today.

715
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,720
That concludes today's
"Baseball Hot Star Hot Interview".

716
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,790
Cut!

717
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,560
- Good work.
- Good job.

718
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,930
That was amazing!

719
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,130
Watch this.

720
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,430
Did you see?

721
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,500
- That's amazing.
- Oh my gosh.

722
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,100
- He just caught it like that.
- He's so cool.

723
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,700
- It's incredible.
- How did he do that?

724
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,870
Are you leaving now?

725
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,040
Yes.

726
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,540
Are you really okay?

727
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,110
I'm fine.

728
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,110
This is nothing.

729
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,550
That's good to hear. I thought...

730
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,750
Excuse me.

731
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,390
Il-kwon, what's up?

732
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,560
What? Si-a is at the hospital?

733
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,930
Okay. I'll head there now.

734
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,860
Is something wrong?

735
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,470
My daughter is ill.

736
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,230
- I have to get going.
- Wait--

737
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,940
She usually never gets nervous,

738
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,610
but she seems nervous now. I'm worried.

739
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,910
It's a stomach spasm caused by stress.

740
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,850
You don't have to be worried.

741
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,150
It'll be fine as long as she de-stresses
and gets some good rest.

742
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,560
She can leave after the IV drip is done.

743
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,220
Okay. Thank you.

744
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,360
Thank you.

745
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,600
Woo-young, I'm just going to go
and make a call.

746
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,770
Okay. Go ahead.

747
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,320
It hurts!

748
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,490
It hurts!

749
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,330
Goodness.

750
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,300
I know what that feels like.

751
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,270
(Emergency Medical Center)

752
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,650
Si-a, Daddy is sorry.

753
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,550
It'll be over soon.

754
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,990
Just hold on, Si-a.

755
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,990
Si-a!

756
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,930
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm so sorry. Just hold on a little bit.

758
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,410
I'm sorry.

759
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,470
I'm sorry, Si-a.

760
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,320
Kid, you grew so much.

761
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,750
You're too young to be so stressed.

762
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,700
- What are you doing?
- You're awake!

763
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,800
I asked what you were doing.

764
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,270
Why are you here, caressing my hair?

765
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,610
Because I carried you all the way here
on my back.

766
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,650
Don't you remember?

767
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,990
Then you should've left
after dropping me off.

768
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,420
How dare you touch me?
Do you have a death wish?

769
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,500
You better be like this
to every other guy.

770
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,670
Understood?

771
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,870
Whatever.

772
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,840
Gosh.

773
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,280
- Deok-jin.
- Yes?

774
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,780
What's the age limit
for your daughter-in-law?

775
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,090
My daughter-in-law?
She just can't be my age.

776
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,130
Hey, son.

777
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,400
Is that so?
Until when must Si-a stay at the hospital?

778
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,040
Si-a is at the hospital? Why?

779
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,280
She had a stomach spasm.

780
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,010
Okay. Then you take good care of--

781
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,280
(Si-a, are you awake?)

782
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,950
(- Are you okay?)
- Wait.

783
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,220
Is that Ms. Ok?

784
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,650
Do you want to rest a bit more?

785
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,590
Yes. She's here.

786
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,560
Wait there. I'm on my way.

787
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,700
Is this the flower shop?

788
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,130
Woo-young is at the hospital?

789
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,900
Deok-jin, wait up!

790
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,670
You don't look too good.

791
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,310
Does it still hurt?

792
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,480
No. I'm all right now.

793
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,820
(I'm covering your shift.)

794
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,490
(Don't worry. Rest up.)

795
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,390
(I'm covering your shift.
Don't worry. Rest up.)

796
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,560
(Thank you. I'll treat you
to a nice meal next time.)

797
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,530
Hello.

798
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,930
- Why are you here?
- I can ask you the same thing.

799
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,140
Are you looking for Si-a?

800
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,040
Are you insane?

801
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,380
Ring it up.

802
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,710
(Emergency Ward)

803
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,770
Si-a!

804
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,080
Si-a, how did this happen?

805
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,980
You poor thing. It must have hurt so much.

806
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,320
By the way, where's Ms. Ok?
She should witness my warmheartedness.

807
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,060
That explains your behavior.

808
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,560
Gosh.

809
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,030
Goodness.

810
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,800
You're an adult. Act like one.

811
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,070
Si-a, did it hurt a lot?

812
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,770
Are you all right now?

813
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,780
Yes, I'm okay.

814
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,140
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

815
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,710
I heard you were very helpful, Woo-young.

816
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,980
I heard everything.

817
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,580
You practically flew with her on your back.

818
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,550
You might not have guessed it, but she has thick bones. Is your back okay?

819
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,150
Yes.

820
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,190
You should drink this.

821
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:21,460
It must have been hard bringing her here. You need to regain your energy.

822
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,160
By the way, you did come here to see me, right?

823
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Of course.

824
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,470
- You should drink one too.
- No!

825
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,840
She has a stomach spasm,
so she can't have juice yet.

826
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,670
Gosh. Then, I'll drink it.

827
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,280
Why did you bring flowers?

828
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,180
Nice. They look beautiful.

829
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,520
Don't touch them.

830
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,650
They are for Ms. Ok.
I don't need your bad luck.

831
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,060
Aren't they for Si-a?

832
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,030
Si-a.

833
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,330
Don't covet these flowers.

834
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,500
Goodness.

835
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,370
- Be good.
- Si-a. Are you okay?

836
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,670
Gosh, I'm okay.

837
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,510
Did you leave work because of me?

838
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,510
I finished my interview.

839
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,420
You must have been in pain earlier.
Why didn't you tell me?

840
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,390
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

841
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,620
And you're working too.

842
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,990
Is that important?

843
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,060
If you were sick, you should have told me.

844
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,260
You're upsetting me.

845
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,530
I'm really okay.

846
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,160
I can get discharged
once the drip is done.

847
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,460
But still. You'd better not keep things
from me again for my sake.

848
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,370
Gosh. Okay.

849
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,040
By the way,

850
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,610
how did you all get here?

851
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,010
Well,

852
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,210
I had to come and check on her
when I heard she was sick.

853
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,080
Are you okay? All right.

854
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,120
Woo-young, you can leave now.
My mom is here.

855
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,920
He can't leave.

856
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,990
You know what I mean?

857
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:02,730
He carried her on his back
all the way to the ER here

858
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,000
and stayed with her.

859
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,300
You can't tell him to leave like this.

860
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,500
Really?

861
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,670
Thank you, Woo-young.

862
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,140
This was nothing.

863
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,440
You're humble too.

864
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,680
Deok-jin, you raised a great son.

865
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,820
Why don't we

866
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,720
become in-laws?

867
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,380
(Emergency Medical Center)

868
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:03,660
(Lobby, Registration and Billing)

869
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,800
I'd like to pay the bill for Hong Si-a.

870
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,460
Okay. Hold on.

871
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,300
Everything has already been paid for her.

872
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,370
What?

873
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,610
That can't be right.

874
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,980
(Da-jung, I already paid for Si-a's medical bill.)

875
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,350
(Don't worry about it.)

876
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,990
(You must have been scared. Rest up.)

877
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,060
Hey, I like that pass.

878
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,490
That's it. Yes.

879
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,230
Let's do our best today. Let's go!

880
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,070
He's making me feel uncomfortable.

881

(Proof of Resignation, Name: Hong Dae-young)

882
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,300
Hey.

883
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,210
Where are you now?

884
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,140
Well, I'm in Busan.

885
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,980
I told you I'm on a business trip.

886
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,050
A business trip?

887
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,050
(Si-a is sick.)

888
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,960
(She has a stomach spasm. She's in the hospital now.)

889
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,330
I see. A stomach spasm.

890
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,360
"I see. A stomach spasm"?

891
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,000
Aren't you worried?

892
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,970
No, a lot of my colleagues
had stomach spasms.

893
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,300
I know a thing or two about it.

894
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,840
Once she stops getting stressed

895
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,300
and is well-rested, it will go away.
Don't worry.

896
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,770
Hey, Dae-young. Your daughter is sick.

897
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,080
Instead of asking me where she is
and telling me you'd be here,

898
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,380
(you're telling me she'll be okay
with rest and not to worry?)

899
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,950
How can you call yourself her dad?

900
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,620
Da-jung, you don't know everything.

901
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,090
No, that's not true. I know too well.

902
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,520
(Whenever we had problems,
you said you were busy and tired.)

903
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,160
(Giving me excuses and avoiding them
were your specialty.)

904
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,190
You were

905
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,330
never here for us when we needed you.

906
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,630
Is that what you think of me?

907
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,070
Don't worry. From now on,

908
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,670
we won't need you anymore.

909
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,360
I wasn't there when they needed me?

910
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,330
Let's see if you can

911
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,960
still say that after finding out who I am.

912
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,940
When did you get here?

913
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,980
If you're upset, just cry.

914
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,610
If you bottle it up, it will snowball.

915
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,350
I'm all right.

916
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,950
I mean it. I'm fine.

917
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,050
Gosh.

918
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,290
Goodness. You always act tough.

919
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,930
Thank you for covering for me.

920
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,740
What made you so stressed out

921
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,470
that it made you pass out?

922
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,540
It's nothing.

923
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,240
I'm not stressed.

924
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,550
Si-a.

925
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,150
Whenever you had problems,

926
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,550
you always handled them by yourself.

927
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,760
Did that upset you?

928
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,390
Yes.

929
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,300
I can't solve your problems.

930
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,670
But I can listen to them.

931
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,870
So tell me if you have any problems.

932
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,520
You're right.
That's the right thing to do.

933
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,250
What?

934
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,820
I'm talking about my mom.

935
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,350
She keeps pretending to be okay.

936
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,720
I thought she finally caught a break

937
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,490
and living a happy life
with her dream job.

938
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,860
But the fact that she's married

939
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,630
and that she has kids
is holding her back again.

940
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,040
I know that
she must be having a hard time,

941
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,370
but she doesn't show it.

942
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,650
This is my point.

943
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,250
She made a fatal mistake
of marrying my dad.

944
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,820
But why do you only hate your dad?

945
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,990
Isn't it obvious?

946
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,830
He's not even here on a day like this.

947
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,530
My dad

948
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,970
was never there when we needed him.

949
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,420
But are you sure you're okay?

950
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,750
No.

951
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,660
You should have told me sooner.
Let's go back down.

952
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,490
- Let's get the test again.
- It's not about my health.

953
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,730
It's about my parents' divorce.

954
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,270
Whenever my parents fought,

955
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,710
I kind of blamed myself for being born.

956
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,780
When I see them getting a divorce
in the end,

957
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,910
it really feels like this is my fault

958
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,820
and I feel bad.

959
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,620
It's tough on me,

960
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,350
but to be honest,

961
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,360
I don't want them to get divorced
for my sake.

962
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,970
Si-a is sick.

963
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,610
But hearing how he didn't sound concerned
made me mad.

964
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,810
On top of that, he lied to me.

965
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,210
He lied?

966
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,820
Dae-young quit his job.

967
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,960
But this fool

968
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,860
doesn't even know this came to the house.
He keeps saying he's in Busan.

969
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,500
He said he was on a business trip.

970
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,130
Dae-young lied to you?

971
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,170
But he never lied to you.

972
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,610
He didn't. But he changed too.

973
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,540
Divorce. Resignation.

974
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,080
He's been lying to me about everything

975
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,720
like his situation and his feelings.

976
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,280
I

977
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,060
really can't trust him anymore.

978
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,460
(You were never here for us
when we needed you.)

979
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:32,070
(My dad was never there
when we needed him.)

980
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:38,340
(You know when the final day is, right?)

981
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,980
(Even if you don't show up,
the divorce will go through.)

982
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,320
(Let's end this on a good note.)

983
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,260
You've been living your life all wrong.

984
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:09,270
(Courthouse)

985
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,910
Is Mr. Hong Dae-young
not here again today?

986
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,950
Yes.

987
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,490
Then, I will proceed with my ruling.

988
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,310
He's here.

989
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,250
Hong Dae-young.

990
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,690
(Epilogue)
How dare you punks get into a fight?

991
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,960
Why did you fight?

992
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,890
This jerk hit me

993
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,930
- out of nowhere.
- Out of nowhere?

994
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,700
Why did you hit him?

995
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,730
He told me not to put up with it.

996
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,470
What? Not to put up with it?

997
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,470
Who said that?

998
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,510
Who?

999
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,110
I told you not to bully Ji-ho.

1000
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,480
- Stop it! Let go!
- I told you not to pick on him,

1001
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,480
so don't do it!

1002
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,750
You punks.

1003
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,870
Gosh. There's a baby elephant.

1004
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,740
That's so cute.

1005
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,610
It's so cute.

1006
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,250
If there's a place you want to go to,

1007
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,850
you can tell me. Okay?

1008
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,320
Ji-ho.

1009
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,420
Come quickly. The elephants are so big!

1010
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:12,960
Are you still sad?

1011
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,430
Those little rats.

1012
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,600
I won't let them do that again.

1013
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,400
I heard violence is a bad thing.

1014
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,430
What? Gosh.

1015
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:24,840
My dad told me
that I shouldn't put up with it.

1016
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,730
Right?

1017
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,540
Of course. Ji-ho.

1018
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,900
Violence isn't the right way.

1019
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:34,150
But there are times
you shouldn't put up with bullying.

1020
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,710
When are those times?

1021
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:43,350
When you need to protect
something dear to your heart.

1022
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,260
When I need to protect
something dear to my heart.

1023
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,770
Let's go and take a photo.

1024
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,500
Shall we?

1025
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,730
Let's go!

1026
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,070
(Year 2012, USA)
I was stressed about

1027
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,070
- Yes.
- our professor.

1028
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,550
No one alerted us, you know.

1029
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,050
- Okay.
- Yes.

1030
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,290
(The boy we loved back then)

1031
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,520
(was a memory to someone.)

1032
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,230
(Da-jung, I'm at the zoo with the kids.)

1033
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,800
(We'll be home after dinner.)

1034
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:31,900
The zoo?

1035
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,970
Then, I should relax at home.

1036
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,310
Thank you, honey.

1037
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,150
(To someone, he was her present.)

1038
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,860
(And to someone, he was a dream.)

1039
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,730
Okay. Here it goes.

1040
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,400
(- Years later, the boy from the past)
- All right.

1041
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:02,000
(- became an old man with two kids.)
- Make a V.

1042
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:06,100
(But he was still the same boy)

1043
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,540
(we loved back then.)
