I

19

ruined your life again.

20
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,970
When I found out who you were,

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,080
I should have hidden it.

22
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,879
I should have,
so you could live your own life.

23

It's my fault.

24
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,520
It's not your fault.

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,430
Okay?

26
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,260
It's all thanks to you.

27
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,430
Just like you said,

28
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,900
I'm not going to lose my chance.

29
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,140
You think by giving up on basketball,

30
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,010
I'm making another sacrifice.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,350
Back then, there was a time
I had the same thought.

32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,920
After getting younger,

33
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,120
at first, I was happy
to be able to play basketball again.

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,790
But...

35
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,790

(Hearing our kids call me "Daddy")

47
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:43,430
made me happier than when I was
announced as an MVP.

48
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,430
I didn't realize how precious
those moments were,

49
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,900
and every time things got hard,

50
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,070
I became a fool and regretted

51
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,600
what happened 18 years ago.

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,740
I asked myself, "Would I have been happy
if I didn't give up on basketball?"

53
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,040
I always dreamed of the life
I never lived.

54
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,780
However, I know now

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,310
what kind of life I want.

Da-jung.

57
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
You didn't ruin my life.

58
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,150
You gave me a chance.

59
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,990
And my decision back then

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,530
was the best decision in my life.

61
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,830
I won't

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,730
miss out on that chance.

to trip your daughter over.

Apologize to her.

169
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,190
Yes, you should apologize.

170

You too. You should apologize too.

I'm an old man.
How can I possibly apologize

You said yourself that you need
to apologize if you did wrong.

176

My daughter is as precious to me

177

as yours is to you.

178

I'm being very civil right now,

179
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,720
despite how frustrated my daughter feels.

180
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,120
So, just apologize and leave.

181
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
All right.

182
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,900

we'd love to live together as a family.

And this was the only thing
I could think of.

334
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,150
Thank you.

335
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,560
Let's have a meal together next time.
It's my treat.

336
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,660
Sounds good, Da-jung.

337
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,050
What are you doing?
Why are you just standing there?

338
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,490
Because I'm happy.

339
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,490
About what?

340
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,060
When I was looking at you from here,

341
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,830
I was happy that I didn't have to worry
in case you saw me.

342
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,700
And I was happy that I didn't have to

343
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,200
make up a lame excuse to talk to you.

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,400
I'm also happy
that you are waiting for me.

345
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,670
Gosh. Come on.

346
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm going to be honest from now on.

347
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,350
Some things still have to be said
between spouses.

348
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,750
A popular anchorwoman said that.

349
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Gosh.

350
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,950
Let's go.

351
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,930
(Serim High School)

352
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,500
- Dad.
- My princess.

353
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm glad I ran into you.

354
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,840
- Hello.
- Hey.

355
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,600
You're Bo-bae and Young-seon.

356
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,640
You girls...

357
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,680
It's so nice to see you girls.
It's been a while.

358
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,280
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

359
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,250
Are you here to talk to my teacher
about college?

360
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Yes.

361
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,960
Where are you girls going?
To the snack bar?

362
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,120
How did you know?

363
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,560
If you're heading there around this time
of the day, it's the snack bar.

364
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,800
Here. You three can go
and buy yourself a nice treat.

365
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,230
No. It's okay, Mr. Hong.

366
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,900
Don't be shy. You guys are still growing.

367
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,710
Eat a lot and study hard.

368
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,810
Okay?

369
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,350
I think I heard that from somewhere.

370
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,950
Thank you, Dad.

371
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,550
- Sure thing. I'll get going.
- Okay.

372
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,050
Thank you.

373
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,660
Hey, that's new.

374
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,760
Your dad usually gives you an earful.

375
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,190
What are you talking about?

376
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,630
He's telling me all that for my sake.

377
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,400
Let's go.

378
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

379
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,970
I didn't know that
you would be coming, Mr. Hong.

380
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,140
I heard that you were in Busan.

381
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,840
I recently came back to Seoul.

382
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,610
Then, you must be in the dark
about Si-a's decision for her career.

383
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,150
I know.

384
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,120
And that Si-a does not plan
to go to college?

385
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,460
Yes.

386
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,590
Aren't you sad?

387
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,190
At first, I was.

388
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,330
But there was something else
Si-a really wanted.

389
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,170
And I would like to support her decision.

390
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,510
You are a cool dad.

391
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,010
Naturally, I thought
you would be against it.

392
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,780
I was trying to come up with a way
to persuade you.

393
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,310
I'm ashamed to think that.

394
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,280
Gosh. No.

395
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,350
I should thank you for trying to see this
from Si-a's perspective.

396
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,550
Gosh, don't mention it.

397
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,220
Then,

398
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,590
thank you so much
for taking good care of her.

399
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,830
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

400
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,250
Gosh. I swear I've seen him somewhere.

401
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Woo-young.

402
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,670
Let's win the playoffs and go
to Hankuk University together.

403
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,010
Si-woo.

404
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,310
I don't think I can go
to Hankuk University with you.

405
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,180
What do you mean?

406
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,390
I'm going back to the US as soon as I can.

407
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,460
To the US?

408
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,520
Yes.

409
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,700
How can I do this without you?

410
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,430
Si-woo.

411
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,500
You can be a cool guy
without anybody's help.

412
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,010
And now, you have the guys
from the basketball team.

413
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,240
Won't you regret it
if you don't go to Hankuk University?

414
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Yes.

415
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,950
Si-woo, there are
too many things I cherish

416
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,490
more than basketball.

417
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,390
And I realized that too late.

418
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,230
That's what I regret the most.

419
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,500
You should always live your day
to the fullest.

420
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,440
And never forget your loved ones
around you.

421
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,710
I want you to remember your days
as an 18-year-old

422
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,310
filled with good memories
instead of regrets.

423
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,830
Hey, Si-woo.

424
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,660
Woo-young?

425
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,400
What? Dad.

426
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,830
Good job.

427
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,600
I'm pretty good at basketball too.

428
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,170
But I'm pretty good at basketball too.

429
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
What?

430
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,780
What's that face? Do you not believe me?

431
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,480
Give me the ball.

432
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,330
What do you say? Whoever scores
ten points first gets a free drink.

433
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,000
- I'm in.
- Nice!

434
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,640
I won't go easy on you.

435
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,240
Same here.

436
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,910
Look at that. Come.

437
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,480
Hey, get ready. Go.

438
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,520
Gosh. I was so close.

439
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,320
My body is failing me.

440
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,490
Playing basketball with you

441
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,690
reminds me of Woo-young.

442
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,130
Woo-young?

443
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,100
Yes.

444
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,470
He was my friend

445
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
who was always next to me
whenever I needed him.

446
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,710
Si-woo.

447
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,750
Starting now,

448
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,050
can I take Woo-young's spot

449
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,320
and be your friend?

450
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,090
- You?
- Yes.

451
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,730
When you need me,

452
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll be right there with you.

453
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,030
Sounds good.

454
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,370
Okay.

455
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,520
It feels like yesterday

456
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,450
when we had those two toddlers
crawling in our small studio.

457
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,750
Time flies, doesn't it?

458
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Right.

459
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,590
Treating my time with you guys as a regret

460
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,060
was the biggest mistake of my life.

461
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,630
Wait. Don't tell me
that you have another regret now.

462
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,410
There is one thing I learned
after getting young.

463
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
What is it?

464
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,980
No matter how old you get,

465
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,480
there is always something new to learn.

466
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,310
If you think of it as a regret,
that's the end of it.

467
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,250
But when you think of it
as a lesson learned,

468
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,390
it brings a new beginning.

469
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,020
I'll try to learn more from now on

470
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,190
whether it's about work, life,

471
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,560
or love.

472
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,570
So I'll try to find
what I love to do again.

473
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,300
That's great.

474
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,870
I wanted to tell you that too.

475
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Yes.

476
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,010
I'm going to spend my life

477
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,180
without any regrets.

478
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,150
Yes. Things aren't too late for us.

479
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,650
Let's learn everything we want
and appreciate them.

480
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,250
There are so many things
I want to do with you.

481
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,120
You'll join me, right?

482
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,660
Of course. I can't wait.

483
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,880
What are you looking at?

484
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,280
Is that for me?

485
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,450
(VIP Invitation)

486
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,760
(This is a token of gratitude
to Mr. Hong Dae-young.)

487
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,260
(Please come together.)

488
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,960
A token of gratitude?

489
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,060
What does this mean?

490
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,800
Dae-young. Actually...

491
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
(Ye Ji-hoon)

492
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,850
Oh, Da-jung.

493
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,280
Ji-hoon.

494
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,750
Did you come alone? Where's your husband?

495
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,090
He had something to do, so he'll be late.

496
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,290
Thank you for inviting us to your game.

497
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,830
There's no need to thank me.

498
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,630
That bracelet is pretty.

499
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh, this?

500
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,300
It was a gift from a fan.

501
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,040
They said it was a good luck bracelet,

502
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,270
and it must be true.

503
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,740
After I put this on,

504
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,380
I've only had good things happen.

505
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,510
Really?

506
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,979
Goodness, I don't know who it is,
but that fan must be happy.

507
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,320
Should I lend it to you

508
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,019
for today's game?

509
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,390
No, that bracelet suits you better,

510
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,420
so cheer for me during the game.

511
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,990
That's good enough for me.

512
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,760
Then I'll cheer for you with my husband.

513
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,130
Good luck!

514
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,439
Did you just get here?

515
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:22,510
Yes.

516
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,380
Seo-yeon. Hello.

517
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,450
You got so big.

518
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,150
It's been a while.

519
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,650
Mister. Do you know me?

520
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,260
(Ye Ji-hoon is stepping up to the mound.)

521

(Yes. Ye Ji-hoon has been in a long slump recently.)

522
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,640
(Some people thought that he was injured.)

523
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,970
(It seems like everyone is focused on him
in today's game.)

524

(From Jung Da-jung, I'll always cheer for you!)

(What do you think will happen in today's game?)

526
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,250
(Ye Ji-hoon looks a lot better today than before.)

527
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,450
(He was a bit unstable in the previous games,)

528
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,520
(but he has always been the hero
to save Seum Wolves from trouble.)

529
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,960
(I think we can expect
good results from him today.)

530

Strike!

531

Thank you.

Did you watch me play?

Yes. You were the coolest!

What flavor?

558
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,180
- Chocolate ice cream.

Pardon?

When did you have time to make this?

You just transferred here.

Why are you going so suddenly?

581
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,510
I found my real dad.

582
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,110
What do you mean by your real dad?

583
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,650
To be honest,

584
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,450
the person you know as my dad

585
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,390
isn't my biological dad.

586
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,450
What?

587
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,920
He was helping me

588
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,190
by pretending to be my dad.

589
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,290
He's not even my biological dad,

590
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,300
but he went through so much trouble
by taking me in.

591
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,160
He even

592
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,570
tried to give up on someone special
for my sake.

593
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,140
That's why I want my dad
to live as Go Deok-jin

594
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,040
and not the father of a student.

595
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,690
Why didn't you say anything?

596
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,860
I just wanted to help him.

597
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,730

598

I mean,

601

Deok-jin, from now on,
if you're having a hard time,

602
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,680
come to me whenever you want
and tell me about it.

603
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,180

but I'll work hard to fill the emptiness

- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

612
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,420
Should I take it off?

613

No.

she's said about us.)

662
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,250
Hong Si-woo?

663
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,720
Probably in a fight.

664
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,290
Did I do something wrong again?

665
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,420
- You go and think about it on your own!
- Come on.

666
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,360
You have to tell me so that I'd know.

667
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,760
Do you really not know?

668
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,330
You keep smiling at your fangirls!

669
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,430
Don't you think I'd get scared
that I might lose you?

670
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,800
You changed after going to college.

671
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,610
What?

672
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,580
All right. I won't ever do that again.

673
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,910
But So-mi,

674
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,450
my dad said

675
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,580
that a man must not ever let go of a woman

676
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,650
who was there for him
during his difficult times.

677
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,760
So, don't you ever worry.

678
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,160
Gosh.

679
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,990
Come here.

680
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,070
Talking about Si-woo reminds me of Woo-young.

681
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,240
Woo-young was so cool when he played basketball.

682
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,070
He was a great basketball player and a listener.

683
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,080
Yes, it was like it was his second time living life.

684
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,880
Woo-young must be even more mature
and even better-looking now, right?

685
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,690
Why did he suddenly leave?

686
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,320
I don't know.
And we can't get in touch with him.

687
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,620
I'm worried for him.

688
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,930
I'm sure the man is doing just fine.

689
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,500
"The man"? You're talking
as if he's an old man.

690
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,830
What?

691
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,710
Talking about Woo-young is making me miss him.

692
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,040
You're right. I hope he's doing well.

693
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,220
You know that this game is
your last chance if you lose, right?

694
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,720
But I know that this is

695
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,990
only the start for us.

696
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,060
Gather up.

697
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,500
We can do it as long as we don't give up.

698

- Dribble!

703
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,540
Pass! There you go!

704
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,540
That way! Right on!

We thought we'd visit you.

712
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,530
You look like a professional golfer.

713
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
You look stunning.

Are you getting jealous of her again?

It's nothing like that.

716

Isn't it ridiculous?

Hey, Seul-hye!

00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,480
I can't believe it.

719
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,220
She saw me,

720
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,050
but completely ignored me, right?

721
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:08,060
I don't know.
She might've been distracted by her call.

722
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,530
She's been like that ever since she came in.

723
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,530
She keeps looking down on me
because I'm her age but more senior.

724
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,700
It's like newbies these days don't know what manner is!

725

I know I was one of them before.

Look at you. You've grown.

Yes.

I haven't seen him in a while.

730
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,320
Director? Which one?

731
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,490
- What?
- You probably don't know.

732

- That's too bad.

You're right.

What's wrong with that? We're lovers.

751
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,530
You've become bolder
after living young once.

752
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,930
Of course.

753
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,540
What's there to fear
when we only live once?

754
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,540
We have to be bold and do whatever
we want to do in life.

That being said,

756

there's somewhere we have to go.

let's have a wedding.

766
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You said that you're fine,

767
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,240
but when we were young,
we couldn't afford a wedding,

768
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,140
and when we got older,
we didn't have the time for it.

769
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,280
But our kids are in college now,

And I

772
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,560
really want to see you in a wedding dress.

as expensive as other men,

Let's go.

826
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,900
All right. Run!

827
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,700
- Go.
- Run!

828
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,300
- We're still holding.
- Run faster.

829
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,070
- Run!
- Run!

830
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,150
Da-jung!

831
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,720
Ae-rin!

832
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,490
This is nice.

833
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,830
Da-jung, how do you feel?

834
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,470
I feel awesome!

835
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,810
Congratulations on your wedding!

836
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,010
Be happy, Da-jung!

837
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,350
Ae-rin, thank you! I'm happy!

838
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,480
- Gosh, I did it.
- That's it.

839
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,390
Kick the ball. That's it.

840
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,320
There you go.

841
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,390
I won't pass it!

842
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,100
She's having a blast.

843
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,800
I won't pass it!

844
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,170
Hey, Deok-jin.

845
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,540
Hey, forget it. I don't need a wedding present.
Just come to the wedding.

846
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,270
No, don't say that.
My friend of 20 years is getting married.

847
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,140
I can't go there empty-handed.

848
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,610
You can count on it.

849
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,350
What present is he thinking about?

850
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,720
How about this for a wedding present?

851
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,290
What?

852
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,890
This isn't right.

853
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,830
It's supposed to be a wedding present.

854
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,390
I see.

855
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,100
That's more like it.

856
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,810
I knew it. I can't be as sharp as you.

857
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,910
Goodness. That jerk, Go Deok-jin.

858
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,670
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

859
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,880
Thank you.

860
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,540
Thank you. This way.

861
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,450
You look beautiful!

862
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,790
- You look handsome!
- How beautiful!

863
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:11,850
You look so beautiful!

864
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,340
Mother, we will live a good life together.

865
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,250
Yes.

866
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,820
My proud son-in-law. Be happy.

867
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,320
We will be, Mother.

868
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,460
My gosh. You're about to cry now.

869
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,400
No, I'm not.

870
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,570
Live a good and happy life.

871
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Okay.

872
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,550
Thank you.

873
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,580
Thanks.

874
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
I guess some people
are meant to cross paths.

875
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:48,680
All right. Now, the families of
the bride and the groom will take photos.

876
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,590
Here we go. Look over here!

877
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,430
(If)

878
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,730
(our story stopped here
like an ending of a movie,)

879
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,000
(my life)

880
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,700
(would have been a happy ending.)

881
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,270
(However...)

882
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,220
What? Are you drinking alone again?

883
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,790
Go back inside. I want to be alone.

884
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:14,860
(From time to time, we find ourselves struggling.)

885
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,870
Leave it.

886
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,630
No. I'll do it.

887
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,680
That's not how you do it.

888
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,980
Why are you yelling at me?

889
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,150
I won't do it.

890
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,450
I won't either.

891
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,150
My goodness. You and your temper.

892
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,960
Did I ask for your help?

893
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,430
(We fight and get disappointed.)

894
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,490
Jung Da-jung. Come on.

895
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,560
Sleep in the living room.

896
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,870
You're so selfish!

897
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,840
(There are days when we hated each other.)

898
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,240
(But...)

899
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,180
It must have been tough to go through that all alone.

900
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,620
It feels much better after talking to you about it.

901
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,080
Thank you.

902
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,920
(Thanks to that, we understand each other better.)

903
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,060
Why did you make so much food?

904
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,930
Please eat a lot.

905
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,430
Okay. Let's eat.

906
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:29,910
Thank you.

907
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,280
(We learn to appreciate each other more.)

908
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,910
(And we love more.)

909
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,810
All right. This is for you, Si-a.

910
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,520
This is for you, Si-woo.

911
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,620
Thank you, Dad.

912
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,490
All right. And this is for my lovely wife.

913
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,560
- Thanks.
- Sure.

914
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,560
Ta-da.

915
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,390
There's one for me?

916
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,630
Thank you,

917
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:54,000
- my love.
(- There were more days)

918
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,100
(when we were happier.)

919
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,450
That's so cool.

920
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,690
Let's never let go of each other's hand

921
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,090
until we grow old together like them.

922
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,740
We should never let go of each other's hand
for the rest of our lives.

923
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,090
(Thinking back,)

924
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,420
(endless happiness was always in our lives.)

925
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,290
(Anyone can find it)

926
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,890
(and enjoy it.)

927
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,430
(It's a common luxury all of us can have.)

928
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,770
(For that happiness,)

929
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:08,400
(we decided to love our decisions.)

930
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,940
(We chose people based on love.)

931
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,780
(And we are grateful for our decisions.)

932
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,980
(And)

933
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,020
(as for my loved ones and myself
who are living diligently as always,)

934
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,020
(I would like to cheer them on
to the end of time.)

935
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,660
(In life,)

936
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:33,660
(even if you miss out on happiness...)

937
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,370
(As long as you have that one person
who will look for happiness with you,)

938
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,340
(your life will be worth living.)

939
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,570
(Don't forget that you love each other.)

940
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,740
(Be disappointed
that you cannot cherish each other better.)

941
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,380
(And promise for a better tomorrow.)

942
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:02,760
(Just like that, our lives)

943
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,330
(will continue.)

944
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,820
(Thank you for watching 18 Again.)
