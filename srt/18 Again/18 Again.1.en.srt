00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,960
I really hope I can. Please.

166
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,470
Look at your family portrait again
and gain energy.

167
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,900
Of course.

168
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,510
You're going to get promoted today,
so you must be happy to work.

169
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,570
Of course.

170
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,780
(- Let's go.
- Gosh, I'm jealous.)

171
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,610
(Nuri Elementary School)

172
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,220
I need to go out. Hurry up already.

173
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,660
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I will finish up quickly.

174
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,530
I refuse to pay you for coming here!
You said it wasn't broken!

175
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,530
The cost for coming here
and repair costs are separate.

176
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,300
Then you should've told me this
in advance.

177
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,070
Do you want to get a zero
in your service ratings?

178
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,410
I'm sorry, ma'am.

179
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,520
What is this smell?

180
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,550
- Pardon?
- Your feet smell so much.

181
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,660
I was wondering why I smelled garbage!
It was me.

182
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,730
Gosh, do you have any common sense?

183
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,210
You'll get a call later
asking if everything was fixed well.

184
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,480
Please give me a ten out of ten.

185
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,250
Okay.

186
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,050
Can you throw this out for me?

187
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,390
I really feel like working today.

188
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,290
Sir, everything has been fixed.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,300
Where did he go?

190
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,170
Gosh. I thought it was a real raccoon.

191
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,600
That surprised me.

192
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,970
"Do you want to be young again?"

193
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,140
Why bother asking?
Of course I want to be young again.

194
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,850
Gosh, he must have his doctorate.

195
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,480
He even has a lot of medicine.

196
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,180
("A Drug That Buys Youth",
"The Time of Reverting Cells")

197
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,490
He must really like raccoons.
There's another one here.

198
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,590
Did you fix everything?

199
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,630
Yes, sir. I fixed everything.

200
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,860
Is that so? Then fix this one for me too.

201
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,330
I'm sorry, sir.
I only fix washing machines.

202
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,550
I fixed it, sir.

203
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,350
You're good at fixing things.

204
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,950
Why do you only fix washing machines?

205
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,250
I think you'd be good
at fixing everything.

206
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,660
I can fix almost everything.

207
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,190
I wish I could fix my life like this too.

208
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,470
Do you want me to fix it for you?

209
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,050
Thank you.

210
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,820
However, it's my life,

211
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,790
so I should fix it myself.

212
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,560
Is that so?

213
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,100
- Open up.
- Open up.

214
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,900
- You're eating so well, my daughter.
- Goodness.

215
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,770
- Son, do you want to have some too?
- You're eating so well.

216
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,470
Have some fishcakes too.

217
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,440
Have this too.

218
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,010
You're eating well.

219
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,020
Hey Si-a, you said today was
Foundation Day at your school, right?

220
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,720
Come out with Si-woo.
Let's get something to eat.

221
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
Yes.

222
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,100
Si-a, have some meat. It's expensive.

223
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,040
Gosh, why is my nose bridge so low?

224
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,710
- Should I get a nose job?
- What did you just say?

225
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,680
I told you not to touch my nose!

226
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,480
- My nose.
- Enough of that.

227
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,380
Didn't I tell you? When you go out into society,
there are three types of people.

228
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,390
Those who do really well, those who do well,
and those who just do.

229
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,720
If you don't study, and focus only on your looks...

230
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,760
I'll just enter society.

231
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,920
I see you're well aware.

232
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,160
What about your future?
Is there anything you want to do?

233
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,460
No.

234
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, right. Si-woo, are you really
not going to play basketball?

235
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,500
You were good at basketball
when you were younger.

236
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,940
I'm not interested.

237
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,670
What on earth are you guys interested in?

238
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,880
Are you going to waste your good years
by doing nothing?

239
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,220
Si-a, Si-woo. You guys don't need to worry
about your mom and me divorcing.

240
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,050
My promotion will be announced today.

241
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,320
If I get promoted,
your mom will have a change of heart too.

242
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,390
I had a dream about a fire.

243
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
Do you think it was a dream
about your promotion?

244
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,360
Did you get rid of the fire or not?

245
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,760
I didn't.

246
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,170
Then it's settled. Sell that dream to me.

247
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,470
Okay. Give me 50,000 won.

248
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,810
Gosh. It's a dream for your promotion.

249
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,740
You should pay at least 50,000 won.

250
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,680
Fine, since I'm in a good mood.

251
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,180
Hey, Bo-bae. Over here.

252
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,159
- Hello, Mr. Hong.
- Hi.

253
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,720
Did you eat?

254
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,899
Bo-bae, you're a student.
Don't you think you're wearing too much makeup?

255
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,970
A student should look like a student.

256
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,000
- Right.
- Stop it already.

257
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,409
If you worked out as much as you nagged,
you'd be muscular.

258
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,740
I have plans with Bo-bae, so I'm going.
Enjoy your meal.

259
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Si-a, you should eat first.

260
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,210
It's expensive meat!

261
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,960
How is your mom these days?

262
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,390
She's really depressed, right?

263
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,110
Your mom isn't in a good mood,
so you guys have to be good to her.

264
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,380
You should be good to her.

265
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,580
- Good job everyone.
- Good job.

266
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,520
Ms. Jung Da-jung?

267
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,860
- Yes, Director.
- Say hello.

268
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,830
She will be taking over
your position from now on.

269
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,560
Hello.

270
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,430
Then what about my position?

271
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
It's at home. You're a housewife.

272
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,870
Gosh, Director.

273
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,970
Who's ever born to be a wife?

274
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,840
Were you born a producer at birth, too?

275
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,670
Your kids are in grade 12.

276
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
It's an important time for them to focus
on their studies,

277
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,910
so how interruptive would it be
if you sang and danced on TV

278
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,380
just because you want to be a reporter?

279
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,880
They're still in grade 11.

280
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,420
You're being greedy.

281
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,060
There's a different reason
why I'm being fired, isn't there?

282
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,690
What?

283
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,790
When you got drunk the last staff dinner

284
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,830
and forcefully hugged the youngest staff,

285
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,330
I called you out on it.

286
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,030
Aren't I being fired because of that?

287
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,870
You're infuriating me.

288
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,570
You think you can say whatever you want?

289
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,570
Your job is so easy for you, isn't it?

290
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,240
You think I'll be a little kinder to you
just because you have kids?

291
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,880
Goodness.

This is all a reward for your hard work.

294

The day has finally come.

295
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,920
May I say with caution,

296
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,390
congratulations, Department Head Hong!

297
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,760
Don't make a big deal out of it.

298
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,160
He's coming.

299
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,940
Everyone, thank you so much
for all of your hard work this quarter.

Let's give a round of applause

to all the engineers that worked diligently

302

to get a promotion that only comes
every five years!

303
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,410
Congratulations!

304
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,220
I will now announce

305
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,360
the new department head.

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,470
Sure.

Let's give him a round of applause!

314
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,320
And I have an announcement.

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,820
- Hong Dae-young,
- Yes, sir?

when he's been here for only four years?

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,420
He's the branch manager's nephew.

325
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,290
It's so unfortunate for people like us,
who don't have connections.

326
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,690
At least we're better off

327
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,060
than Dae-young.

328
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,130
Sir.

329
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,400
Keep drinking.

330
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,840
What now?

331
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,710
How could I have worked for ten years

332
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,720
and still be a regular employee?

333
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,420
Your wage is still increasing.

334
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,720
You promised me that I'd get promoted
every five years.

335
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,390
You said that it's a low wage,
but with a lot of potentials,

336
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,260
I could hold onto. That's been ten years!

337
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,930
Everything changes within three years
nowadays.

338
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,830
Did I expect so many university graduates
to come for us?

339
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,500
Hyeon-cheol graduated from a university.

340
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,040
You have to make way for him
since you only graduated high school.

341
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,710
Then can you at least

342
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,180
stop my relocation to Busan?

343
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,710
You know that I'm going through a divorce
right now!

344
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,180
Things are really over if I move to Busan.

345
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,580
If you're so desperate,

346
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,590
why have you been skipping out
on our staff dinners?

347
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,590
Pardon?

348
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,760
I know this is an electronics company,

349
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,630
but it's a company after all!

350
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,530
If you're lacking in education,
you should've worked on your connections!

351
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,900
You think capable people are
just good at what they do?

352
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,910
You told me a month ago
that if I fulfill my share of work,

353
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,340
I'd certainly be promoted!

354
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,510
Come on!

355
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,110
Are you really going to get so worked up,

356
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,220
just because your junior got promoted
faster than you did?

357
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,450
I worked really hard.

358
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,460
I've been treating this job
like my job for life,

359
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,060
letting customers push me around,
holding their reviews over my head,

360
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,030
spent many days putting my own money
into the repairs,

361
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,760
and have gone through thick and thin

362
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,230
in the past ten years.

363
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,670
So, why can't I get promoted?

364
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
Why am I being relocated?

365
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,640
Hong Dae-young, this personality of yours

366
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,180
is why your life is such a mess.

367
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,350
You always do things that you'll regret.

368
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,050
Calm down.

369
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,260
It makes sense how you had
an accidental baby when you were young.

370
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,370
I'm only holding back

371
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,740
for my family.

372
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,540
Family? Gosh.

373
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,780
How pathetic for a woman and a child
to depend on a man like that?

374
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,380
They're obviously failures in life.

375
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,420
Let's keep on drinking.

376
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
You!

377
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,160
I am

378
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
quitting today!

379
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,820
Did you just finish work?

380
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,260
Did you drink again?

381
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,800
Should I get on my knees?

382
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,070
Why should you?

383
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,270
Because I did you wrong.

384
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,340
What did you do wrong?

385
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
You didn't get promoted,

386
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,880
did you?

387
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,360
It never mattered, anyway.

388
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,060
You know that tomorrow is
our first settlement meeting, right?

389
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,700
I'll see you at court.

390
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,430
Da-jung,

391
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,200
I don't want to get a divorce.

Hong Dae-young,

396
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,160
what happened to you?

397
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,500
If I make this shot, grant me a wish.

398
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,370
Okay.

399
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,170
That's a promise.

400
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,440
Okay.

401
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,580
Da-jung.

402
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,480
- Go out with me.
- What?

403
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,830
What was that? That was too easy for you.

404
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,430
Easy, my foot.

405
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,000
Gosh.

406
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,520
This is my last one. If I make this shot,

407
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,790
my wish will come true.

408
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,790
Dae-young,

409
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,160
let's go back.

410
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,880
What was that all of a sudden?

411
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,160
Did it go in or not?

412
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,200
Hey, kid. What are you doing there?

413
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,630
- Get out of here!
- I'm sorry!

414
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,620
Gosh. Why am I getting hungry
at times like this?

415
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,620
Hello.

416
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,930
Skipping a meal did the trick
of getting rid of my belly fat.

You.

426
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,500
You! What are you doing here?

427
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,970
- What?
- You...

428
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,340
You should be studying right now!

429
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,570

Please don't mind me.

This is a family matter.

- You crazy jerk.
- "Crazy jerk"?

How dare you say that to your own father?

439
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,100
On top of lying to me,
you pretend you don't know me?

Let's go outside.

441

- How young do I look?

Gosh. Darn it. They are driving me crazy.
Why did this happen?

Am I dreaming?

Darn it. I'm not dreaming.
This isn't a dream.

Gosh. I'm about to lose it.

Hong Si-a, you stay there.

462
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,220
I'll come back once I fix this problem.

Why are you coming back?
Don't come back, you lunatic!

You lunatic.

- It's okay.
- It was scary.

Deok-jin, it's me. Dae-young.

472
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,300
Stop right there.

473
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,540
- Dae-young.
- What?

474
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
- Hong Dae-young.
- What?

Put that down.

I tuned it up just in case
for a day like this.

483

Come on.

00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,680
No.

485
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,040
No!

No.

487
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,850
You killed her.

488
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,590
My first love!

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,950
I'm sorry, man.

490
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,710
Deok-jin, put that down for now.

491
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,940
- I hope you have no regrets.
- Calm down.

492
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,710
You're the one who awoke the evil monster
I've kept deep down inside me.

493
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,350
Come at me!

494
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,050
Darn it. Come on.

495
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,720
Hey!

496
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,520
Hey!

497
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,020
You!

498
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,390
Hey!

499
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,820
Hey!

500
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,830
Hey!

501
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,200
Hey, I'm your friend, Hong Dae-young.

502
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,670
As if!

503
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,140
Dae-young is uglier than me!

504
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,670
Hey!

505
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,370
You.

506
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,950
Hey.

507
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,310
Hey.

508
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,580
Hey.

509
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,760
You!

510
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,530
You!

511
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,260
No!

512
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,160
(Son)

513
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,700
Don't call him.

514
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,970
If he finds out I'm working here,
he'll throw a fit.

515
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,570
He's not even answering anyway.

516
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,370
Gosh, it's so obvious.

517
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,870
He's probably busy
hanging out with Deok-jin.

518
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,410
Hey.

519
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,450
Gosh.

520
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,790
Do you seriously think
I'll believe that you're Dae-young?

521
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,420
Dae-young is...

522
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,930
(Deok-jin, it's me. Dae-young.)

523
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,260
(I'm Hong Dae-young.)

524
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,900
(I'm really Dae-young.)

525
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,290
How is your hairstyle
exactly the same as when you were 18?

526
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,890
Have you been exposed to gamma rays
at work?

527
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,460
I fix washing machines.

528
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,330
Are any of your ancestors
Dracula or a cyborg?

529
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,900
Enough already.

530
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,070
Really?

531
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,930
If none of these applies to you...

532
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,030
That's right.

533
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,470
Did you partake in an experiment
or take any drugs?

534
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,640
I told you that was enough.

535
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,980
I didn't partake in an experiment
nor did I take any drugs.

536
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,380
After I lost my job, I was depressed,

537
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,010
so I went to shoot some hoops.

538
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,450
My gosh.

539
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
School?

540
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,190
So you're saying
you threw the ball and made a wish

541
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,760
and that wish came true?

542
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,990
Yes.

543
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,100
I said if it goes it, I'll go back.

544
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,030
Really?

545
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,510
It's really hard.

546
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,540
It makes sense to fulfill a wish
after getting it in.

547
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,840
The power went out suddenly,

548
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,510
so I don't know if it really went in.

549
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,080
Either way, after that moment,
people started calling me a student.

550
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,620
It all worked out then.
You always said you wanted to go back.

551
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,390
I was talking about going back home.

552
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,290
Having a younger body
is 5.005 trillion times better

553
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,790
than going back home.

554
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,160
If I were you,
I'd get naked and start dancing.

555
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,560
You've received a divine gift,
and if you don't unwrap it,

556
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,360
the divinity would feel awkward too.

557
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,170
What's your dream?

558
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,670
My dream?

559
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,010
You're young again.
You're at an age full of dreams and hope.

560
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,840
What's your dream
now that you're young again?

561
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,110

562
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,780
I'm young again?

Yes!

Do you want to come here
during your divorce?

Why are you wearing a mask?
Who would recognize you?

Of course. I'm in a great mood.

Of course. Let's celebrate. My treat.

Do people celebrate divorces these days?

Didn't I tell you?
I'm sure she's having an affair.

617

How can she betray me like this?

00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,080
Deok-jin, have a seat.

653
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,790
I'm Go Deok-jin.

654
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,020
I see.

655
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,730
Okay.

656
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,960
Here.

657
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,260
I'm Go Woo-young.

658
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,430
Oh, your name is Woo-young? Take a seat.

659
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Okay.

660
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,900
Go Woo-young.

661
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,500
I wanted to name him Deok-woo,

662
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,410
but he was so against it that
I named him Go Woo-young.

663
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,880
He was against it?

664
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,510
Regardless,

665
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,220
he was homeschooled?

666
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,650
When they should be running around,

667
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,350
kids are busy with performance assessments
and college exams.

668
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,090
All they do is go to school,
academies, and home.

669
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,320
I believe that building character
is first.

670
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,230
I believe that Korea's education system
is spoiled rotten.

671
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,600
Then why do you want to
send him to school now?

672
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,270
You can't avoid bad things in life.

673
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,810
Ms. Ok.

674
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,680
I think differently from him...

675
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,150
I mean, I think differently from my dad.

676
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,720
When would I get another chance to spend
time with kids my age?

677
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,920
There's a lot I didn't get to do,

678
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,260
so I want to try doing everything
this time.

679
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,530
Okay.

680
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,830
You can start tomorrow.

681
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,910
Let's get along.

682
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,610
Yes, I look forward
to being in your class.

683
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,850
See you tomorrow!

684
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,280
Bye now.

685
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,750
See you tomorrow!

686
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,160
- Bye now.
- Thank you!

687
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,100
What a strange man.

688
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,740
I missed this smell.

689
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,550
Get ready and come out.

690
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,390
How is Si-a late every morning?

691
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,330
You're so cold.

692
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,460
You know that today is
my final interview, right?

693
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,800
How do I look today?

694
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,340
- Your makeup is cakey.
- Really?

695
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,070
That's not good.

696
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,150
Sir,

697
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,020
she's pregnant. Could you give her
your seat please?

698
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,120
If you're pregnant, stay home.

699
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,760
Why do you need to be a nuisance
to society by going out?

700
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,660
- He's insane.
- How could you say such a thing?

701
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,900
I'm fine.

702
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,800
How dare you treat your elders like this?

703
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,670
Kids these days are so rude.

704
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,570
I can't just watch this.

705
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,510
Come on.

706
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,980
What's wrong with a pregnant man
wanting to sit

707
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,890
on a seat reserved for pregnant women?

708
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,760
Look at his belly. It's nice and plump.

709
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,730
It's definitely going to be a daughter.

710
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,260
What?

711
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,070
How dare you make fun
of an elder like that?

712
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,400
It's fine.

713
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,270
Stay seated.

714
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,570
You seem like you're due soon,
judging from your big belly.

715
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,610
Thanks and congratulations on contributing
to highering the low birth rate.

716
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,710
That's hilarious.

717
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,610
How is a kid so clever?

718
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,680
Driver!

719
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:32,920
I'm getting off.

720
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,550
How annoying.

721
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,660
I hope your birthing goes well!

722
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,930
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

723
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,300
No, you are entitled to that seat.

724
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,660
The kid is full of surprises.

725
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,670
Everyone,

726
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,380
you know that the English assessment is
due today, right?

727
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,810
I'll be collecting them after this.

728
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,650
- Come on.
- Really?

729
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,800
He said,
"Congratulations on your pregnancy."

730
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,770
It was so satisfying to watch.

731
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But his face looks even more satisfying.

732
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,770
His face is so refreshing to see!

733
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,240
Quiet.

734
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,640
We have a new student today.

735
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:08,610
Come in.

736
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,380
It's Sprite.

737
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,410
Si-a, wake up!

738
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,220
It's him!

739
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,320
Even dogs don't bother another dog
when they're asleep.

740
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:49,390
Nice to meet you.

741
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,420
- Please introduce yourself.
- Yes.

742
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,800
Hello, I'm Hong Dae...

743
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,900
No,

744
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,740
I'm Go Woo-young.

745
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,140
I'm 18...

746
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,240
I'm 18 years old.

747
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,810
Nice to meet you all!

748
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,980
No!

749
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,990
Hong Si-a, you just wait there.

750
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,920
I'm going to come back
once I sort this through!

751
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,260
That punk!

752
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,900
Hong Si-a! Watch your language.

753
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,510
Woo-young was homeschooled,

754
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,720
so he's new to being at school.
Please be kind and help him out.

755
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

756
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,320
Would you like to sit over there?

757
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,750
Sure.

758
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,860
Ji-ho, please take good care of him
as the class president.

759
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,860
Yes, ma'am.

760
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,030
Have a great day, everyone.

761
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,830
- Okay!
- Okay!

762
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,060
Why is that lunatic here?

763
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,230
Lunatic?

764
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,600
He's completely insane!

765
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,170
This is bad.

766
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,420
You're Seo Ji-ho, right?

767
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,560
You grew so much in the time
I haven't seen you for!

768
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,160
- You know me?
- Of course.

769
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,800
You're my Si-a's friend.

770
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,600
- "My Si-a"?
- Yes.

771
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,470
Did you also go
to Pungin Elementary School?

772
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,440
Yes.

773
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,140
I guess we went to the same school.

774
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,510
Let me know if you need any help.

775
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,210
Thank you.

776
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,680
Nice to meet you.

777
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,590
Sure.

778
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,720
Look at you.

(JBC Anchor Blind Hiring)

781
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,220
Silla had the bone-rank system
and the hwarang system,

782
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,190
and residents of Silla were

783
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,890
controlled by the bone-rank system.

784
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,260
What's the bone-rank system?

785
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,360
Oh, no.

786
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,200
Hey!

787
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,530
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm just going to the bathroom.

788
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,810
Seems like we have a real idiot in class.

789
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,010
The bone-rank system.

790
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,510
Yes?

791
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,150
You're finally picking up.

792
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,150
I've been busy. I'm on a work trip.

793
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,560
I'm in Busan right now.

794
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,520
You sound great for someone who's busy.

795
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,460
It must be the air in Busan.

796
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,600
You got my text, right?

797
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:24,270
I know you're busy, but you have to come
to the second settlement meeting.

798
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,140
If you don't come, I'll take it
that you're giving up child custody.

799
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,540
Who says you can do that?

800
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,940
You can't take the kids.

801
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,950
You never even cared about the kids,
so why now?

802
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,850
What are you talking about?

803
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,360
You may not know,

804
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,260
but I'm closer to the kids
than you can ever imagine.

805
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,870
- Excuse me?
- What?

806
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,580
Is someone in there?

807
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,450
Could you open the door for me?

808
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,050
I heard that bullying was getting bad,
but this is terrible.

809
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Thank you.

810
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,340
Who did this to you?

811
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,180
Who did this to you?

812
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,010
I don't think we've met.

813
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,480
Do we know each other?

814
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,850
No. I'm sorry. My name is Go Woo-young.

815
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,990
You know your father's friend,
Go Deok-jin?

816
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,060
That's my dad.

817
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:47,860
I didn't know he had a son.

818
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,860
But he never got married.

819
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,070
He did. He did get married,

820
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,100
but my mom wanted to keep it a secret.

821
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,000
I never get adults.

822
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,470
Anyway, thank you.

823
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,180
Don't tell other students about this.

824
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,040
If they find out, they'll target you too.

825
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,550
They'll target me?

826
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,750
Who on earth did this to you?

827
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:14,550
Bye.

828
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,990
You should be careful too.

829
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,660
"Be careful"?

830
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,930
Why are they bullying you?

831
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,170
Mind your own business.

832
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Was it him?

833
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,600
Don't look at his eyes.

834
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,470
Don't look at him.

835
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,290
Si-woo has a friend now.

836
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,800
A loser has friends too, I guess.

837
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,580
Hey!

838
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,690
You come here.

839
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,380
Give it back.

840
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,310
The ball?

841
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:57,450
Sure.

842
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,530
You

843
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,900
need a good lesson.

844
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,660
(Fall of 2001)

845
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,860
(No.)

846
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,600
(No? Are you going
to have that baby then?)

847
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,900
You're carrying twins.

848
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,600
Don't be stubborn. Get an abortion.

849
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,740
I'm looking out for you.

850
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,540
But I don't want that!

851
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,740
What about college?

852
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,140
Will you live just as a mom?

853
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,380
Yes. I will.

854
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,550
You... You must be out of your mind.

855
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,150
You must be crazy.

856
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,820
What choice do I have?

857
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,790
How can I get rid of them
when they are alive?

858
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,270
I read it in a book

859
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:29,380
that babies can understand
everything the parents say.

860
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,780
Since I'm carrying two babies,
let's double up on compliments.

861
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,310
Okay?

862
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,650
It's hard, right?

863
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:47,790
Should we

864
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,860
give up the babies?

865
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:52,630
What?

866
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,970
We're still young.

867
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,040
No.

868
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,710
Da-jung, let's look at our reality.

869
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,280
Our reality?
Is giving up our babies your reality?

870
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,420
- That's not it.
- Is it hard?

871
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,820
If it is, you go on
and live your own life.

872
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,360
Da-jung, if you regret this later--

873
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,430
I

874
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,030
can feel our babies.

875
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,690
Call that girl now.
Let's take her to the hospital.

876
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,220
Why do you care, Dad?

877
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,420
You punk!

878
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,530
You ruined your life
because I didn't care enough!

879
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:55,930
If you want to ruin anything,
just ruin your life.

880
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,960
Don't ruin that poor girl's life.

881
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,510
They can't hear

882
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,380
the babies' heartbeat.

883
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,520
I can't conclude anything right now.

884
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,360
But if this is a missed abortion,

885
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,830
we may have to perform
dilation and curettage.

886
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:14,570
I'm sorry.

887
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,340
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

888
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,620
Daddy is

889
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,220
so sorry.

890
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,060
Daddy is sorry.

891
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,360
I'm

892
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,090
sorry.

893
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,790
The babies must have heard your voices.

894
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:05,930
(Life always weighs
on a more important side.)

895
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,890
(And even if the weight)

896
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,400
(made us give up a lot more,)

897
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,040
(we thought nothing would be
as important as having these babies.)

898
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,940
(And that's how)

899
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,680
(we became their parents.)

900
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,080
