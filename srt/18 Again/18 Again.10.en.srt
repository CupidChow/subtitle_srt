00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,990
Come over here. Come here.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,620
All right. Line up straight.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,020
You guys are always late to school.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,500
I've seen you guys around a lot here.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,430
How can you be late to school every day?

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm talking to all of you. I told you
so many times to be on time.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Why can't you come to school early?

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,970
You, Da-jung. Are you late again?

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,910
How come you're late to school every day?

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,750
Why are you always late to school?

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,220
This is exhausting, so stop talking to me.

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,330
Give it back.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,740
Don't worry, Jung Da-jung.

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,510
I'll take care of you.

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,480
What? Who will you take care of?

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,650
I will make sure you're not late
for school anymore.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,510
Let's take her bag.

18
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,040

- Hey.

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,840
- What are you looking at?
- Please let go.

21
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,980
- No.
- We're not done talking.

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,050
- Hello, everyone.
- Who are you?

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,750
I'm...

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,050
- What's this?
- Safety equipment.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,450
Hold tight.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,860
Hey, run!

27
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,890
Oh, my gosh.

28

the person you're destined for

40
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,830
Destined for?

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,500
I'll double-knot it,
so it doesn't get undone.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm done.

43
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,740
Do you want to come to the gym later?

44
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,250
The gym? Why?

45
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,710
I have something to give you.

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,250
Okay.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,970
What do you want to give me?

48
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,780
- This.
- Oh, it's my bag.

49
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,610
Thank goodness.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,080
If you're that happy,
can you grant me a wish?

51
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,820
- A wish?
- Yes.

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,730
If I get the ball in the net from here,
grant me a wish.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,900
Okay.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,800

- Be my girlfriend!
- What?

57
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,990
What was that? It was too easy.

58
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,390
But

59
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,700
I can't grant you your wish.

60
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,740
What? Okay. Wait...

It's almost time for the Serim High School festival to end.

62

- No.
- Do you want it to continue?

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
- Yes!
- Yes.

64
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,290
- Do you want it to continue?
- Yes!

65

A special performance has been prepared
so that we don't leave disappointed.

a surveillance camera at that alley?

paid taxes in your life?

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,140
Why are you coming home so late
these days?

336
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,810
You're not going to the study hall either.

337
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,150
What?

338
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Well...

339
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,620
What is it?

340
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,990
Are you hiding something from me?

341
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,050
Gosh, no.

342
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,860
I'm not hiding anything.

343
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,520
Then, tell me.

344
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,830
Why are you home so late? Where do you go?

345
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,330
Well,

346
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,700
I...

347
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,570
She's always late to school.

348
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,340
So she's been cleaning the restrooms
at school as her penalty.

349
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,170
What? Really?

350
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,310
Yes.

351
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,840
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

352
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,980
Why don't you go to school early?

353
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,950
Okay.

354
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,690
Da-jung.

355
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,690
But when will you be on TV again?

356
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,320
On TV?

357
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,630
I met my friends yesterday.

358
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,300
Everyone was asking about you.

359
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,870
They are so curious
about my anchorwoman daughter.

360
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,700
They wanted to know
what your next TV show is.

361
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,300
When will that be?

362
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,710
I did get an offer
to be on a show recently.

363
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,880
Really? Gosh. That's great.

364
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,250
But

365
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,610
the show is

366
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,250
about divorce.

367
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,260
I thought about it,

368
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,160
and I'm going to go on

369
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,230
that program.

370
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,200
Of course you should.
Were you planning not to?

371
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,270
Are you okay with it?

372
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,210
What's wrong with a program about divorce?

373
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,710
I'm okay with it too.

374
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,250
It's been a while since you appeared
in a new program,

375
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,190
so don't make things complicated
and just do your best.

376
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,090
Thank you.

377
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,830
- It's true.
- No way.

378
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,070
- Isn't he a baseball player?
- He is.

379
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,870
Aren't you Ye Ji-hoon?

380
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,710
Yes. Hello.

381
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,780
Why did you come out today?

382
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,550
The auntie who takes care of Seo-yeon

383
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,080
had something to do today.

384
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,920
- I see.
- Yes.

385
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,260
He's so handsome.

386
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,090
(Daram Kindergarten)

387
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,530
Jae-hyun!

388
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,970
Mom!

389
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,170
Da-eun!

390
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,640
Mom!

391
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,840
Goodness. Oh, my.

392
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,510
Seo-yeon!

393
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Come to Dad.

394
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,190
Seo-yeon.
It's dangerous, so let's hold hands.

395
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,630
Am I a kid?

396
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,180
Oh, you drew an alien.

397
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,420
You did a great job.

398
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,820
It's a goblin.

399
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,890
Don't you know what
"The Haunted House" is?

400
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,590
"The Haunted House"?

401
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
"The Haunted House".

402
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,330
Oh, this book looks fun.
Do you want me to read it to you?

403
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
Okay.

404
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,430
All right.

405
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,770
Okay.

406
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,140
"One day, the queen asked the mirror."

407
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,110
"'Mirror, mirror,'
'who's the prettiest girl in the world?'"

408
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,380
"'It's Snow White in the woods,
of course!'"

409
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,810
This is boring.

410
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,880
You're right.

411
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,150
This book isn't fun.

412
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
("Snow White")

413
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,920
Mr. Ye Ji-hoon.
We'll start on your makeup now.

414
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,160
Okay.

415
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,160
Seo-yeon. Wait here for a bit.

416
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,970
Can you close your eyes?

417
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Okay.

418
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,740
Did you wait for a long time? Follow me.

419
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,580
What are you doing here alone?

420
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,050
I was following Shinbi and Eunbi.

421
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,850
Did you get lost? Who did you come with?

422
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,520
My uncle.

423
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,260
Your uncle?

424
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, my. Jung Da-jung agreed to
go on a divorce program?

425
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,200
Yes, she did.

426
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,530
How could she do that?

427
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,300
If I were her, I wouldn't be able to.

428
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,470
I know. She's so tough.

429
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,810
(Getting a divorce isn't something
to brag about.)

430
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,380
I'm done with your makeup.

431
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,520
Thank you.

432
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,530
Mr. Ye Ji-hoon.
We'll start the shoot in 20 minutes.

433
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,730
Okay.

434
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,940
Seo-yeon.

435
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Seo-yeon!

436
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,140
Should we go to your uncle now?

437
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,180
Okay.

438
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,910
Oh, Mr. Ye.

439
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,720
Thank you, Ms. Jung.

440
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,350
Pardon?

441
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,690
Seo-yeon.
Where did you go without telling me?

442
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,090
I was worried.

443
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,460
My goodness.

444
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,700
You must be that difficult girl.

445
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,700
Kids at this age usually disappear
at the blink of an eye.

446
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,670
My kids were like that too.

447
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,980
If I think about back then,

448
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,650
it still makes me dizzy.

449
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,080
You were like that too?

450
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,150
Seo-yeon. Don't go anywhere this time,

451
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,350
and wait in the greenroom okay?

452
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,090
Gosh, it's boring.

453
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,630
Mr. Ye, we'll start the shoot.

454
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,830
Okay.

455
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
Let's go.

456
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,500
Mr. Ye. I'll watch Seo-yeon.

457
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,340
I have some time until you finish
your interview.

458
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,140
No, it's okay. That's...

459
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,510
I have some free time, so it's okay.

460
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,610
We'll be at the lobby cafe
on the first floor.

461
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,410
Seo-yeon.
Do you want to get some ice cream?

462
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,810
Yes! I want to go get ice cream.

463
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,250
I want to go.

464
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Okay.

465
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,860
Yahoo!

466
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,300
A lot of kids asked each other out
last year.

467
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,500
Will it happen again this year?

468
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,900
I wonder how many couples there will be this time.

469
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,500
Why are you so interested in
other people's dating lives?

470
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,670
Oh, my. Hong Si-a.
It's so obvious you never dated.

471
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,810
What? I never dated by choice.

472
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,440
I haven't met anyone I like yet.

473
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,980
Really? What kind of guy do you like?

474
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,550
Let's see.

475
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,650
Someone who's forward.

476
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,250
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

477
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,170
Why are you sitting here?
There are plenty of other seats.

478
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,470
I like this seat.

479
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,670
What are you saying?

480
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,350
Let's get ready for class.

481
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,690
I have an announcement first.

482
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,920
The duet performance assessment I assigned
at the beginning

483
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,620
of the semester will be next week.

484
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,990
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

485
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,660
- What?
- Did you start?

486
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,000
Woo-young, you don't have a partner
because you transferred.

487
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,100
Who is your closest friend?

488
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Si-a.

489
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,310
Who is Si-a's partner?

490
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,310
It's me, Bo-bae.

491
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,850
Then Si-a, Bo-bae, and Woo-young

492
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,650
can prepare a trio together.

493
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,650
Okay.

494
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,660
Hey, Go Woo-young.

495
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,160
Do you know how to play any instruments?

496
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,000
I played a bit of guitar back in the day.

497
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,600
Really?

498
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,440
Then try playing it.

499
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,380
It's been a while,

500
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,190
so I don't know if I'll do well.

Gosh, Woo-young is really good
at playing the guitar, right, Si-a?

502
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,310
You're right.

503
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,280
- Woo-young.
- Yes?

504
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,440
Can you play another song?

505
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,880

This question is from your fan.

525
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,880
Mr. Ye Ji-hoon.
What's your plan for the future?

526
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,050
I'd like to keep my game up until the end
of the season

527
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,850
and show only my best self to my fans.

528
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,760
Keep in mind that popularity is a factor
when we consider you for full contracts.

529
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,590
Bring your games up, everyone.

530
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,370
You got quite a lot of attention
for adopting your niece.

531
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,740
You're young and quite handsome,

532
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,170
so a lot of fans must be
disheartened by the news.

533
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,310
Excuse me?

534
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,780
We promised not to bring his niece up.
What should I do?

535
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,450
Goodness.

536
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,850
You have a child now,

537
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,320
but you must still want to get married
one day.

538
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,520
What do you look for in a woman?

539
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,390
What do I look for?

540
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,030
I wasn't expecting this question.

547
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,230
"'Buy an apple that'll grant you a wish!'"

552
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,770
Again?

553
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,480
Read it to me again!

554
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,980
Mr. Ye, did the interview go well?

555
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,050
Yes.

556
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,180
Did you have fun today?

557
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,550
Yes. Look at my hair!

558
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,650
Seo-yeon, you look beautiful!

559
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,820
I want some more ice cream.

560
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,560
You do? What do you want?

561
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,760
I'll get it for you.

562
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,630
I'll get it.

563
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,530
All right.

564
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,930
You know how to pay, right?

565
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,040
Yes.

566
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,880
I'll take one chocolate ice cream, please.

567
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,950
Okay.

568
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,790
She's even prettier with her hair braided.

569
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,520
Too bad I can't do that for her.

570
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,590
Braiding is hard for men.

571
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Thank you.

572
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,630
By the way,

573
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,360
congratulations.

574
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,060
Sorry?

575
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,970
I heard that you got into a program.

576
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,800
You're going to kill it this time again.

577
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,440
I wasn't going to take it,

578
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,010
but they love watching me work.

579
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,780
- Who?
- My kids,

580
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,480
although I heard it from someone else.

581
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,380
See?

582
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,950
I told you that your family would
support you.

583
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,590
So, Ms. Jung,

584
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,360
just be yourself.

585
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,930
Thank you.

586
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,610
Yes, sir? I'm here. Where are you?

587
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,140
Okay.

588
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,350
- I guess there's a public proposal.
- No way!

00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,020
Ms. Ok.

592
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,200
I thought you wanted to grab a coffee.
Why are we here?

593
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,430
Let's first go there.

594
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,600
There?

595
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,400
You didn't do that, did you?

596
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,340
Of course not.

597
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,940
What kind of a crazy man does that
at a park?

598
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,950
Why don't you sit on the bench over there?

599
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,380
- I'll bring the coffee over.
- Sure.

600
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,350
Take it all down.

601
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,560
Take it all down!

602
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,930
Thank you.

603
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,300
Ms. Ok, thanks for agreeing
to go on a date with me.

604
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,540
What do you mean, a date?

605
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,780
Remember how I asked you out for coffee
at the gym?

606
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,610
I just agreed

607
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,850
because you went through that day.

608
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,490
But you said that you thought I was cool.

609
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,550
I meant as a father,

610
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,160
not as a love interest.

611
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,600
Please kindly refrain
from such inappropriate behavior

612
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,260
and presents.

613
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,800
Why do you not like me?

614
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,140
If it's

615
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,640
because I'm a parent,

616
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,140
- I'm actually...
- You, sir,

617
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,710
are an anime fan.

618
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,050
I don't like anime fans.

619
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,590

You can have this.

625
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,820
I don't need it anymore.

Yes.

Ex-boyfriend?

634

Why would I date that pathetic guy again?

635
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,530
He's just being clingy!

636

to walk with you to your destination?

No, it's fine.

She grew up so fast.

668
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,010
She looks just like her mother
when she was young.

669
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,780
Hey, we're all dolled up today.
Let's take a selfie.

670
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,980
- Sure.
- Yes.

671
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,990
Gosh, what a shame.

672
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,420
- Our outfits don't show in the photo.
- Right.

673
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,690
Stand over there. I'll take one for you.

674
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,630
Great. Let's take one.

675

How do you want your photo?

677
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,400
Just take a lot of photos.
Make us look pretty.

678
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,440
Goodness. You're already pretty.

679
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,870
How can he just say something like that as if it's nothing?

680
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,480
All right. Here I go.

681
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,980
In 1, 2, 3.

682
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,380
Yes, that's it. All right. Look pretty.

683
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,380
- You look beautiful.
- Do we look good?

684
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,480
- That jerk.
- That jerk.

685
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,750
- You look pretty.
- I'm getting suspicious.

686
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,820
- That's it.
- Should we take another one?

687
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,790
Gosh.

688
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,020
It would have been great
if my kids were here to see this with me.

No.

I'm Singer Do Won-kyung.

- Who is she?
- It's been

729
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,280
- I don't know.
- a while since I'd been here,

730
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,380
so I'm nervous to sing.
