(7 years ago)

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,090
Come on!

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,260
I asked you to wake me up early today.

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,530
Oh, right. I forgot. I'm sorry.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,830
Nothing stays in your brain.
It must have so much space.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,410
Wait. Have breakfast before you go.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,740
Forget it. I'm late!

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,220
I see.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,460
Then, let me put you down
for 4 p.m. tomorrow.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,660
Yes. Okay.

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,900
All right. Let me check my schedule.

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,900
(My lady's birthday)

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,370
What?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,430
("My lady's birthday"?)

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,040
Gosh.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,070
I'm dead meat.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,790
Honey, happy birthday.

19
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,730
I love you.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,800
This morning, I thought

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,080
that my husband no longer loved me.

22
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,850
But I guess you still love me.

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,650
I'm sorry about this morning.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,280
I won't make that mistake again.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,250
And here you go.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,000
Here.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,270
That's beautiful.
It looks like my constellation.

28
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
Yes, it is your constellation.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,770
- Really?
- Yes.

30
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,370
All right.

31
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,550
Gosh.

32
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,220
If I could, I want to give you
the whole galaxy to you.

33
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,150
But this time,
I'll only give you the stars.

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,190
At this rate, you'll get me the moon too.

35
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,220
Of course. You just name it.

36
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,390
Look. It's a half-moon.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,170
Right. How beautiful.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,970
I like full moons.

39
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,140
Half-moons

40
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,910
look lonely for some reason.

41
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,180
Gosh. They aren't lonely.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,680
Even if you can't see it,
the other half is right next to it.

43
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,680
Just like your other half right here.

44
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,190
This is nice.

45
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,560
=Episode 12, Half-moon=

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,300
Let me see your face.

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,550
Dae-young.

48
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,490
What took you so long?

49
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,590
I've been waiting for you.

50
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,450
What?

51
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,570
Did I just kiss Woo-young in my dream?

52
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,470
Goodness! I must be losing it.

53
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,100
Get a grip, Jung Da-jung!

54
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,870
Gosh.

55
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Mom.

56
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,380
- Woo-young--
- Yes?

57
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,790
What's wrong?

58
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,850
What?

59
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,620
Nothing.

60
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,020
What about Woo-young?

61
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,490
I'm going to practice with him,
so I'll be late today.

62
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,500
Sure. I got it. Okay.

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm leaving now.

64
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,370
- Last night--
- Yes?

65
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,540
What? What happened?

66
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,040
Nothing.

67
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,180
You drank a lot last night.
Are you hungover?

68
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,550
I see.

69
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,350
Yes.

70
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,250
Chocolate milk will do the trick.

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,190
Are you a kid? Why would you cure your hangover with chocolate milk?

72
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,560
Chocolate milk always works best for me
when I'm hungover.

73
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,730
It was even on TV that it's the best hangover cure.

74
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,030
Si-woo took the last one we had left.

75
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,500
Is that so?

76
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,170
Have a seat.
I'll make you some bean sprout soup.

77
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,700
It's okay. I have a meeting,
so I have to go to work.

78
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,180
Mom.

79
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,880
Did someone

80
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,550
bring me home last night?

81
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,450
No. You came home alone.

82
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,390
Right?

83
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,770
Here. Drink this.

84
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh, my.

85
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,340
Woo-young. What are you doing here?

86
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,380
I came to go to school with Si-woo,

87
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,580
but he already left.

88
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,650
Drink this before the bus comes.

89
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm okay. You can drink it.

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,520
I have one for me too.

91
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,750
They said it was 1 plus 1,
and they gave it to me for free.

92
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,360
Okay. Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

93
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,970
(Chocolate Milk)

94
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,900
I enjoyed your show last night.

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,330
You were really good.

96
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,140
What? It was nothing.

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,540
It wasn't nothing.

98
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,140
You raise kids,
and you're great at your job too.

99
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,210
An accident almost occurred during a live
broadcast, but you handled it like a pro.

100
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,980
You were really cool.

101
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,830
What was so cool about it?

102
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,710
I want to be a mom
that Si-a and Si-woo will be proud of,

103
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,110
so I'm going to work harder.

104
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,240
You have to go further.

105
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,750
It's faster to transfer buses.

106
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
I'll get off first.

107
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,020
I guess she doesn't remember
what happened last night.

108
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,090
My gosh.

109
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,240
What are they doing
so early in the morning?

110
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,810
Jung Da-jung. Come to your senses.

111
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,610
That was just a dream.
Why do you keep thinking about it?

112
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,350
My goodness.

113
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Da-jung.

114
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,320
"Couples in Crises" will become
a regular program.

115
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,760
Congratulations!

116
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,260
Really?

117
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,530
It had the highest viewership ratings
among all the shows at that time.

118
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,330
If it becomes a regular program,
doesn't that mean it will keep airing?

119
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,640
Gosh, I don't know.

120
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,540
Your name has been
on the real-time search list all day.

121
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,270
You're really incredible.

122
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,910
Thank you everyone.

123
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,680
What's so great about being
on the real-time list?

124
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,120
Why? You were on the real-time list too.

125
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,690

129
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,070
You were so professional.

130

Thank you.

131
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,540
There are some malicious comments.
Will you be okay?

132
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,310
It's not like
I didn't expect such reactions.

133
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,750
I expected it before I started,
so I'll be okay.

134
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,980
I knew it.

I like you too.

What?

151

I had an idea that you liked me
when you yelled

152

at the scary man on the bus.

153
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,950
You kept looking at me during class,
and you smiled when you saw me.

154
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,290
You also complimented me
and took care of me.

155
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,060
I knew how you felt all along.

but if you knew the details,

160

this is a really inappropriate situation.

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,010
What?

170
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,250
Never mind.

171
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,950
We're going to be late for class.
Let's go.

172
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,310
What is this?

173
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,510
You look pretty enough.

174
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,890
Is that what it was?

175
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,860
He likes Si-a?

("Chemistry 1")

177
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,280
Hey, Woo-young.
You forgot to take this.

178
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,380
Oh, right. Thank you.

179
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,580
I should get ready.

180
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,820
Gosh, that's hot!

181
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,760
Why would you grab this
with your bare hands?

182
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,330
Come with me.

183
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,470
I'll clean it up, so cool your hand off
and go see the nurse.

184
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,010
It's fine. This is nothing.

185
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,070
My goodness.

186
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,380
My gosh.

187
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,250
Move. I'll clean it up.

188
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,190
Right. Thank you, Ji-ho.

189
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,290
Why are you grateful?

190
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,990
What?

191
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,560
What? Did something happen over there?

192
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
No.

193
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,380
This is a bandage for burns.

194
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,350
Thank you.

195
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
Are you

196
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,460
ill?

197
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No.

198
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Thank you.

199
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,770
- Could I get a bandage for burns?
- Sure.

200
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,310
Here you go.

201
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,550
Why won't he wait for me?

202
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Si-a!

203
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,150
What?

204
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,220
Have a seat over there.

205
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,930
What are you doing?

206
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,700
Give me your hand.

207
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
I said I'm fine.

208
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,000
It's nothing.

209
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,540
It's not nothing.

210
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,940
You're a girl.
How terrible would it be to get a scar on your hand?

211
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,410
Burns always leave scars. My gosh.

212
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,120
See? You already have a blister.

213
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,120
You didn't have to.

214
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,970
Are you okay?

215
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,670
My gosh. Here.

216
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,850
I'm fine. It's just a little burn.

217
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,010
It's not fine.
You should've used oven mitts.

218
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,350
Why did you use bare hands?

219
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,020
This isn't being cool,
this is just being stupid.

220
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,790
You got hurt because you weren't
careful enough!

221
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
My gosh.

222
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,320
Come on.

223
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,760
Can you stop nagging?

224
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,800
It's not nagging.
I'm just looking out for you.

225
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,770
We have no bandage for burns.

226
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,940
That's going to leave a scar.

227
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,470
Si-a, I'll go get some bandage, okay?

228
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,340
It's fine!

229
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,700
My answer was

230
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,730
always a no.

231
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,210
Do you like someone else?

232
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,910
Yes.

233
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,100
Why can't he be with Si-a?

234
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,640

That's so funny.

243
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,850
How touching.
They're being so considerate.

244

- Mr. Heo?
- Yes?

245

It's time.

247
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,360
We almost got busted.

248
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,800
Why is it so hard to have a drink
without Mr. Heo?

249
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
Exactly. He's so quick.

250
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,170
What do you think

about anchors that use their private lives

252
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,810
to get attention instead of using their talent?

253
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,450
Do you think such a person is fitting
to be a JBC anchor?

254
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,950
Did you read the comments?

255

I'm sorry.

259
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,930
I will

260
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,660
take responsibility for this and quit.

261

Yes, I read the article.

You did?

270
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,760
For now,

271
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,460
think long and hard about
how Ms. Jung would be as a full-time anchor.

272
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,990
Yes, sir.

There's nothing to say
when he gets no attention anyway.

All right. See you tomorrow.

That's a lot of calls
you're getting today.

284
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,690
You're the most popular one
on the whole team.

285
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,420
It's just temporary because of the show.

286
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,730
There was a time when I was that popular.

287

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,610
Yes, I am.

290
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,710
Why do you ask? Is something up?

No, there's nothing.

292

We're friends,

00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,180
My friend reserved under his name.
Go Deok-jin.

306
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,180
I see. I'll take you to your table.

307
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,090
What?

308
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,600
My father said that he wanted
to treat me to something good,

309
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,570
but he canceled on me last minute.

310
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,940
Is that right?

311
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,640
Hold on. Let me call Deok-jin.

312
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,920
(The person you have reached is unavailable.)

313
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,820
He's not picking up.

314
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,790
I guess we'll have to reschedule
for another time.

315
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,760
Let's head out.

316
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,400
We haven't ordered yet.

317
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,140
Mr. Go asked the restaurant to serve
the food in time for the reservation.

318
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,310
He has already ordered and paid
for the dinner.

319
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,510
He already paid?

320
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,590
That's too bad.

321
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,320
It'd be a waste of food if we left.

322
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,590
Why don't we just eat?

323
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,000
I guess we have to.

324
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,860
Let's eat then.

325
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,210
What a luxurious dinner we're getting
thanks to Deok-jin.

326
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,580
Look at me, slicing steak and all.

327
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
What is it?

328
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,960
Is there something wrong?

329
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,690
No.

330
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,760
It's melting in my mouth.

331
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,170
Let me give you some of mine.

332
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,340
No. It's all right.

333
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,870
(I had forgotten)

334
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,170
(that if I treat her like a gem,)

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,880
(she can shine so bright like now.)

336
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,610
You know what? We should

337
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,980
dine at that restaurant
over there one day.

338
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,220
I heard when you dine there at night,
the view is superb.

339
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,090
Da-jung, should we go there
on your birthday?

340
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,690
Really?

341
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,100
What should I wear to the restaurant?

342
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,900
Gosh. Should I wear a dress?

343
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,700
(I wanted her to be loved all her life.)

344
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,910
(But I used my busy life as an excuse)

345
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,080
(and made her)

346
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,220
(into my wife
and the mother of my children.)

347
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,240
What are you staring at?

348
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,140
How beautiful.

349
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
What?

350
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,410
I mean, the view here.

351
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,120
You're right.

352
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,990
It is beautiful in person.

353
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,690
Actually,

354
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,500
I've always wanted to come here.

355
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,160
(I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.)

356
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,930
(Take care of my son for me.)

357
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,340
(Okay. I'll enjoy the food too.
Thank you for the food.)

358
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,780
(I helped you out today. You owe me one.)

359
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,220
Your dad must be very busy.

360
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,850
I guess so.

361
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,800
- Hello.
- It was quite expensive.

362
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,030
- Hello.
- Hi.

363
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,700
See you later.

364
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,870
- Check out this place.
- Hi.

365
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,710
- I know.
- Exactly.

366
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,710
Ms. Ok. Where are you?

367
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
(Mr. Go. I'm sorry.)

368
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,390
(No matter how much I think of this,
I don't think this is right.)

369
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,790
(I will not answer your calls
regarding personal matters. Bye.)

370
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
What? Ms. Ok!

371
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,730
Ms. Ok!

372
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,410
Hello?

373
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,680
Gosh. My plan tonight just fell through.
I'm by myself.

374
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,650
- Do you want to join me?
- Now?

375
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,950
I'm not fit to be seen right now.

376
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,590
And has there been a time
when you looked presentable?

377
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,690
Don't be like that. Just come over.
I'll buy you a drink.

378
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,160
A drink?

379
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,860
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

380
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,260
- How could he wear that?
- Unbelievable.

381
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,770
I got dumped today.

382
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,970
No wonder. Just look at your outfit.

383
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,750
Did you not bring an umbrella?

384
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,650
It wasn't raining when I got here.

385
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,450
Is that so? Then, wait here.
Let me go buy one.

386
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Gosh.

387
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,460
I know you don't want to spend money
on umbrellas at the last minute.

388
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
What?

389
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,730
(How did he know that?)

390
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,430
Your house is on the way.
Let me walk you home.

391
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,800
And let me borrow your umbrella.

392
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,740
Okay. Let's do that.

393
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,710
Let me.

394
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,660
What? He left an umbrella.

395
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,040
Your shoulder is going to get all wet.

396
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,270
It's all right. This is nothing.

397
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,340
This is a small umbrella, isn't it?

398
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,310
Should we get a cab since it's raining?

399
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,480
It's fine.

400
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,420
You walk home when it's only
two stops away to save money.

401
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,520
(How does he know so much about me?)

402
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
Are you okay?

403
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,470
Yes. I'm fine.

404
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,440
Oh, no. You're completely soaked.

405
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,850
You can put these on. You'll catch a cold.

406
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,060
Okay.

407
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,930
Gosh.

408
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,630
Goodness.

409
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,430
I'll stay in my room.

410
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,260
Let me know once you're fully dressed.

411
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,550
Well, okay.

412
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,450
I'm at home, so I let my guard down.

413
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,600
Gosh. I can't believe
I'm wearing Si-woo's clothes.

414
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,010
Jung Da-jung, get a grip.

415
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,210
He's a student. And I'm a parent.

416
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,920
Why would you be flustered?

417
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,720
Goodness.

418
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,060
(Ye Ji-hoon)

419
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,470
Hello, Mr. Ye.

420
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,470
Ms. Jung. I'm in front of your house now.

421
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,310
Can I see you for a moment?

422
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,710
Pardon? In front of my house?

423
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,850
Were you waiting for me?

424
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,020
I enjoyed watching your show.
Congratulations.

425
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,960
That jerk. Why is he back here again?

426
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,230
Here.

427
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,470
This is a gift from your number one fan.

428
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,070
Gosh. I'm her number one fan.

429
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,570
Thank you. These are beautiful.

430
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,580
- Oh, right. This too.
- What's that?

431
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,510
Go Go Play is having an event.

432
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,150
I'm sure you got invited.

433
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,680
That's for your daughter.

434
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm having a signing event that day.

435
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,260
My daughter will love it.

436
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,830
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

437
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,340
What? Woo-young.

438
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,950
I heard you were friends with her son.
I guess you're here to see him.

439
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,880
Sure. Why not?

440
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,820
Are you coming to the event tomorrow too?

441
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,480
Your father's company is hosting it.

442
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,550
No.

443
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
You're not?

444
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,990
That's too bad.
It would be nice for you to come.

445
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,290
Gosh. Why would I go?

446
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,330
What do you mean? You're my fan.

447
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,660
Let's forget about my embarrassing past.

448
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,570
What?

449
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,540
You know how people change
who they like overnight.

450
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,180
Gosh, these flowers are so pretty.

451
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,050
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

452
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,250
I'm glad you like them.

453
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,250
Stop smiling at just anyone.

454
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,560
People will get the wrong idea.

455
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,090
What?

456
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I'll get going.

457
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,930
It's late, so you should go in soon.

458
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,930
You too.

459
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
What's wrong with him?

460
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,780
I think I know why.

461
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,780
You know why?

462
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,190
Yes.

463
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,450
What do you know?

464
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,220
Do you really not know?

465
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,190
That kid

466
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,460
likes you.

467
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,530
What?

468
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,100
Gosh, that's nonsense.

469
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,640
He's not at an age to consider things
and like someone.

470
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,620
I'm here, Si-a.

471
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,950
Welcome.

472
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,060
What's wrong? Did something happen?

473
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,430
What do you think about Woo-young?

474
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,970
Go Woo-young?

475
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,830
Do you

476
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,800
like Go Woo-young?

477
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,440
- I can't like him anymore.
- Why?

478
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,180
I confessed my feelings,
and he rejected me.

479
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,080
Woo-young likes you, Si-a.

480
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,150
What?

481
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,090
(I can't figure out how you feel.)

482
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,760
What do you mean you can't figure out?

483
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,760
It's obvious he likes you.

484
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,090
Right?

485
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,030
I'm not okay with it.

486
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,100
This is upsetting.

487
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,470
What are you staring at?

488
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,740
How beautiful.

489
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,510
(No way. Does Woo-young really like me?)

490
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,420
You'll catch a cold if you get rained on.

491
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,620
You look pretty enough.

492
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,750
You look beautiful.

493
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,820
Are you sure you're taking it well?

494
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,660
(Then that was all because he likes me?)

495
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,960
What's wrong with you two?

496
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,030
(Is it best to just avoid him?)

497
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,100
(How is that possible?)

498
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,510
(I bump into him every single day.)

499
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,140
(Hold on. Why am I contemplating this?)

500
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,380
(- Right. I'm sure he doesn't like me.
- Right. I'm sure he doesn't like me.)

501
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
(It's true that I like you, you fool!)

502
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,420
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my gosh!

503
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,290
You surprised me.

504
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,660
Why are you guys overreacting?

505
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,290
He made it so obvious that he likes her.

506
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,460
I'm going to my room to get some rest.

507
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,200
Me too.

508
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,210
What's wrong with them?

509
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,780
Go meet someone else.

510
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,990
I can't. I don't get butterflies
when I see other women.

511
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,250
Goodness. How is that possible?

512
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,560
It's true.

513
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,330
I don't get butterflies
when I see other women.

514
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,200
What will you do if I seduce you?

515
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,460
Will you give up on her?

516
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
Am I crazy to get seduced by you?

517
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,800
That will never happen.

518
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,240
Oh, is that so?

519
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,080
(If you got butterflies...)

520
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,090
But do you like that woman that much?

521
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,020
Saying I like her isn't enough.

522
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,490
Ms. Ok is too good for me.

523
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,100
What's wrong with you?

524
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,970
I think you're quite manly.

525
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,870
Me?

526
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,610
When you rescued me from my ex-boyfriend,

527
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,710
you looked really reliable.

528
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,950
I did?

529
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,590
It made me think that

530
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,620
I'd like to lean on you from time to time.

531
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,760
You're a good guy.

532
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,530
Be confident.

533
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,240
Okay. Thank you.

534
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,470
No need.

535
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,540
Excuse me for a minute.

536
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Oh, my.

537
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,970
(If you got butterflies, meet someone else.)

538
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,510
Hey!

539
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,240
Hey!

540
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,890
Hey, Chu Ae-rin.
How dare you try to seduce me?

541
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,560
You said you don't get butterflies.

542
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,930
But you fell for it.

543
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,890
No. It's not true!

544
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,000
Excuse me. The elevator stopped.

545
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,840
(Okay. I'll go right up.)

546
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,270
Goodness.

547
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,980
I can't breathe.

548
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,420
What?

549
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,050
I have a trauma.

550
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,520
Oh, my.

551
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,700
My friend isn't breathing. Please help us!

552
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,140
(Pardon? Then give him CPR.)

553
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,140
I don't want to!

554
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,940
(It will take some time for
the rescue workers to get here.)

555
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,270
(Hurry up and do it.
If not, he could die.)

556
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,730
Deok-jin. I'm sorry.

557
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,270
I really can't bring myself to do it.

558
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,170
What are we going to do now?

559
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,970
Are you okay?

560
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,540
What are you doing here?

561
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,110
Is this a dream?

562
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,210
Or am I dead?

563
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,710
What are you talking about?

564
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,750
Mr. Go.

565
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,720
Are you okay?

566
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,050
This is the hospital.

567
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,560
Ms. Ok.

568
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,700
Do you know how worried I was?

569
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,400
You were worried?

570
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,000
You should lie down some more.

571
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,600
The doctor said you need to get rest.

572
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,070
But how did you know to come here?

573
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,110
Oh, your friend called me

574
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,010
and told me that you suddenly collapsed.

575
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,310
My friend?

576
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,170
(Why is he here from so early
in the morning?)

577
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,600
(Is he really here because of me?)

578
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,070
(He's crazy!)

579
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,570
Hey!

580
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,840
- Hello.
- Hi.

581
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,420
(This won't do. I need to draw the line.)

582
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,650
What are you doing here so early?

583
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,360
Here.

584
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,430
What is this? Why are you giving it to me?

585
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,260
It's Si-woo's clothes
I borrowed yesterday.

586
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,460
You didn't have to bring them
so early in the morning.

587
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:02,800
That's unnecessary for both of us.

588
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,370
What's wrong with you?

589
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,470
(You're only here for that?)

590
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,370
(What a lame excuse.)

591
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,740
I'm late. I'll get going.

592
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,350
What's wrong with her?

593
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,590
She must be mad because she's late.
You should get to school.

594
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,790
- You can give that to me.
- All right.

595
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,190
Thank you.

596
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,730
(What is he doing here?
Is he here to see me?)

597
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,660
(He's crazy!)

598
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,300
Si-a, you're not late for once.

599
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,040
Why do you care if I'm late or not?

600
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,570
Why do you have to talk like that?
That's so mean.

601
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,780
(Why is he paying attention
to every word I say?)

602
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,410
(That's so overwhelming!)

603
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,380
You find everything mean.

604
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,020
What's wrong
with the mother and the daughter?

605
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,220
I'm sorry, did you wait for a long time?

606
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,490
Not at all.

607
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,400
- We'll be heading to school now.
- All right.

608
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,330
- See you later.
- Have a good day.

609
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,070
- Did you have breakfast?
- Not yet.

610
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,100
- You shouldn't skip breakfast.
- I'm hungry.

611
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,080
Those two look alike.

612
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Hello.

613
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,330
Hey, how did it go with the lady
last night?

614
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,660
It went well, right?

615
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,100
No.

616
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,160
No?

617
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,330
How did you ruin it this time?

618
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,040
It's nothing like that.

619
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,470
Why not?

620
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,280
You're so worried for me,

621
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,250
but we still can't date?

622
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,780
I'm sorry.

623
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,920
I've thought about it, and as a teacher,

624
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,520
it'd just be so morally wrong of me
to date a student's parent.

625
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,360
Please understand me.

626
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,490
I hope you get better.

627
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,340
That's so unfair!

628
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,040
You're not even a real parent.

629
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,980
Why can't you tell her the truth?

630
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,320
How can I do that?
What would that make of Dae-young?

631
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,320
Goodness.

632
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,120
Such a loyal friend you are.

633
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,720
Give up on her, then.

634
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,120
I can't do that!

635
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,130
There's no other way.

636
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,530
Just give up!

637
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,400
- I can't!
- Just give up!

638
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,500
No!

639
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,970
My love is sincere!

640
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,310
(Doors are closing.)

641
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,220
(No way! I didn't know Mr. Go
was so straightforward.)

642
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,680
(Exactly. Those two look great together.)

643
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,420
(Right? I hope things work out
between them.)

644
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,130
The preparation for the launch party
for the new game tonight

645
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,600
is going well, right?

646
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,730
- Yes!
- Yes!

647
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,030
Everyone from famous social media influencers

648
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,700
to our game's model, Ye Ji-hoon
will be present,

649
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,140
so please make sure everything is good.

650
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,970
- Yes.
- One more thing.

651
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,910
There will be an important event
at the party tonight.

652
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,310
What event?

653
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,210
Confession.

654
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,150
I'm going to make a proper confession.

655
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,290
Good luck, Mr. Go!

656
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,320
We'll help you out! You can do it!

657
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,460
Let's go!

658
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,030
- No more being single for Mr. Go!
- No more being single for Mr. Go!

659
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,130
- No more being single for Mr. Go!
- Thanks, everyone.

660
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,130
You'll finally have someone!

661
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,440
(Ms. Ok, please give me one last chance
to say something to you.)

662
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,480
(Please attend the party tonight.)

663
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,950
(Sparta: The King of War, A new world will open.)

664
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,760
Amazing!

665
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,800
Hello.

666
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,930
Good luck to the awesome game!

667
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,300
Nice to meet you.

668
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,640
Please give lots of support to Sparta
by downloading and playing the game!

669
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,010
Please give lots of support to Sparta by downloading and playing the game!

670
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,470
Enjoy the night!

671
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,910
This is so nice.

672
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,980
Look at Ye Ji-hoon!

673
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,570
Deok-jin sure knows how to throw a party.

674
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,310
He's one of the better ones
among all the anime lovers.

675
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,340
- Look.
- It's Ye Ji-hoon!

676
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,540
It's Ye Ji-hoon!

677
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:19,480
My goodness.
Ye Ji-hoon looks so hot in person.

678
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,780
He can destroy Persia
just with his entrance.

679
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:22,920
Is he that handsome?

680
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,360
You've interviewed him so many times,
and you haven't noticed?

681
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,860
- Look at him.
- Unbelievable.

682
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:31,090
If he wears a cape, he'd be Leonidas I.

683
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,660
"Sparta!"

684
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,400
Hey!

685
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,670
He's so handsome.

686
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,070
You look so much better in real life!

687
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,600
- Just look at him!
- He looks so good.

688
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,070
- What a good-looking man.
- Indeed.

689
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,280
- He looks great in the suit.
- You look great.

690
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,880
You look so handsome!

691
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,950
- He's smiling!
- He's so handsome!

692
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,920
- Hello, Ms. Jung.
- Hi.

693
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,420
Your photos look great.

694
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,630
- I'm a fan.
- Thank you.

695
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,460
All my fans are so beautiful.

696
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,330
He's a very honest man.

697
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,140
It's my boss.

698
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,510
Da-jung, I need to take this.

699
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,210
- See you later.
- All right.

700
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,680
What a fun friend you have.

701
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,350
And you look beautiful, as always.

702
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,190
You're being honest, right?

703
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,590
Of course I am.

704
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,790
My lips would be crooked
if I were lying right now.

705
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,230
I knew it.

706
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,940
Mr. Ye, it's time to head
to your signing event.

707
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
All right.

708
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,710
Enjoy the party.

709
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,290
Oh, my.

710
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,290
I thought he wasn't coming.
Why is he here?

711
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,240
Did she not see me?

712
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,140
Why is he following me around?

713
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,050
No, that's not it...

714
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,110
What?

715
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,080
No! She can't swim!

716
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,690
Gosh.

717
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,530
It's a really shallow pool.

718
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,810
Goodness.

719
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,910
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

720
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,080
Yes, I'm fine.

721
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,090
Yes.

722
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,180
Darn it.

723
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,320
You said you weren't coming.
But here you are.

724
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,950
I didn't come here to see you.

725
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,220
Then, did you come here to see Ms. Jung?

726
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,060
Of course...

727
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,760
Why does that matter to you?

728
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,200
It does

729
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,770
because

730
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,840
I like Ms. Jung.

731
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,780
If you're pursuing her
because you're undergoing puberty,

732
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,750
I hope you stop here.

733
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,670
Whatever.

734
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,910
Mr. Ye.

735
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,350
What you're seeing isn't everything.

736
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,420
Pick your match carefully.

737
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,330
Okay?

738
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
How cute.

739
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,920
I can't believe this.
I'll get to see Ji-hoon in person!

740
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,080
My heart is pounding so fast.

741
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,450
Right.

742
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,560
What? Woo-young is here too.

743
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,420
Woo-young?

744
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,790
Gosh, I was right.
He does have a crush on you

745
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,360
seeing how he followed you here.

746
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,800
Gosh, I told you he doesn't.

747
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,300
His dad's company is launching this game.

748
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:31,740
He's here to see his dad.

749
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,910
Don't deny it. It is so obvious
that he likes you.

750
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,380
Look at him. He's coming here.

751
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,480
- Give me a second, Bo-bae.
- Okay.

752
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,550
Let's talk.

753
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,560
What?

754
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,470
- Bo-bae.
- What? Hello.

755
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,530
Hi.

756
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,200
Well,

757
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:08,440
it's about what you just said. Is it true?

758
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,270
What did I just say?

759
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,310
I see. That Woo-young has a crush on Si-a?

760
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,680
Yes. Does Woo-young really like Si-a?

761
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,220
Yes. He takes
such good care of her at school.

762
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,750
He makes it so obvious.

763
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,420
Really?

764
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,730
No, Mother.

765
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,530
"Mother"? I get that you like Si-a.

766
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,900
How could you call me Mother
when you're still in school?

767
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,900
My gosh. I'm so silly.

768
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,340
It was a misunderstanding.

769
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,210
Woo-young. I'll be blunt.

770
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,480
Do you like me?

771
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,990
Of course, I do.

772
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,630
We're friends.

773
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,500
- "Friends"?
- Yes.

774
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,530
I knew it. I knew I was right.

775
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,840
Thank you.

776
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,170
"Thank you"?

777
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,380
Yes. Come to think of it,

778
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,510
you've been nice to me
on so many occasions.

779
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,150
I don't think I could have
a better friend than you.

780
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,220
On that note,

781
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,320
I hope we can be good friends here on out.

782
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:32,690
"Friends"?

783
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:33,990
Yes.

784
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,830
I'll try to be a good friend to you too.

785
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,530
(Si-a finally accepted me as her friend.)

786
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,170
(Not just any friend at that,
but a good friend.)

787
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,780
- I'll take photos now.
- How handsome.

788
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,140
(Sparta: The King of War,
A new world will open.)

789
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,110
- Gosh, this is amazing.
- Goodness.

790
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,120
- Hello.
- Hey.

791
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,450
You're here, Si-a.

792
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,520
You remember my name?

793
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,990
Of course, I do.

794
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,890
Did you bring your friend?

795
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,690
Yes. You got me the tickets,
so I brought my friend with me.

796
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

797
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,230
Let's go.

798
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:17,740
He's so hot!

799
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,170
Gosh. I don't get
why Si-a likes that jerk so much.

800
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,150
Woo-young.

801
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,790
Can we talk for a moment?

802
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,770
I'm sorry

803
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,540
for treating you so harshly this morning.

804
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,850
You took care

805
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,850
of Si-a when she was sick.

806
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,120
And you helped Si-woo
with his basketball too.

807
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,760
Whenever I was feeling down,
you comforted me.

808
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,690
You were always nice to me.

809
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,900
I'm sorry.

810
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,670
And

811
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,140
thank you.

812
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:28,570
Don't mention it.

813
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,880
Did I

814
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,580
offend you in any way?

815
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:36,810
No.

816
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,090
Just because.

817
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:43,720
When I see you,

818
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,320
I'm reminded of my past.

819
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:53,430
Did you

820
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:58,000
hate me because I resembled Mr. Hong?

821
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,440
"Hate"? No.

822
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,010
How could I?

823
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,840
He's someone I ought to apologize to.

824
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,550
Don't you

825
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,320
resent Mr. Hong?

826
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,990
No way.

827
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:24,830
There are so many things
I can thank him for.

828
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,140
What?

829
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,340
It's a Half-moon.

830
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,610
Yes, it is.

831
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,620
It's exactly half.

832
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,750
It's been a while

833
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,890
since I saw a Half-moon.

834
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,930
I hope

835
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,270
the other half is doing okay.

836
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,210
Even if I can't see it,

837
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,390
I hope it's doing well.

838
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,170
I would like to

839
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,110
(Epilogue)
I would like to

840
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,210
thank everyone for coming
to the launch party of Sparta,

841
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,750
Go Go Play's new game.
Thank you, everyone.

842
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,120
Today's event is over.

843
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:32,760
But there is a very special event.

844
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,290
- Gosh.
- I am going to

845
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:38,000
publicly confess my feelings
to someone at this very event.

846
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,170
As all of you here know,

847
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,040
I'm a huge fan of games.

848
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,210
In other words,
I'm what you call, a successful fan.

849
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,640
People around me were
very concerned about me

850
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:53,210
as I was a hardcore gamer.

851
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,850
They were worried that
I was too caught up in my own world

852
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,580
and that I might not be able to
love anyone.

853
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,050
But

854
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,290
you changed me.

855
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:07,320
I was so comfortable
living in my own world,

856
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,660
but thanks to you,

857
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,500
I was able to come out
into a bigger world.

858
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:16,370
I still have a lot to learn,

859
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,600
- but I want to make an effort for you.
- That's so cool.

860
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,740
Please go out with me.

861
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:26,740
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

862
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,110
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

863
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,980
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

864
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,190
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

865
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,560
- Well...
- What are you doing here?

866
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,870
Exactly. Why am I here?

867
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:51,170
- Accept it!
- Accept it!

868
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,770
Ms. Ok...

869
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:57,270
- Ms. Ok!
- Hey!

870
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,440
Wait.

871
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,610
I think we messed it up.

872
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,010
Oh, no. What do we do?

873
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,480
Ms. Ok.

874
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,480
Ms. Ok, wait.

875
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,820
Is that why you wanted me to come?

876
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:11,090
- It's not what you think.
- Of course, it is.

877
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,660
You have it all wrong!

878
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,790
There must have been a misunderstanding.

879
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,500
He and I have been friends for 20 years.

880
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,400
We're practically like brothers.

881
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,200
And I'm rooting for you two
to become a couple.

882
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,910
- Is that true?
- Of course.

883
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,440
When you got up on the stage,

884
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,710
I was going to give this ring to you.

885
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:36,910
That's...

886
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,880
It was hard,
but I got it from a collector.

887
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:40,750
This is the Reality Stone.

888
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,720
Dr. Strange has the Time Stone.

889
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,690
The Soul Stone is on Vormir Planet.

890
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,820
Shush.

891
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,860
What's this about?

892
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,680
Is that Ms. Jung?
