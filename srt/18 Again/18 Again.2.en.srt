165
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,890
Please start.

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,230
There has been news that a nameless angel

167
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,000
in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province

168
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,400
has been doing good deeds
for the past 12 years.

169
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,970
According to the Gunsan City Hall,
on the 17th of last month,

170
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,770
an anonymous donator came,

171
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,510
gave them an envelope with
a receipt for 20,000 briquettes,

172
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,910
and left without saying anything.

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,520
Breaking news.

174
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
This morning, the Special Judicial Police

175
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,420
inspected companies that
provide school meal services.

176
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,290
However, it has been reported that
they found fruit flies, mold,

177
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,630
and feathers in some of the companies.

178
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,060
She knows about this.

179
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,660
- I know.
- They put students...

180
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,530
She's better in practice than theory.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,730
This act is more heinous than
any form of violence.

182
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,140
- I'm sorry.
- It is necessary for

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,810
the government to act promptly
regarding this situation.

184
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,140
I apologize for

185
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,980
the sudden static during our broadcast.

186
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,650
Please be understanding.

187
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,650
Gosh, she's very good.

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,820
She's quite good.

189
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,290
Ms. Jung Da-jung?

190
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,820
How did you come up with the last comment?

191
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,030
I thought of this as an actual broadcast
and said what came to mind.

192
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,060
She's quite skillful.

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,300
I shouldn't ask her age, right?

194
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,840
Of course not. It's a blind test.

195
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,940
What class were you in?

196
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,040
Oh, right.

197
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,280
I'm in the class of '11.

198
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,150
Then she's around 28.

(Serim High School)

202
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,760
Don't tell the others.

203
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,630
If they find out you helped me,
they'll try to get revenge.

204
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,270
What? Target me?

205
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,470
You should be careful too.

206
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,040
Be careful?

207
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,810
Is this

208
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,010
how you act in school?

209
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,950
Do you understand how serious
the situation is?

210
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,720
I don't play dirty and attack people
through social media or play politics.

211
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,390
I can chew you up and spit you out
without much effort.

212
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,690
What? Chew me up?

213
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,830
Be honest.

214
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,840
You put down some bait
before you transferred, right?

215
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,100
Did you think that I'd be scared
if you bought liquor

216
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,570
at a convenience store and threw a fit?

217
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,310
Your younger brother Si-woo...

218
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,110
Did you look into my background too?

219
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,620
Did you know that Si-woo
was getting bullied?

220
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,720
What?

221
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Hong Si-woo got bullied again?

222
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,650
Did you know that already?

223
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,220
If you knew that,
you should've told your dad!

224
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,890
Do you tell your dad things like that?

225
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,260
If you don't tell your dad,
who would you tell?

226
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,100
How dare you keep talking about my dad?

227
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm warning you.

228
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,630
You better not show your face
around me anymore.

229
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,280
(Are you really my daughter, Si-a?)

230
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,610
(I love you, Dad.)

231
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,620
Dad, be strong!

232
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,850
I love you.

233
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,890
Okay. I will be strong. I love you, Si-a.

234
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,230
(You used to be so kind.)

235
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,480
(That can't be her.)

236
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,910
(My daughter must be somewhere else.)

237
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,030
How was I? Did I do a good job?

238
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,060
Yes. You seemed like a real bully.

239
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,660
I wouldn't have been able to do it
without you guys.

240
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,330
I was scared at the convenience store.

241
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,070
But Go Woo-young seems nice.

242
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,670
Did he really do that?

243
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,910
You think that anyone who's handsome
is nice, don't you?

244
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,340
Hold on.

245
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,680
Gu Ja-sung picked on Hong Si-woo again?

246
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,550
Darn it.

247
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,360
Why are you getting bullied?

248
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,360
Mind your own business.

249
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,460
If you were trapped,
you should've screamed for help.

250
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,770
Why did you stay quiet?

251
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,070
Why would I scream?

252
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
That's embarrassing.

253
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,200
Embarrassing?

254
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,710
What's embarrassing?

255
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,880
People like your older sister are the ones
who should be embarrassed by themselves.

256
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
What?

257
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,210
Don't talk about it if you know nothing.

258
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,300
Is it him?

259
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,640
Don't look him in the eye.

260
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,310
I told you. Don't look at him.

261
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,060
Si-woo, is this your new friend?

262
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,200
A loser has friends too,I guess.

263
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Hey!

264
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,550
Come here.

265
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Give me the ball.

266
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
The ball?

267
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Sure.

268
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,520
You

269
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,990
need a good lesson.

270
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,170
How are you going to teach me?

271
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,170
First,

272
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm going to call your father.

273
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,490
That's very old-fashioned of you.

274
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm also going to report you
to the Bullying and Harassment Committee

275
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
and tell them that you're bullying
your classmate.

276
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,330
Not only that, you're being cowardly
and using your friends to do it.

277
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,030
What do you know?

278
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,000
I know everything.

279
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,440
Kids who hit their growth spurts
earlier than everyone else

280
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,840
and bully others
just because you're taller and bigger.

281
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,380
I've seen a lot of those.
Tall and big but immature.

282
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,820
You think life is going good for you

283
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,450
because your peers are scared of you,
right?

284
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,590
What you don't know is

285
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,720
that you just look like a fool
begging for people's attention.

286
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,220
Maybe,

287
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,530
are you still a kid down there too?

288
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,950
Dare to say one more thing.

289
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,810
Apologize.

290
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,220
- What?
- Apologize.

291
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,290
- How dare you...
- Stop!

292
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,820
Eat up. Your food is getting cold.

293
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,550
Alright.

294
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,230
This is infuriating.

295
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,930
How dare they bounce a basketball
on someone's precious child?

296
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,470
I wish I could beat him up as my old self.

297
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,820
I haven't been there

298
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,950
in a very long time.

299
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,430
What was that?

300
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,770
Choi Il-kwon, you think you can become
a basketball player like this?

301
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,280
Come here, Go Deok-jin.

302
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,980
Should I?

303
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Thank you.

304
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,590
You all don't want to play
in the next game, do you?

305
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,160
What? You're going to snitch on us
to the coach?

306
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,560
Why would I do that when I can
sort it out here?

307
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,900
You annoying punk.

308
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,170
Get it together!

309
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,370
That was me back in the days,

310
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,070
but I'm the one going there to smoke now.

311
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,780
How funny.

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,030
Hey!

313
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,130
My goodness.

314
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,100
I thought you were a teacher.

315
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,170
What?

316
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,410
- Hong Si-a, you!
- Stop right there.

317
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,280
I told you to not make yourself seen
in my eyes.

318
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,150
- You smoke now?
- Hey.

319
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,810
You shouldn't be the one to talk.

320
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,420
You're here to smoke too.

321
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,620
What is with the attitude?

322
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,720
What's wrong with you?

323
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,390
What?

324
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,930
I'm talking to you!

325
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,090
How rude!

326
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,730
- What?
- What?

327
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,900
You look familiar.

328
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,040
Choi Il-kwon?

329
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,040
What? Choi...

330
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,510
How dare you call your teacher
by his name?

331
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,110
You're a teacher now?

332
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,380
"You're a teacher now"?

333
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,550
What do you think you're doing, you punk?

334
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,720
Well...

335
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,420
I'm a new student here.

336
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,120
A new student?

337
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,360
You're a new student,
and you're smoking on your first day?

338
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,090
A student shouldn't be smoking!

339
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,000
Come with me to the Teacher's Office.

340
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,640
Why would I go? I didn't even smoke.

341
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,200
What's in your hand, then?

342
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,310
I didn't smoke, I'm telling you.

343
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,210
See? It's still wrapped.

344
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,580
Look at these punks.

345
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,750
Who smoked these?

346
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,550
There must be others who smoked with you.

347
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,460
If you tell me who smoked,

348
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,230
I'll let you off the hook.

349
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
- Okay?
- What?

350
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,630
Goodness.

351
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,870
What do you mean, you didn't smoke?

352
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,340
You punks did not only smoke,

353
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,040
but are lying too?

354
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,010
How can students smoke at school?

355
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,950
(She's not going to listen to me
when I look like I'm her age anyway.)

356
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,690
(Si-a, this is the only way for you
to learn your lesson!)

357
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,020
I know it may look cool,

358
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,260
but it'll all come back at you in the end.

359
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,290
You're right.

360
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,260
Please keep scolding us so that we learn our lesson.

361
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,300
Sir, we have some equipment delivered
to the school,

362
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,470
- so I'm going to go downstairs.
- Sure.

363
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,770
Go Woo-young, why are you getting up?

364
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,310
I've already made a deal with Mr. Choi.

365
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,370
Right?

366
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,480
Right.

367
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,510
Please teach Woo-young and Si-a

368
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,450
a good lesson.

369
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,480
All right.

370
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,980
You punk.

371
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,250
What?

372
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,750
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

373
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,230
Have a seat!

374
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,630
Yes, sir.

375
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,800
Why are you giving a side-eye?
You're in trouble too.

376
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,140
You're a woman!

377
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,470
How dare you smoke
and from such an early age too?

378
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,470
What will you do when you grow up?

379
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,910
Sir, please do not hit her.

380
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,120
Although smoking was inappropriate of her,

381
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,890
you can certainly scold her
just with words.

382
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,820
You don't need to beat her.

383
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,190
And "You're a woman"?

384
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,860
That's highly inappropriate
for this day and age, don't you think?

385
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,060
Sorry, I was wrong.

386
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,130
It's fine.

387
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,230
All right.

388
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,700
- Ms. Ok,
- Yes?

389
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,640
you're Woo-young and Si-a's
homeroom teacher, right?

390
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,970
- Yes.
- Call their parents right now!

391
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,810
What? I'm sorry!

392
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,850
- Sir...
- What are you doing? Call them!

393
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,450
All right.

394
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,080
You punks.

395
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,590
How dare you try to teach me a lesson?

396
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,060
The new Gogo Play's theme

397
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,560
and Ye Ji-hoon's image go well together.

398
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,060
We could certainly attract

399
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,470
- the public's eyes.
- I miss her.

400
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,070
So cute!

401
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,270
I didn't know he was your type.

402
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,940
(Baseball Player Ye Ji-hoon)

403
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,850
Look at that guy.
He's the second-cutest guy after me.

404
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,120
All right. Then, I'll take it
that you agree with our decision.

405
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,660
I'll offer Ye Ji-hoon to be our game model
for our new commercial.

406
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,860
Ye Ji-hoon?

407
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,130
You just said he was cute.

408
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,600
If every cute guy models for commercials,
I'll be the model.

409
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,900
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

410
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,440
Our game targets female players.

411
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,940
How can we hire a player to be our model?

412
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,740
Gosh, you guys don't know anything
about what women want.

413
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,310
He's the most sought-after model by female players.

414
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,910
(Number 1, Ye Ji-hoon)

415
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,410
And he's the most sought-after guy
to go to the amusement park with.

416
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,050
He's also the most sought-after guy
to introduce as a husband on holidays.

417
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,820
Is that so?

418
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
(Oh, My Teacher)

419
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,300
This is the legend that scored 10 million
downloads within the shortest time period.

420
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,170
This is the CEO of Go Go Play,
Go Deok-jin.

421
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,000
Yes, Ms. Ok.

422
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,570
I see. Okay.

423
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,080
I got it.

424
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,310
Then, let's contact Ye Ji-hoon
for the commercial.

425
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,280
I have an important meeting.
I'm heading out.

426
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,780
Go home when you're done.

427
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,120
(- Doors are closing.)
- Lawyer Chu.

428
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,660
Chu Ae-rin.

429
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,890
Don't talk to me in that outfit.

430
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,330
Our offices are in the same building.
Don't be a stranger.

431
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,430
I especially want to be

432
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,870
a stranger to you
when we're in this building.

433
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,970
Gosh.

434
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,500
I'm nervous.

435
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,440
Of course. An outfit like that
will make anyone nervous.

436
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,610
No. I'm on my way to see
my kid's homeroom teacher.

437
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,280
Have you gone mad?

438
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,720
You don't have a kid.

439
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,250
I do. I have an annoying 18-year-old son.

440
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,120
Are you serious?

441
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,920
Are you telling me there's a boy
who has the same DNA as you?

442
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,630
If he takes after you, it's a disaster.

443
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,960
It's a disaster for him
and for this world.

444
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,930
My gosh. You and your jokes.

445
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,540
Thanks to you, I don't feel nervous.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

446
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,240
Yes. That's more like him.

447
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,610
Wait. He has an 18-year-old son?

448
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,720
Ms. Jung.

449
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,660
Hello, Ms. Ok.

450
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Did Si-a

451
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,280
cause trouble at school?

452
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,250
Si-a was caught smoking, ma'am.

453
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,090
Smoking?

454
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,290
She had this electronic cigarette.

455
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,190
Where did you get this?

456
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,330
It's my mom's.

457
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,370
It is mine.

458
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,710
Wait, that doesn't mean I'm a smoker.

459
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,870
What a colossal mess!

460
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,680
Woo-young, watch your language. Sit down.

461
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,610
Listen to them. The mom and the daughter
share the electronic cigarette.

462
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,380
Why must I just sit here
and listen to this?

463
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,780
You smoked too.

464
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,550
You and I are different!

465
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,150
How are we any different?

466
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,290
Guys.

467
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,600
You look just like him.

468
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,240
Ms. Jung?

469
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,340
Ms. Jung, you can't do that
to another student.

470
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,970
Nowadays, this can be a huge problem.

471
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,680
She's right, Mom. Don't touch him.

472
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,410
Who does he look like?

473
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,910
Look at him.
He looks just like your father.

474
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,620
What? Who?

475
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,890
- Dad?
- Yes.

476
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,450
Your dad, Hong Dae-young.

477
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,060
Take a good look at him.

478
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,460
- Come on.
- Ms. Jung.

479
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,860
- Ms. Jung.
- Mom!

480
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,230
Hold up!

481
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,470
Mr. Go?

482
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,610
We meet again.

483
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,320
I had my son without getting married.
I'm a single dad, Go Deok-jin.

484
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,520
Deok-jin?

485
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,350
Hey, Da-jung.

486
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
But

487
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,960
you had a son?

488
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,930
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

489
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,130
Right. He's my son.

490
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,870
He's your son?

491
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,070
You guys should go back to class.

492
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,840
Okay.

493
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,680
- Bye.
- Bye, son.

494
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,780
Why don't we go to the counselor's office?

495
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,880
Okay.

496
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,280
(Counselor's Office)

497
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,620
Thank you for coming today.

498
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,790
You did all the work, Ms. Ok.

499
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,760
Ms. Ok, I'm sorry.

500
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,460
I'd like to treat you to a meal
as a way to apologize for my son.

501
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,860
I'm on a diet.

502
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,370
Then, how about coffee?

503
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,970
I'm allergic to it.

504
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,350
It's you, isn't it? Jung Da-jung.

505
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,980
And you're Go Deok-jin.

506
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,580
Hi, Il-kwon. What are you doing here?

507
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,490
I'm the physical education teacher here.

508
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,220
It's so nice to run into you here.

509
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,990
You too, Deok-jin.

510
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,130
What's wrong with him?

511
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,000
I guess he still hates me.

512
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,070
Pardon?

513
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,770
What I did to him back then was wrong.

514
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,310
Anyway, it's been so long.

515
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,780
Right. You didn't come
to any of the school reunions.

516
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,480
Right.

517
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,850
Had I known that you'd be there,

518
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,920
I would've attended one.

519
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,470
Si-a, everyone is coming.
Are you sure you're not coming?

520
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,200
No, I'm sorry. I have to work
after I stop by home.

521
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,840
Are you working again?

522
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,240
What is it now?

523
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Why do you have a part-time job?

524
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,680
Why do you care?

525
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,780
You're a student. If you need money,
ask your parents for money.

526
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,980
Why are you trying to make money already?

527
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,220
There's something I want to do.
Are you happy with my answer?

528
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,630
- See you tomorrow.
- Hey, Ji-ho.

529
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,230
Did you know Si-a had a part-time job?

530
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,670
- Yes.
- How?

531
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,910
I just knew because we're friends.

532
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,080
Because you're friends?

533
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,880
Then, you must also know
why she's working.

534
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Yes.

535
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
But that's not my story to tell.

536
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,120
Ji-ho, what are you doing? Hurry up.

537
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,190
Okay.

538
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,290
- Bye.
- Hey.

539
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,760
My gosh. Goodness. Come on.

540
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,380
Those punks.

541
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,200
Si-woo, are you really
not going to play basketball?

542
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,800
You were good when you were younger.

543
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,030
I'm not interested.

544
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,740
He said he wasn't interested.

545
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,150
(My son)

546
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,000
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Si-woo. Where are you?

547
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm at home.

548
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,570
Home?

549
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,830
(Yes, I'm at home.)

550
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,470
(- Why?)
- Why do you think?

551
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,870
I just called to see how you were.

552
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,480
Are you really uninterested in basketball?

553
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,110
Be honest.

554
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,950
(If you want to play, I'll support you.)

555
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,880
I'm not interested.

556
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Really?

557
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,120
Hey, Si-woo.

558
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,360
(How's school?)

559
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,930
Is everything okay?

560
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,130
Does anyone pick on you?

561
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,700
(No, no one does.)

562
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,500
Why are you asking me that today?

563
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,070
No reason. I was just curious.

564
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,940
Hey, Si-woo.

565
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,610
(Yes?)

566
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,810
If you have anything to tell me,

567
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,850
you can tell me anytime.

568
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm always on your side.

569
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Okay.

570
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,620
Hey, Hong Si-woo.

571
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Go Woo-young?

572
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
You're pretty good.

573
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,060
But I'm pretty good at basketball too.

574
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,530
Stop bluffing.

575
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,160
What's with that tone?
Don't you believe me?

576
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,540
Okay. Pass me the ball.

577
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,620
Did you tell Mr. Go or my dad about me?

578
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,590
No.

579
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,690
Why would I tell them that?

580
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,060
Then do me a favor and don't tell them.

581
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay. I'll do that.

582
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,500
How long have you been playing basketball?

583
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,500
Since a while back. Just for fun.

584
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,610
That means you're interested in it.

585
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,480
Who said I wasn't interested?

586
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Hong Si-a.

587
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,390
Come sit here.

588
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,050
Why did you take this?

589
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,350
I thought you were throwing it
because you didn't smoke it.

590
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,020
If I don't smoke it,

591
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,920
does that mean you can?

592
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,460
Why can you do it, but I can't?

593
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,830
You're a minor.

594
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,330
I'll be an adult in two years.

595
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,260
What would be so different then?

596
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,660
I'm all grown up.

597
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,530
Si-a. An adult...

598
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,270
There isn't much difference between
being 18 and being 20.

599
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,740
Why are you stopping me?

600
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,540
My goodness. If you smoke and
do everything you want at 18,

601
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,680
what will you do as an adult?

602
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,680
Don't worry.

603
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,050
Regardless of what happens,
I won't live like you.

604
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,950
Hey. Why do you think I live like this?

605
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,320
Are you saying it's because of me?

606
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,990
Did I ask you to give birth to me?

607
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
What?

608
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,180
I've lost my mind.

609
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,540
Why did I even buy that?

610
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,050
(Electronic Cigarette, 110,000 won)

611
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,460
What are you looking at?

612
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,260
I'm thinking about buying
an electronic cigarette.

613
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,230
I told you to quit smoking.

614
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,160
What kind of pleasure would I have
in life if I quit smoking too?

615
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,770
Quit smoking. I'm warning you.

616
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,870
Fine.

617
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,820
It looks like you've had a lot to drink.
You should stop.

618
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,890
Let go!

619
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,220
You're the worst!

620
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,600
I should've thrown it out
with Hong Dae-young.

621
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,340
Why do you keep following me?

622
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,140
Hey, can you help me practice?

623
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,940
- Help you practice?
- Yes.

624
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,580
I want to join the basketball team
at school,

625
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,410
and I need someone to practice with.

626
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,920
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

627
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,950
If your hobby is playing basketball,
why not play with me too?

628
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,050
I don't want to.

629
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,390
Mom.

630
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,860
Hey, Si-woo.

631
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,560
You're Deok-jin's son, right?

632
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,070
I'm sorry about what happened today
in the Teachers' Office.

633
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,000
What is she sorry about?

634
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,700
Right. The thing is...

635
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,480
I'm really disappointed.

636
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,080
How can you smoke
after what happened today?

637
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,380
What? Woo-young, this is...

638
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,390
I have no idea what you're thinking.

639
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,650
Hold on.

640
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,360
Is that any way to speak to an adult?

641
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,930
And why do you keep speaking down to me?

642
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,600
I have my reasons to do so.

643
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,230
What?

644
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,570
To be honest, I...

645
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,270
I...

646
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,910
I'm your husband, Hong Dae-young!

647
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,540
I almost said that to her.

648
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,080
Because I was so angry.

649
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,380
To be more exact,
you're her ex-husband, Hong Dae-young.

650
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,210
Hey. I'm not divorced yet.

651
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,350
So? What did you say?

652
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,460
I...

653
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,930
I lived abroad for a long time,

654
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,890
so I'm not good at using honorifics.

655
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,030
Then you must be good at English.

656
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,270
I can't, because I lived in Koreatown.

657
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,540
You should've just told her
you were Hong Dae-young.

658
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,880
It's because of our kids.

659
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,350
Your kids? Why?

660
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,800
After seeing them today,

661
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,240
I realized I didn't know a lot about

662
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,740
Si-a or Si-woo when I was their dad.

663
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,450
But...

664
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,520
What about your future?
Is there anything you want to do?

665
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,350
No.

666
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,290
You're a student. If you need money,
ask your parents for money.

667
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,190
Why are you trying to make money already?

668
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,190
It's because
there's something I want to do.

669
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,470
Si-woo, are you really
not going to play basketball?

670
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,030
I'm not interested.

671
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,000
How long have you been playing basketball?

672
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,970
Since a while back. Just for fun.

673
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,480
That means you're interested in it.

674
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,980
Who said I wasn't interested?

675
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,330
They told Go Woo-young,
someone they met today,

676
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,830
things that they never told
Hong Dae-young,

677
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,370
who raised them for nearly 20 years.

678
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,640
The person my kids need right now

679
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,980
is not Hong Dae-young the father,

680
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,950
but their friend from school,

681
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,610
Go Woo-young.

682
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,220
Yes, I need Go Woo-young

683
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,990
more than Hong Dae-young right now too.

684
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,330
Will you shut it?

685
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,110
Jung Da-jung!

686
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,750
What brings you here? You never come out.

687
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,120
I just need a drink.

688
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,550
- Excuse me.
- Yes!

689
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,260
I'll take your order.

690
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,660
Choi Il-kwon?

691
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,430
Jung Da-jung!

692
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,970
Choi Il-kwon?
The Choi Il-kwon from high school?

693
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,500
Chu Ae-rin!

694
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,070
It's so nice to see you.

695
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,170
Hello.

696
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,770
What are you doing here?

697
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,970
My older brother runs the bar,

698
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,180
and the part-timer skipped,
so he needed an extra hand today.

699
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,480
You're looking good.

700
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,280
You're being too kind.

701
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,020
Choi Il-kwon!

702
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,250
I can't believe that you ran into him
at school of all places.

703
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,150
I have to go there
if I want to meet Ms. Ok more often.

704
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,160
Dae-young, what do I do?

705
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,760
He probably grew up
now that he's a teacher.

706
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,130
You should let the past be past too.

707
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,630
You think Choi Il-known grew up?

708
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,600
You think people change that easily?

709
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,130
All right.

710
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,550
Hey,

711
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,420
feel better.

712
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,650
So your kid smoked. That's no big deal.

713
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,760
Smoking is an issue,

714
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,360
but I've just been so busy
with the divorce

715
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,430
and interviews.

716
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,630
I feel like this happened
because I didn't take care of them enough.

717
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,740
I've raised them for 18 years,

718
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,470
but it's still hard.

719
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:49,710
I'm fired. My husband and I divorced.

720
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,020
Did you say divorce?

721
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,290
Da-jung, did you get a divorce
with Dae-young?

722
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,030
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

723
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,330
It's fine.

724
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,630
Divorce isn't a big deal
in this day and age.

725
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,770
It's getting late. I should go.

726
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,170
Hey, I just finished my shift too.

727
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Let's go together. I'll drop you off.

728
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,980
No, we don't live far from here.

729
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,480
That's great, then.

730
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,680
Wait for me outside. I'll get my car.

731
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,620
Da-jung, Il-kwon
still seems like he's into you.

732
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,190
What are you talking about?

733
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,600
His first love!

734
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,700
It's you!

735
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,800
That's all in the past.

736
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,770
I hope you end up falling
for a divorced woman with kids!

737
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,250
I know exactly what that is.

738
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,220
The guy cheated on her.

739
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,180
What's wrong with a divorced woman
with kids?

740
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,490
Let's go.

741
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,710
Everyone seems like they're happy.

742
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,450
You still feel sad after drinking?

743
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,220
Even after all the drinks,

744
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,120
my life is still the same.

745
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,650
Your issue is
that your life is still the same?

746
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,660
I know a secret to life.

747
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,890
A secret to life?

748
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,490
You want to know?

749
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,200
First, open your shoulders wide.

750
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,600
Close your eyes,

751
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,840
and take one step at a time,

752
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,310
while imagining that you're the coolest
and fiercest woman in the world.

753
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,750
Count to ten, then open your eyes.

754
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,420
When you open your eyes?

755
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,750
Date the first man you see in sight.

756
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,320
How do you expect me to do that?

757
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,460
Can you stop taking the fun
out of everything?

758
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,990
Just give it a try!

759
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,830
You can do that all you want.

760
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,800
Sure.

761
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,000
Keep laughing at how others live
their lives,

762
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,510
and keep living your life full of regrets.

763
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,440
You're right.

764
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,380
My life is pathetic.

765
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,150
I have no right to judge others.

766
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,220
Let's try your way of living.

767
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,490
Da-jung! Are you finally coming out
of your shell?

768
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,860
Shoulders open.

769
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,800
Here I go.

770
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,340
(One,)

771
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,280
(two,)

772
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,210
(three...)

773
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,350
It's going well.

774
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,190
Honey!

775
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,290
Really?

776
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,330
(Five.)

777
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,240
(I've been living my life)

778
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,710
(all wrong.)

779
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,080
Your job is so easy for you, isn't it?

780
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,680
You think I'll be a little kinder to you
just because you have kids?

781
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,920
(At work.)

782
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,590
(Six.)

783
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,060
(Yes, I regret it!)

784
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,160
You do too.

785
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,500
Don't you?

786
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,270
(In my marriage too.)

787
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,800
(Seven.)

788
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,110
Are you saying it's because of me?

789
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,340
Did I ask you to give birth to me?

790
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,180
(As a mother to my children.)

791
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:17,950
(Eight.)

792
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,690
(I've been living my life)

793
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,490
(all wrong up to this point.)

794
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,220
(Nine.)

795
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:30,960
(Ten.)

796
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,450
Are you okay?

797
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,290
What?

798
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,760
Yes.

799
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,530
You have to be careful.

800
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,360
Yes.

801
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,420
You reek of alcohol.

802
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,850
Sorry.

803
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,060
Goodness.

804
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,940
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

805
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,040
Then please get out of my way.

806
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,390
Goodness.

807
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,690
What happened?

808
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,630
Did he save you?

809
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,230
Da-jung, hop in.

810
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,640
Go Woo-young, what are you doing here?

811
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,640
Mr. Choi? What are you doing here?

812
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,850
Why do you ask? I met my old friends.

813
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:02,950
Get home.

814
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,410
Okay.

815
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,720
How old are you?

816
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,850
I'm underage.

817
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,450
I see.

818
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,660
Da-jung, get in the front.

819
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,130
Wait!

820
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,130
Give me a ride too. It's getting late.

821
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,400
Sure. It gets dangerous at night.

822
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,840
You're fine with that, right, Il-kwon?

823
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Well,

824
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,310
Okay, I guess.

825
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,430
How long have you been friends?

826
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,700
Oh, us? We went to the same school.

827
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,930
We both went to Serim High.

828
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,330
They are more than school friends.

829
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,940
Il-kwon, your first love was Da-jung.

830
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,840
Ae-rin, come on.

831
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,150
(Go Deok-jin)

832
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,750
(Slide to answer)

833
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,490
- Yes, Dad.
- Where are you?

834
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,990
I'm sorry to make you wait.
I'm on my way home.

835
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,320
You went to smoke a cigarette.
Why are you going home? Hey, you!

836
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,890
Yes. I love you too.

837
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:24,930
Hey!

838
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,300
Hey!

839
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,770
You show your affection to him.

840
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,670
Deok-jin must be a loving dad.

841
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,840
What?

842
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,010
Deok-jin is your dad?

843
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,850
Wait, that Go Deok-jin?

844
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,450
It would be more believable
if he were Hong Dae-young's son.

845
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,850
He looks just like Dae-young.

846
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,490
Right? When I first saw him,

847
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,760
I was so shocked because
he's the spitting image of Dae-young.

848
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,660
Hong Dae-young?

849
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,680
Gosh, what are you talking about?

850
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,710
He's way more handsome than Dae-young.

851
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,080
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back for a second.

852
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,650
Right?

853
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,250
You guys are ridiculous.

854
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,120
Woo-young, look at this guy.

855
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,320
This is the guy they're talking about.

856
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,130
He can't even hold a candle to you.

857
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,190
I see.

858
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,800
Look at him.
You look nothing like him. Right?

859
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,070
You look totally different.

860
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,240
Don't think about how he looks now.

861
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,910
Try to remember when he was young.

862
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,070
Doesn't he look like Dae-young?

863
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,840
He resembles
the younger version of Dae-young.

864
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,580
And he was an awesome basketball player.

865
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,710
Hey, that's all in the past.

866
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,810
I don't know
how kids get so tall these days.

867
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,520
If Dae-young and I were to join
the basketball team now,

868
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,220
we might end up warming the bench.

869
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,990
Gosh.

870
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,890
Only those players who got lucky

871
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,160
to become the first-stringer
wouldn't be able to make it.

872
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,830
A key player like Dae-young
who was always a first-stringer

873
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,000
is a different story.

874
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,100
Gosh.

875
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,430
How do you know that?

876
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,100
That he always made the first string.

877
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,800
Well, I learned

878
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,170
basketball from Dae-young.

879
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,480
Dae-young taught you
how to play basketball? Why?

880
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,110
Because

881
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,220
my dream is becoming a basketball player.

882
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,490
I see. That's your dream?

883
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,560
He has the same dream as Dae-young.

884
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,570
Why are you getting off?

885
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,810
Because I want to.

886
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,080
Hey, Woo-young.

887
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,580
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

888
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,350
I'll take a cab.

889
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
Really?

890
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,350
Okay, then. Go straight home.

891
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,850
Bye, Da-jung.

892
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,660
Thank you for the ride.

893
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,160
Bye.

894
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,540
Wait. Let me get you a cab.

895
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,240
I can go home by myself.
You should go inside.

896
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,680
No. It's dangerous.

897
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,350
It's more dangerous for you
than it is for me.

898
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,180
- Bye.
- No.

899
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,220
I know

900
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,520
you drank.

901
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,460
What?

902
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,660
I didn't say anything
because Il-kwon is your teacher.

903
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,300
I smelled alcohol from you.

904
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,440
I won't tell you not to drink
because it will

905
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,140
worry your dad.

906
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,540
At that age,

907
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,970
nothing that your parents tell you

908
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,540
sounds important.

909
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,210
But Woo-young,

910
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,450
you said you wanted
to be a basketball player.

911
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,850
Then, you shouldn't drink or smoke.

912
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,390
Earlier in the car,

913
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,660
you said that Dae-young always
made the first string.

914
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,800
Do you know how he did that?

915
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,000
Practicing every moment he had
was a given.

916
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,900
He neither drank nor smoked.

917
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,500
I know it well
because I've seen it myself.

918
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,940
I know how hard he worked
to achieve his dream.

919
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,520
If you're serious about your dream,

920
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,490
no matter how hard it gets,

921
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,920
I hope you'll take good care of yourself.

922
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,400
Sorry. That was a long lecture.

923
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,660
I bet you didn't like that.

924
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,500
No, I like it.

925
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,830
It sounds like you care about me.

926
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,970
It's been a while since I heard that.

927
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,770
Really?

928
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,310
Then, it feels rewarding for me.

929
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,950
Wait. There.

930
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Taxi.

931
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,330
Here. Please drive him home safely.

932
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,230
Get in, Woo-young.

933
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,900
(Available)

934
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,470
Woo-young.

935
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,100
I'm sorry for nagging you again.

936
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,210
Cigarettes are really bad for athletes.

937
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,710
So quit smoking.

938
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,910
I'll quit too.

939
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,650
Okay. You should go home now.

940
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,730
As if.

941
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,370
Da-jung said
the electronic cigarette was yours.

942
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,000
What are you talking about?
I don't have an electronic cigarette.

943
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,070
She bought it for you as a present.

944
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,240
But she had no idea
Si-a would take it and smoke it.

945
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,380
She bought it for me?

946
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,220
(I will be)

947
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,520
(the only one who'll have to quit.)

948
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Hey, it's been a while.

949
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,890
- Hey.
- Hey, Il-kwon.

950
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,250
What took you so long?

951
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,550
I'm sorry.

952
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,020
I was going to come right after work,
but I happened to

953
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,230
run into my first love.

954
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,160
I see. Your first love?

955
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,700
Is she pretty?

956
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,900
Well, you know,

957
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,730
she's still beautiful.

958
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,790
(If you're serious about your dream,)

959
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,290
(no matter how hard it gets,)

960
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,690
(I hope you'll take good care of yourself.)

961
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,430
(I see. That's your dream?)

962
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,030
He has the same dream as Dae-young.

963
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,970
No. I really thought that
Dae-young was back for a second.

964
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,250
Where did you go this morning?

965
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
I exercised.

966
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,180
I must be in tiptop condition

967
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,220
if I'm going to play basketball
and take care of my kids.

968
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,790
Nice. Hey, do you have a cigarette?

969
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,460
I threw all of them out.

970
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,660
From now on, I won't drink or smoke.

971
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,940
Let's see how long that lasts.

972
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,500
Score! I got a package!

973
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:39,070
Da-jung.

974
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,410
What brings you here this morning?

975
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,220
You.

976
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,230
Hong Dae-young.

977
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:14,740
(5 months ago)

978
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,910
(Epilogue)

979
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,220
Bye.

980
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,390
- Si-a.
- Dad.

981
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,920
You didn't answer your phone.
Where have you been all night?

982
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,390
Where do you think?
I was in the study hall.

983
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,430
You're drinking again?

984
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,970
Well, I just wanted to have a drink.

985
