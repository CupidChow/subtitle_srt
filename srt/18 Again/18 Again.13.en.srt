00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,410
(3 years ago)

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,880
Da-jung, I have been

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,920
proposed to.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,350
Really?

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,220
Congratulations.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,860
But I'm not going to marry him.

7
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:17,460
Why not?

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,930
There are no butterflies.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,100
- What?
- I want my heart to flutter

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,130
even in my last moment.

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,870
I want my heart to pound fast.

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,340
Ae-rin, if your heart
keeps pounding like that,

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,610
you'll die.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,610
And all those butterflies

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,510
go away once you get married.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,480
You don't get any butterflies
in front of Dae-young?

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,090
What kind of wife would get
butterflies in front of their husbands?

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,590
It's been so long that I forgot
how it felt to have my heart fluttered.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,670
=Episode 13, Man That Makes My Heart Flutter=

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
What?

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,670
It's a half-moon.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,380
Look. It's a half-moon.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
I like full moons.

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,050
Half-moons

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,920
look lonely for some reason.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,160
Gosh. They aren't lonely.

27
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,700
Even if you can't see it,
the other half is right next to it.

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,529
Just like your other half right here.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,170
This is nice.

30
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:41,380
It's been a while

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,720
since I saw a half-moon.

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,790
I hope

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,630
the other half is doing okay.

34
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,170
Even if I can't see it,

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,370
I hope it's doing well.

36
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,150
Is that Ms. Jung?

37
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
My gosh.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
I...

39
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,510
Da-jung.

40
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,480
Da-jung, just now--

41
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,550
Please.

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,020
Don't ask me any questions.

43
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,460
Wait.

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,190
Da-jung!

45
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,570
Da-jung.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,970
Are you going home now?

47
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,440
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

48
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,610
Okay.

49
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,630
Taxi!

50
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,230
What will you say to her?

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,500
I'll tell her everything.

52
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,200
That I'm Hong Dae-young.

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,770
What? Why all of a sudden?

54
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,870
I can't lie to Da-jung anymore.

55
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,810
Exactly. Why do you want to
tell her the truth now?

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,980
Because

57
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,580
I love her.

58
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,860
I don't know anymore.

59
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,170
We're almost there.
Let me drop you off at your house.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
I just want to walk for a bit.

61
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,750
Did something happen?

62
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
Pardon?

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,090
Earlier,

64
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,760
I saw Go Woo-young running after you.

65
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,530
Did he--

66
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,290
No. Nothing happened.

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, thank you. Get home safely.

68
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,430
You...

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,160
I know I surprised you,

70
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,370
but let's talk for a moment.

71
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,540
I don't have anything to say to you.

72
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,370
Please listen to what I have to say.

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,710
What are you doing? Let go of me.

74
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,610
Please listen to me for a moment.

75
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Let go of her.

76
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,720
Ji-hoon.

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,090
This has nothing to do with you,
so stay out of it.

78
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,959
There's a limit to what you can
get away with because you're young.

79
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,200
If you keep crossing the line,

80
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,800
especially if you're doing this
to Da-jung, I won't stay still.

81
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,870
You won't stay still?

82
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,940
Who are you to say that?

83
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,080
The third-party should stay out of it.

84
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,550
Don't talk to him like that.

85
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,450
He's my boyfriend.

86
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,220
Stop lying.

87
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
It's not a lie.

88
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm Da-jung's boyfriend.

89
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,940
Let's go.

90
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,630
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,940
I made you lie for no reason.

92
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,640
Lie?

93
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,110
About

94
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,680
being my boyfriend.

95
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,580
It's okay.

96
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,420
I can be your real boyfriend.

97
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,890
What?

98
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,790
I'll be your boyfriend

99
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,230
in front of that kid.

100
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,200
That's the only way he'll give up.

101
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,270
I saw you earlier,

102
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,840
and it seemed you couldn't handle him
on your own.

103
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,209
I'm embarrassed that you saw that.

104
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,150
Thank you for everything today.

105
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,750
I'll go in now.

106
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,430
What on earth happened?

107
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,570
(The person you have called...)

108
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,740
That's odd.
Why isn't she picking up the phone?

109
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,780
(Ms. Ok. I called to see)

110
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,350
(if you were free
for some coffee tonight.)

111
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,390
(Jung Da-jung)

112
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,060
Why is she calling?

113
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,960
- What?
- Where are you?

114
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,430
Da-jung said that she's coming
to my office to meet with me.

115
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,000
What? Okay. I'll be right over.

116
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,780
What brings you here in the morning?

117
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,850
The thing is...

118
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,190
I thought we needed to talk about
what happened yesterday.

119
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,160
What happened yesterday?

120
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,860
I'll apologize for
what happened yesterday.

121
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,300
I should've been careful as an adult.

122
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,570
From now on, that will never happen again.

124
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,210
Oh, right. From now on.

125
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,810
(Oh, My Teacher)

126
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,210
(Mr. Go. This is Ok Hye-in.)

127
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,380
(I'm texting you back after realizing
the distance between us last night.)

128
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
(I will draw a clear line from you
from now on.)

129
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,290
From now on...

130
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,320
What?

131
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,230
I'll be careful from now on.

132
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,760
(With Woo-young kissing your friend,)

133
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,170
(I don't think it's appropriate
for us to meet each other.)

134
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,930
(We should each focus on Woo-young
from now on.)

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,940
(With that in mind,
any personal calls from you)

136
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,710
(will be blocked.)

137
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,650
Because of that punk's kiss...

138
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,980
I'm sorry. You're really upset, right?

139
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,290
This is nonsense.

140
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,620
This doesn't make any sense.

141
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,190
I know that it doesn't make any sense.

142
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,730
I'm really sorry.

143
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,600
- I will never do that with your son...
- Who's my son?

144
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,140
That punk isn't my son!

145
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,880
I know you're mad, but don't worry.

146
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,410
I drew a clear line,

147
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
- so your son--
- I said he's not my son!

148
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,320
He's really not my son.

149
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Deok-jin is really mad.

150
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,660
He is?

151
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,830
Why is he mad?

152
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,260
Of course he's mad.

153
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,800
He's a parent too.

154
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,340
What?

155
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,710
(Hong Dae-young. You said you would
tell her everything. What happened?)

156
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,110
Ae-rin, do you remember the girl
you spoke about before?

157
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,010
The crazy idiot whose heart fluttered

158
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,110
when she saw a high school student.

159
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,920
That girl got rid of her feelings.

160
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,590
But why are you bringing that up now?

161
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,360
I realized

162
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,660
that the crazy idiot was me.

163
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,330
What are you talking about?

164
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,700
To be honest, my heart fluttered

165
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,500
for Woo-young.

166
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,770
You crazy...

167
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,540
I'm sorry. I wasn't talking about you.

168
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,080
(Hong Dae-young, you crazy idiot.

No.

170
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,150
You can curse me out.

171
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,020
Even I think I'm a crazy idiot.

172
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,520
Da-jung.

173
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
The truth is...

174
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,490
Right. It's my fault.

175
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,460
I should draw a line starting right now.

176
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,000
I should tell him that I'm a parent
and he's a student.

177
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,270
I'll get going now.

178
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,710
Da-jung!

179
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,840
Right.

180
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,050
If I see him again,
I'm going to draw a clear line.

181
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,210
Are you okay?

182
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,780
Of course I am.

183
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,850
That's not important.

184
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,450
I wanted to...

185
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,360
Are you really okay?

186
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,720
Don't worry about it.

187
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,790
That's not what's important right now.

188
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,290

Fine. Let's talk.

192
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,150
You know that

193
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,390
your behavior yesterday
was inappropriate, right?

194
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,360
- I know you're upset, but...
- If my behavior

195
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,860
made you have a misunderstanding,

196
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,730
I'll apologize to you as an adult.

197
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,230
But from now on,

198
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,860
I don't want to see you again.

199
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,640
If we end up bumping into each other
by chance like today,

200
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,440
let's avoid each other.

201
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,770
Wait. Hold on.

202
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,780
This isn't a request. It's a warning.

203
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,880
If you don't do as I say,
your father will talk to the school,

204
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,050
and we'll come up with other arrangements.

205
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,650
So keep that in mind.

206
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,390
Hold on.

207
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,420

I want to attend his alma mater too.

230
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,550
I see.

231
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,220
But your grades are...

232
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,360
- I want to major in modeling.
- Sorry?

233

I'm 161cm tall.

I'm going to model
for the Milan Fashion Week.

But since I have to go anyway,

240
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,250
can you recommend me a school
with a pretty campus?

241
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,360
Aren't you hot?

242
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,220
Not at all.

Not yet.

It's great that you have a clear idea
of what you want to do,

but I want you to discuss this

What? How did you know?

256
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,320
I had a meeting with Ms. Ok after you.

257

Sure. It's no secret anyway.

It's frustrating that people only think of that.

267

It's much more than that.

Da-jung, she totally ignored us,
didn't she?

285

It must be because there are
so many people.

a video of you.

You're all new anchors, right?

Nothing good will come out
of messing with me.

305
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm so sorry, Mr. Yang.

306
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,450
They're all new, so they must've
not recognized your face.

307
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,610
Please understand them.

308
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,850
You've embarrassed me
in front of all these people,

309
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,720
and you want me to understand you?

310
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,520
What are you doing? Apologize to him now!

311
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
- I'm so...
- Don't apologize!

312
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,830
Check his phone, and if it's not true,

313
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,330
you can apologize to him then.

314

- My goodness!
- Look at her!

318
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,410
You know that this is a crime, don't you?

319
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,180
- You better let go!
- Should we stop them?

320
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,890
Are you serious?

321
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,560
What's this?

322
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
She twisted his arm!

323
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,300
- How did she do that?
- She's so strong!

324
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,200
- How could he do that as a producer?
- Hey!

326
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,800

327
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,270

Oh, my. What's wrong?

330
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,210
Did you hurt yourself?

331
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,650
I guess my shoe broke.

332
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,750
That's bad.

333
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,790
Aren't those from your number one fan?

334
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,830
It's fine. I can go to
a shoe repair shop later.

335
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,730
Do you have shoes to change into?

336
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,030
Yes, I do. I'm fine.

337
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,630
Why didn't you just let me apologize
and end it?

338
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Sorry?

339
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,010
He's the producer that grades us.

340
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,810
Ms. Kwon,

341
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,910
even if he was the CEO of this company

342
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,650
and not just a producer,

343
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,380
you're still the victim.

344
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,720
Why should the victim apologize?

345
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,250
But still.

346
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,390
What if he gets back at us for this?

347
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,720
Ms. Kwon,

348
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,160
you really think
you should be saying that?

349
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,390
But still.

350
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,560
I did it because I was reminded
of my daughter.

351
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,960
Your daughter?

352
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,100
If my daughter was

353
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,770
in the same situation,

354
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,640
and nobody was helping her out,

355
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,480
I feel like it'd have traumatized her
for life.

356
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,680
That's why I did what I did.

357
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,950
If I was being nosy,

358
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,150
Yu-mi!

360
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,630
I'll get going first.

361
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,700
How can she not even thank you?

362
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,100
It's fine.

363
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,840
She must be upset about the incident.

364
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,180
Let's not scrutinize her.

365
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,510
Fine.

366
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,460
(Ye Ji-hoon)

367
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,330
Ji-hoon!

368
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,460
Hello.

369
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
You're doing quite well these days.

370
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,030
I enjoyed your interview.

371
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,140
Thank you.

372
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,340
Just one thing,

373
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,510
do you have a crush on that news anchor?

374
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,080
- Sorry?
- You know,

375
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
Kwon Yu-mi. Right?

376
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,650
- No.
- Come on. What do you mean, no?

377
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,550
When I watched your interview, I knew
you were talking about Kwon Yu-mi.

378
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,050
Focus on your game.

379
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
You know that a lot of pitchers
allowed me to hit a home-run

380
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,590
because they were occupied
with their love life, right?

381
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,790
We, baseball players,
must be good at playing ball.

382
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,530
I'm telling you. It's her.

383
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,930
See? I told you.

384
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,410
He's the fourth pitcher of Daehan.

385
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,350
Kang Sin-woo is walking
to the batter's box.

386
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,610
It's a face-off between

387
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,750
the star pitcher and the star batter.

388
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,190
Given the moment
Kang has been building lately,

389
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,920
even Ye must be under a lot of pressure.

390
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,100
Strike.

391
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,140
Strike.

392
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,750
Strike. Out!

393
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,290
We, baseball players,
must be good at playing ball.

394
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,830
(That was a phenomenal game.)

395
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,070
(Seum wins the match against Daehan.)

396
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,140
(Ye was able to strike out Kang right away.)

397
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,240
- Hey.
- I'm not giving it to you.

398
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,480
- Dad.
- You can call me whatever you want.

399
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,840
I said no.

400
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,580
Mr. Go, I'm here.

401
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,320
Si-woo, do you want
to eat ramyeon with me?

402
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,390
No.

403
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,590
Forget it.

404
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,260
I'll cook for you, Si-woo. Wait.

405
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,360
Okay.

406
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,640
(- Seum! Seum!
- Seum! Seum!)

407
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,480
(- Strike!)
- My gosh.

408
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,350
Ye Ji-hoon is so good.

409
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
(The final score is...)

410
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,550
I'm not rooting for his team,
but he is so cool.

411
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,320
(Ye Ji-hoon leads the team
to their first win against Daehan.)

412
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,990
(Through this game, Ye showed us)

413
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,930
(his talent once again.)

414
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm really glad that
our program was well-received.

415
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,770
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Jung.

416
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,640
Gosh. I didn't do much.

417
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,470
It was all you.

418
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,940
So you heard that our show
will be a regular show now, right?

419
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
Yes.

420
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,710
All right. You guys can go home now.

421
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

422
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,720
(It's "Couples in Crises", a live talk show)

423
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,190
(- that has never been done before.)
- It's the preview.

424
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,060
(My goodness!)

425
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,100
(- Oh, my.
- Oh, no!)

426
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,930
(Countless requests to make it a regular show)

427
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,600
(So we are back again.)

428
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,600
Look. It's the preview.

429
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,270
(And here is)

430
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,550
(our new MC, Actress Kim Bit-na.)

431
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,450
This isn't right! Da-jung saved the show!

432
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,850
Exactly.

433
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,450
People watched the show for her!

434
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,160
This has to be Da-jung's show.

435
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,890
How can this happen?

436
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,160
(Check out her new challenge in our regular episodes.)

437
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,600
I thought my mom would be the MC

438
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,370
if the show became a regular show.

439
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,850
I really kept pushing
that you should be the MC.

440
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,850
But the higher-ups told me to change it
to someone with more popularity.

441
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,790
That was the order.

442
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,960
I am so sorry.

443
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,530
I understand.

444
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,760
Really?

445
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,300
Even so,

446
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,000
I am a bit disappointed.

447
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,070
Of course.

448
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,970
You worked really hard for our show.

449
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,540
Not about that.

450
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,310
Then...

451
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,480
I understand that last-minute notices
are common in TV industry.

452
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,450
But I think you should have told me

453
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,120
that you were getting a new MC beforehand.

454
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,850
This is

455
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,390
the least you can do for a colleague
who worked hard alongside you.

456
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,960
It's uncomfortable to bring this up,

457
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,800
but I thought I should address this.

458
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,470
I'll get going then.

459
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,780
Da-jung.

460
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,020
What? Ji-hoon.

461
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,290
What brings you here?

462
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,790
Must you ask?

463
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,490
I'm your boyfriend.

464
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,260
Pardon?

465
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,600
(And here is)

466
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,000
(our new MC, Actress Kim Bit-na.)

467
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
Are you here

468
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,670
to comfort me?

469
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,440
You comforted me
when things were tough for me too.

470
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,620
Allow me to return the favor.

471
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,120
There's somewhere we must be.

472
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,050
I see. But I have to

473
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,590
be somewhere too.

474
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,060
Do you have plans again?

475
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,530
No, I don't.

476
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,830
I have to get my shoes repaired.

477
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,200
What a relief.

478
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,100
Then, we can stop by the shop.

479
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,400
Nice.

480
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,340
How dare you?

481
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,910
What do you think you're doing?

482
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,710
I'll take this with me.

483
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,320
Hey, Mr. Ye.

484
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,520
You must be scared that
there might be a scandal.

485
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,650
A scandal?

486
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,790
Most of the articles you wrote about me are all false.

487
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm sure you know that better than anyone.

488
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,170
If I were to sue you for defamation,

489
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,140
who will read your articles, then?

490
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,040
- Are you threatening me?
- Yes.

491
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,670
This is a threat.

492
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,340
If you write a word about Da-jung,

493
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,410
I will sue you and your agency.

494
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,150
Consider yourself warned.

495
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,950
I won't let it slide this time.

496
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm sorry for making you wait.

497
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,600
No, it's fine. I like waiting.

498
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,480
By the way, I noticed that
you wear dress shoes more often.

499
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,480
Had I known, I should have
bought you dress shoes, not sneakers.

500
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,920
The shoes
I dropped off were from my number one fan.

501
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,920
Weren't they from you?

502
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,390
From your number one fan?

503
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,960
Gosh. I had competition.

504
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,700
They really weren't from you?

505
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,970
No. They aren't really from me.

506
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,170
Really?

507
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,970
Then, who are they from?

508
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,080
By the way, where do we need to go?

509
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,789
We've been here before.

510
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,789
Right.

511
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,789
Back then, it was a bit chilly.

512
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,959
So much time has passed since then.

513
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,030
Back then,

514
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,700
there were a lot of
cherry blossom flowers.

515
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,070
Do you remember making a wish here?

516
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,689
Hey, did you see that?

517
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,289
What's your wish?

518
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,990
It's a secret.

519
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,230
I remember.

520
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,260
Did the wish you made back then come true?

521
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,230
Can you give me your hand?

522
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,910
I'll give you my wish.

523
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I wished

524
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,000
that you would only smile in the future.

525
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,570
I really like it when you smile.

526
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,940
After what happened to my brother,

527
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,380
I had nobody beside me.

528
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,880
There was no one to listen to me

529
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,450
or worry with me.

530
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,660
Is there a person that comes to mind
when you're struggling?

531
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,690
A person that comes to mind
when I'm struggling?

532
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,570
(It's okay.)

533
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,070
You did well.

534
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,140
It's okay.

535
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,710
You did well.

536
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,290
Whenever something happens to me these days,

537
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,120
you're the first person that comes to mind.

538
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,260
I want to be that kind of person to you.

539
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,330
I want to be the first person

540
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,230
you think of when you're struggling.

541
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,370
I want you to be happy.

542
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,940
I will

543
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,210
make you happy.

544
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,150
I like you, Da-jung.

545
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,930
I'm sorry, Ji-hoon.

546
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,570
You're a really good person.

547
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,640
But this is

548
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,880
not because of you.

549
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,990
Is it

550
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,150
because of him?

551
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,490
I'm sorry.

552
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,430
I'll get going now.

553
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
(Are you okay?)

554
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
About what?

555
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,910
I saw the preview.

556
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,680
They changed the MC.

557
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,210
So?

558
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,450
I was worried.

559
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,850
Don't pretend like you're worried.

560
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,150
What?

561
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,590
You were

562
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,330
never by my side when I was struggling.

563
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,600
You never came to court,

564
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,230
(and when our kids were sick,)

565
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,670
(you said it wasn't a big deal.)

566
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,000
You suddenly called to say you wanted to meet,

567
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,710
but you never showed up.

568
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,180
(- I know you're not in Busan,)
- That was because...

569
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,940
(so don't even think about lying to me.)

570
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,380
Even though we split up,

571
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,420
we spent half of our lives together.

572
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,360
I didn't realize it before,

573
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,990
but I guess that time

574
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,130
was significant to me.

575
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,960
(Whenever something good)

576
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,860
(or something bad happens to me,)

577
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,270
you were always the first person
to come to mind.

578
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,040
But what about you?

579
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,210
You were never there for me.

580
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,180
(- So)
- Da-jung.

581
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,220
don't call me acting like you're worried
out of obligation.

582
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,150
I'm hanging up.

583
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,590
I was always next to you.

584
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,860
What?

585
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,000
I was next to you.

586
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,140
Stop lying already.

587
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,170
I'm tired of getting disappointed in you.

588
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,570
I'll be right there.

589
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,310
I'm telling you I didn't do it!

590
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,310
Then why is money missing?

591
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm Si-a's mom.

592
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,830
What's going on?

593
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,630
She stole money from the store.

594
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,970
It wasn't me.

595
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,670
Hong Si-a. Be quiet.

596
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,640
Can I take a look at your CCTV footage?

597
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,210
The CCTV camera is broken.

598
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,450
In any case,
she was the only part-time employee today,

599
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,880
so who would've stolen the money?
It's obvious.

600
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,990
Sir, I'm sure you were surprised,

601
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,790
but I don't think that Si-a would
steal money from you.

602
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,030
Don't just assume that my child stole it,

603
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,700
look for it one more time,
and give me a call.

604
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,110
If you still can't find it,

605
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,480
then I'll take responsibility for it
and compensate you.

606
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,850
Okay, then.

607
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,980
I'm really sorry.

608
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,660
Hong Si-a.

609
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,730
Why did you do it?

610
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,430
I'm sorry.

611
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,540
But I really didn't steal it.

612
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,770
I know that you didn't steal it.

613
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,080
But why did you hide the fact
that you had a part-time job?

614
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,080
To be honest,
I want to attend a makeup academy,

615
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,350
so I was saving up to pay for it.

616
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,290
A makeup academy?

617
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,360
You were interested in doing makeup?

618
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,930
Yes.

619
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,900
Did you think

620
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
that I couldn't pay for your classes,

621
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,840
so you got a job without telling me?

622
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
No.

623
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
I just

624
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,940
wanted to do it on my own.

625
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,180
On your own?

626
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,280
How can an 18-year-old
do anything on her own?

627
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,050
I'll pay for your classes,

628
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,820
so quit your part-time job immediately.

629
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,650
How will you

630
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,720
prepare for college
while working a part-time job?

631
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,120
I'm not going to college.

632
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,830
Hong Si-a.

633
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,660
When you enter the real world,
no matter how skilled you are,

634
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,370
people will judge you based
on the college you attended.

635
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,740
They won't even give you a chance,

636
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,200
so why won't you go to college?

637
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,770
Why are you getting mad without listening to me?

638
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,810
I have been looking into it for a year,

639
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,980
and I thought about it carefully
before making my decision.

640
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,910
You don't know anything about this field.

641
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,520
I'll take care of it on my own,

642
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,550
so don't interfere
if you don't know about it.

643
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,460
Don't interfere?

644
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,090
I do my best to make sure

645
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,390
you can learn, eat, and do whatever you want.

646
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,230
But how can you say that to me?

647
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,300
Are you saying that the reason
you live like this is because of me again?

648
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,200
I know that

649
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,970
I was born because of a mistake you and Dad made.

650
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,110
That's why I'm trying not to burden you.

651
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,950
What?

652
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,650
It's true that I'm a burden
in your life and Dad's.

653
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,160
You had no interest in me ever,

654
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,890
so stop pretending to care now.

655
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,300
Si-a.

656
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,230
Goodness, Si-a!

657
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,230
How can she be so mean to her mother?

658
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,870
You must've been surprised.

659
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,970
I think Si-a is
misunderstanding something.

660
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,800
I'll have a talk with her.

661
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,340
Don't worry and just head home.

662
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,950
It's fine.

663
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,720
She doesn't know what you went through to raise her.

664
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,990
What an ungrateful girl.

("Actress Kim Bit-na, the New MC of 'Couples in Crises'!")

666
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,130
You must be upset.

667
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,070
What?

668
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I wasn't even trying to listen to you.

669
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,340
I'm sorry for getting mad.

670
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,780
But Si-a, I don't see you

671
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,350
as a child I had accidentally.

672
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,620
To me,

673
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,630
you're the biggest blessing in my life.

674
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,430
You have to know that.

675
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,130
I'm sorry, Mom.

676
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,500
It's fine.

677
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,970
I'm sorry.

678
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,510
I'll always listen to you first now.

679
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,710
So, whatever it is,

680
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,850
feel free to tell me.

681
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,190
I'm always curious

682
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,190
about what you're thinking about

683
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,590
and what aspirations you have.

684
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,630
I certainly care.

685
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,370
And as for going to college,

686
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,040
I was wrong.

687
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,570
When I was younger,
my lack of education stopped me

688
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,210
from doing what I wanted.

689
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,280
So hearing you

690
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,910
say that you don't want to go to college

691
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,520
scared me.

692
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,490
But I've looked into it,

693
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,260
and apparently, work experience
matters more

694
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,220
for makeup artists.

695
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,160
Yes.

696
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,900
I'm going to get my makeup certificate
instead of studying for college

697
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,570
and polish my skills by gaining more work experience.

698
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,370
From next year, I'm going to prepare
and enter contests.

699
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,710
If I get awards from the contests,
I'll get employed faster.

700
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,540
Right.

701
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,650
Okay. Do that.

702
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,350
Really?

703
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,950
But one thing.

704
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,890
You should quit your part-time job.

705
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,960
I can support you.

706
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,060
Okay.

707
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,170
What?

708
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,840
You two made up already?

709
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,040
Where did you go?

710
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,540
Well,

711
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,340
I got a little something
to make you feel better.

712
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,580
Cheers!

713
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,180
Why don't we three girls have a drink?

714
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,520
Including me?

715
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,150
You have Grandma and Mom watching.
It's fine.

716
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,590
Just grab a beer.

717
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,860
Mom, can I do that?

718
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,100
Let's have a party among us girls.

719
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,700
What a surprise. You never let me!

I'm sorry.

What are you talking about?

723
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,980
You know.

724
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,250
I could never support your dreams,

725
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,390
and this is all that I can do
on a day like this too.

726
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,430
I could never pay back for your love.

727
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:44,960
Don't say that.

728
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,630
Here, you two.

729
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,170
Please be born as my daughters
in the next life.

730
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,610
I'll let you two do anything you want
in your next lives.

What are you talking about?

732
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,740
I'm going to do everything I want
in this life

733
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,850
and help you do everything you want
as well.

734
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,250
Yes, Si-a.

735
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,890
Don't you say that. I'm going to do
everything I want in this life.

736
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,990
Let's all do everything

You had no interest in me ever,

so stop pretending to care now.

00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,850
I'm sorry.

831
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,150
I'm sorry, Si-a.

832
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,490
Dad. You'll come and see me, right?

833
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,390
Si-a.

834
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,160
I will make sure

835
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:09,600
to be there.

836
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:00,280
(Hong Dae-young)

837
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,690
Why did you call me again?

838
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,930
I have something to tell you.

839
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,230
I have nothing to tell you.

840
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,200
I'm near our house.

841
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
I want to tell you this in person.

842
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,670
Okay.

843
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,530
Where are you?

844
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Da-jung.

845
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,600
I'm Dae-young.

846
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,710
I'm not Go Woo-young.

847
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:07,580
I'm Hong Dae-young.

848
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,550
- Over here.
- She's gorgeous.

849
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,580
(3 years ago)
- In 1, 2. - Look here!

850
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,480
- Look over here too.
- Great.

851
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,580
Hey, can you look over here too?

852
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,050
- You look so pretty.
- You look beautiful.

853
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,690
Bride, please look over here. 1, 2.

854
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,360
- All right. Great. How beautiful.
- So pretty.

855
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,900
Hey, girl!

856
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,860
My gosh. Hey, you!

857
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,630
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

858
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,370
- Your dress looks so beautiful.
- Look at her.

859
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,040
All right. Let's take another one.

860
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,940
- Okay. 1, 2.
- No.

861
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,380
Your dress looks gorgeous.

862
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,700
The bride looked really pretty.

863
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,870
I know it's late,
but should we have a wedding?

864
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,700
No.

865
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,170
It'll cost a fortune to plan a wedding.

866
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,240
Let's go on a trip with Si-a and Si-woo
with that money instead.

867
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,150
I really want to make

868
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:55,620
a lot of good memories for our children.

869
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,020
That's all I want.

870
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,120
- Here.
- What?

871
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,830
I'm fine.

872
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,660
I'm not fine with that.

873
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,730
Cover yourself with that.

874
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'll go buy an umbrella.

875
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,850
What were you looking at?

876
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:27,620
Nothing.

877
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,550
I didn't know I would change like this
when I was young.

878
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,050
"Change"?

879
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,160
You haven't changed one bit.

880
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,530
You must be cold.

881
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,030
I'm fine.

882
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,530
Well,

883
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,130
can you accept this?

884
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,870
What a surprise.

885
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,110
Thank you.

886
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,650
Why are you staring at me?

887
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,120
Because you're pretty.

888
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,300
I'm sorry.

889
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,940
And thank you.

890
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,870
To me, you are still

891
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,380
the most beautiful woman in this world.

892
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,860
Let's go now.

893
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,130
(To be honest,)

894
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,970
(my heart fluttered)

895
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:57,370
for Woo-young.

896
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:00,540
But the thing is

897
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,950
I'm not sure if my heart fluttered

898
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,720
because it was Woo-young

899
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,680
or because he resembled Dae-young.

900
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,350
Woo-young

901
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,860
has his looks and his voice.

902
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,460
He even behaves like Dae-young.

903
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,060
When I see Woo-young,

904
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,840
I keep thinking about Hong Dae-young

905
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,310
whom my heart fluttered for before.

906
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,140
But why is he acting

907
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,810
just like Dae-young with the same looks?

908
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,080
Da-jung.

909
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,620
- The truth is...
- Right.

910
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,350
It's my fault.

911
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,260
I should draw a line starting right now.

912
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,190
I should tell him that I'm a parent
and he's a student.

913
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,430
I'll get going now.

914
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,300
Da-jung!

915
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,510
Gosh. I don't know anymore.

916
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,880
But

917
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,210
she told me her heart
didn't flutter for her husband.
