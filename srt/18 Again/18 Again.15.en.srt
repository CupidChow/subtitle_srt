1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,130
You said you regretted it.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,870
You regretted meeting me
and ruining your life.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
I let you go, so you can live a good life.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,740
I didn't ask you to stay.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,170
But...

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,710
But

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,850
why are you here again?

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,520
Whenever you stayed by my side,

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,030
do you know what went through my head?

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,500
"I miss you."

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,070
"I miss you, Hong Dae-young."

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,120
I missed you too.

13
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,820
You look just like when you were young.

14
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,590
How did I miss it?

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,830
Come to think of it,

16
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,770
so many things didn't make sense.

17
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,740
I must be a fool.

18
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,210
No.

19
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,740
I was wrong.

20
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,180
I should've told you the truth.

21
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,550
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,070
=Episode 15, Confession=

23
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,680
What?

24
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,080
You thought I was having an affair?

25
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,720
It's because

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,250
I didn't know why you wanted a divorce.

27
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,690
Is that why you were so mean to me in the beginning?

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,590
Yes.

29
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,230
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
It's okay.

31
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,500
It was just a misunderstanding.

32
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,300
Now I know

33
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,910
that even if you're a married couple,

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,970
you can't know what the other is thinking

35
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,040
if they don't say anything.

36
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,310
Thank you for understanding.

37
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,980
Oh, right.

38
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,620
There's one more thing.

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,790
I'm telling you so that
there won't be any misunderstandings.

40
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,190
There's nothing going on
between me and Mr. Ye Ji-hoon.

41
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,390
At that time, I--

42
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,330
You must've had a really hard time.

43
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,400
You had to lie because of me.

44
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,900
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,700
It's okay.

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,740
Thank you

47
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,580
for taking care of us without our knowing.

48
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,320
Oh, the bus is here.

49
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,390
- I'll get going now.
- Right.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,060
Get home safe.

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,820
What?

52
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,050
Why did you get on?

53
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,520
Let's not

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
go home today.

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,790
What?

56
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,080
- 1, 2.
- I said it was dangerous.

57
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,420
My goodness.

58
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,550
Oh, Mom.

59
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,890
Are you just getting in?

60
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,360
What? Yes.

61
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,660
I had plans, and I came home a bit late.

62
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,600
You weren't a bit late.

63
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,560
Right.

64
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,470
It's okay.

65
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,140
You need to release your stress too.

66
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
What?

67
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,940
Wait a bit. I'll make you breakfast.

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,010
No, it's okay. You must be tired.
Get some rest.

69
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,600
It's fine. Just wait a bit.

70
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,200
Back in the days, I would be fine
after playing all night long.

71
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,430
But it's not easy now that I'm older.

72
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,170
Hey. What is it?

73
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,880
Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.

74
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,980
What?

75
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,750
We just said goodbye.

76
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,490
Who is she on the phone with at this hour?

77
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,530
Hong Si-a.

78
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,870
- Are you going to class?
- Yes.

79
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go together.

80
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,240
What if someone sees us?

81
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,510
I told you to keep it a secret in school.

82
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,240
I don't care if we get caught.

83
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,450
Do you care?

84
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,520
No. It's not like that.

85
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
What is it?

86
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,860
What's wrong?

87
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,130
Si-a. You came to school early today.

88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,300
What is it?
Why are you picking a fight with me?

89
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm complimenting you.

90
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,240
You're not late for school these days,
and you're very diligent.

91
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,480
(- Hooray!
- Go!)

92
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,650
(- Go!
- Let's go!)

93
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,050
(- Go!
- Go!)

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,820
(You did well, okay?
Who gave you such fast and strong legs?)

95
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,560
What are you talking about?

96
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,100
My goodness.

97
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,940
What am I thinking right now?

98
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,750
Please take a look
at these lucky bracelets.

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,190
Take a look at them.

100
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
This is pretty.

101
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,500
Can I pay with a card?

102
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,030
We only accept cash here.

103
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,040
Is that so?

104
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
- I'll come back another time.
- Okay.

105
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,210
Oh, aren't you the baseball player,
Ye Ji-hoon?

106
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm a fan. Can you give me your autograph?

107
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,920
Sure.

108
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,060
In return, can you do me a favor?

109
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,490
Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

110
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,900
What? Hello.

111
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,470
I'm a fan. Here.

112
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,370
What is this?

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,180
It's a present. Goodbye.

114
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,410
Hey.

115
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,850
I was going to give it to Si-a.

116
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,090
I guess I should wear it.

117
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,610
Do you remember the car accident

118
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,010
that occurred on Christmas Day?

119
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,050
Why did you do that?

120
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,830
(Hiring New and Experienced
Anchors and Sports Reporters)

122
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,740
Hello, Dae-young.

123
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,610
What were you doing?

124
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,880
I was looking at places to interview with.

125
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,250
(- Interview?)
- Yes.

126
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm going to apply to everywhere I can.

127
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,150
(Goodness.)

128
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm sure a lot of broadcasting stations
will be fighting to hire you.

129
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,750
My gosh.

130
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,790
What about you? What were you doing?

131
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,090
I just finished practice,
and I'm on my way home.

132
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,160
You had practice today?
Were you okay after staying up all night?

133
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,930
Of course. I'm fine.

134
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,500
Being young is nice.

135
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,670
I woke up when the sun set.

136
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,810
(It's good to get plenty of rest.)

137
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,710
Da-jung.

138
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,010
Are you free tomorrow?

139
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,380
Tomorrow?

140
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,220
Yes, I'm free. Why?

141
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,790
Let's go on a date.

142
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,160
Gosh. A date?

143
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,190
Yes.

144
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,260
Is there anything you want to do?

145
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,370
Yes, there is.

146
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,610
What is it?
Why did the two of you call us here?

147
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,680
Right. You said
you had something urgent to tell us.

148
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,590
Deok-jin.

149
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,790
You're my friend,

150
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,320
and Woo-young is your son.

151
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,260
That's why I tried to hold it in.

152
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,730
But

153
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,070
I can't hold it in any longer.

154
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,730
Hold what in?

155
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,010
I'm sure now.

156
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Actually,

157
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,410
I sincerely

158
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,880
love Woo-young.

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,550
- What?
- What?

160
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,020
Woo-young is turning legal soon.

161
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,520
In Hollywood, an 18-year-old age gap
is considered nothing.

162
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,690
So, Deok-jin,

163
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,660
give us your blessing.

164
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Well,

165
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,740
I can't really say anything.

166
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,740
I can't hold it in anymore.

167
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,640
Da-jung, he's actually Hong Dae-young.

168
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,480
You really can't do this!

169
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,310
What are you saying?

170
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,220
Deok-jin, I'll take it that you're
approving of this.

171
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,920
Woo-young and I are official from now on,

172
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,920
so Ae-rin, keep that in mind.

173
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,860
We'll get going first.

174
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,260
Hey!

175
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,160
How come all of Mr. Go's friends

176
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,170
are so weird?

177
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,100
Maybe I should quit.

178
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,240
Da-jung! No.

179
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,370
What...

180
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,620
(I'm not entirely happy that you all lied to me,)

181
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
(but still, thanks for helping Dae-young all along.)

182
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,650
What is she saying?

183
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,290
What?

184
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,360
Did they fool us just now?

185
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,800
My gosh.

186
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,470
We have some really great friends.

187
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,770
Yes, we do.

188
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,680
That's...

189
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,520
Yes, it's the necklace that you gave me.

190
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
It's beautiful.

191
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,790
Where are we going now?

192
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,290
Hold on.

193
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,260
Here.

194
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,930
What's with the car?

195
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,670
I borrowed it from Deok-jin.

196
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,800
I wanted to go somewhere nice.
It's our first date in a long while.

197
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,740
No! You're still a minor.

198
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,940
Come on.

199
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,410
You know that I'm a great driver.

200
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
Still, no.

201
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,980
If we get into an accident,
you'll get caught without a license.

202
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,590
Is that right?

203
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,290
What should we do then?

204
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,220
I've already planned the date out.

205
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,360
Then leave the driving to me today.

206
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,960
I've driven without getting
into an accident for ten years.

207
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,940
Don't you think you're going
a little too fast?

208
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,010
What's wrong?
I'm still under the speed limit.

209
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,350
Do you

210
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,280
not trust me?

211
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,950
Of course I do.

212
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,990
I've just never seen you drive.

213
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,620
I drove quite a bit when I was
stationed in other cities for the news.

214
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,960
Is that right?

215
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,730
Why?

216
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Nothing. It's just really cool
to see you drive.

217
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,370
It feels new.

218
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,200
Says you.

219
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,240
This is fun. I haven't driven in a while.

220
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,680
I can't believe that I'm driving
a sports car.

221
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,450
Da-jung, I think you should slow down.

222
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,980
Da-jung!

223
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,990
Da-jung!

224
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,530
This place is beautiful.

225
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,960
How did you find out about this place?

226
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,260
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

227
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,170
It's beautiful,

228
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,070
and the air is fresh.

229
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,770
I love it.

230
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,340
That's good. I searched online
all night to find the place.

231
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,040
- Really?
- Yes.

232
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,490
- What?
- Get excited.

233
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,790
We have a full-on date today.

234
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,030
Stand over there.

235
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,670
One, two, three.

236
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,610
You look beautiful.

237
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,540
Look at that!

238
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,270
It's so pretty.

239
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,540
Would I look good here?

240
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,260
Here I go.

241
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,050
One, two, three.

242
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,760
Da-jung, stand over there.

243
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,600
Give it to me. I'll take one of you now.

244
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm fine.

245
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,140
Come on. We've come so far.

246
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,270
We need a photo of you.

247
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,340
Let's take one together then.

248
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Together?

249
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,950
Here we go.

250
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,150
One, two, three.

251
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,670
It's been a while since we did this.
It's so much fun.

252
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,970
We took photos on our first date too.

253
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
We had a great time
at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, remember?

254
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,710
You remember that?

255
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,010
Absolutely.

256
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,920
It was my first date with my first love.

257
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,120
How can I forget that?

258
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,890
I heard that I'm not
your first love though.

259
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,530
What? Who said that?

260
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,760
I heard Si-a say that at school.

261
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,570
I see.

262
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,440
How did I think that I was
your first love all along?

263
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,840
Who on earth is it?

264
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,850
Come on. It's all in the past now.

265
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
First love doesn't mean anything.

266
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,420
It means everything to me!

267
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
Look at you.

268
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,160
Why can't you say anything?

269
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,190
Is it

270
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,260
someone I know?

271
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,030
What are you doing?

272
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,930
Are you being jealous right now?

273
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,370
Of course I am!

274
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,630
What?

275
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,300
All right.

276
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,470
My first love is...

277
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,650
Look! The sun is setting.

278
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,160
That's too bad,
I want some more time here.

279
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,890
Why aren't you saying anything?

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,960
Tell me!

281
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,560
Who is it?

282
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,260
(If you're watching with your engine off,
turn it on every half an hour.)

283
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Here.

284
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,890
Why are you smiling?

285
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,260
Nothing.

286
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,290
Coming to a movie theater

287
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,060
just reminded me of the time
you got mad at me.

288
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
At you?

289
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,330
Why?

290
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,670
You got really mad at me

291
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,240
because I watched a movie
with Choi Il-kwon.

292
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,410
To make you stop being mad, I...

293
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
You what?

294
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,650
What?

295
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,450
What did you say?

296
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,090
Well...

297
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,620
I...

298
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,760
"I love you."

299
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,360
- What?
- That's what you said.

300
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,130
Right.

301
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,210
What?

302
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,310
Nothing.

303
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,290
(You're acting like it's your first relationship.)

304
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,890
(I've had enough.)

305
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,030
(The more time goes by,
the more confused I get.)

306
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,230
(Now, I can tell what someone is like)

307
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,330
(just after exchanging a few words.)

308
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,970
(I understand why people say)

309
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,470
(that you should date and get married
while you're still naive.)

310
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,340
(You've never sincerely loved someone,
have you?)

311
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,340
(I just don't fantasize about love.)

312
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,410
(The old sayings are right.)

313
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,150
(The more men you date, the better.)

314
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,480
(All men are the same.)

315
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,080
This is Si-a's favorite. Try some.

316
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Is that right?

317
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,890
It's good.

318
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,490
Is it?

319
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,690
Yes.

320
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,630
How long has it been since we last had
a date like this?

321
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,640
I don't know.

322
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,410
It's been so long, I don't even remember.

323
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,640
I guess we've been so busy with our lives.

324
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,710
I guess so.

325
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,450
But it's not all bad.

326
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,690
Since we haven't done a lot of things,
it's easier to get excited for them.

327
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,530
Then, let's do all the things
we didn't get to do when we were young.

328
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Sure.

329
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,540
Isn't that Jung Da-jung?

330
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,410
Yes, I think it is her.

331
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,110
- Who is that guy next to her?
- Right?

332
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,020
Aren't you

333
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,690
Ms. Jung Da-jung, the anchorwoman?

334
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,660
Yes.

335
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,300
I'm a fan.

336
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,630
I heard you had a son in high school.

337
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,770
My gosh. You and your son
must be very close.

338
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,940
- I see. It's her son.
- No wonder.

339
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,450
Yes.

340
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,350
Thank you.

341
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,280
Okay. Enjoy your sandwich.

342
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,710
You must be tired.

343
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,210
Not at all.

344
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,210
I had a lot of fun today.

345
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,860
What if someone sees us?

346
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,200
- I'm sorry.
- I'll go inside.

347
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,330
Okay.

348
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,670
I really hate him.

349
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,010
(He likes you. And)

350
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,950
you like him too.

351
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,790
What are you two doing?

352
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,490
Yes.

353
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,930
I'm dating Ji-ho.

354
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,990
What?

355
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,270
Can you keep this a secret
to other people?

356
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,440
Okay?

357
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,210
So you two are really dating?

358
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,510
Yes.

359
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,980
You're the only one who knows.

360
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,750
We're friends.

361
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,590
Okay. I'm your friend. Right.

362
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,620
You'll keep our secret, right?

363
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,260
Then, we'll get going.

364
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,380
Hello?

365
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,280
(I'm calling from Serim High School.)

366
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,550
(Is this Mr. Hong Dae-young, Hong Si-a's father?)

367
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,350
Yes, this is him.

368
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,090
What is this about?

369
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,360
Hello?

370
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,730
Go ahead.

371
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,730
What was that?

372
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,810
This is Woo-young's phone number.

373
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,640
Gosh.

374
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,810
I know

375
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,280
you explained this to me,
but this is hard to believe.

376
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,520
Even you found out, Ji-ho.

377
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,230
I'm sorry about this.

378
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,930
Don't say that.

379
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,630
I'm sorry.

380
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
I had no idea who you were
and was rude to you.

381
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,500
No. You were never rude to me.

382
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,140
I'm sorry.

383
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,080
No. Gosh. Sit down.

384
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,620
But Ji-ho,

385
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,020
how did you figure it out?

386
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,120
Well,

387
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,190
I have a video of the sports day
at my elementary school.

388
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
I remembered the video and watched it.

389
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,630
And your face...

390
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,900
I see.

391
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,040
I still wasn't sure then,

392
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,440
but I saw you two hugging each other.

393
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,980
I was able to stop Si-a from seeing that.

394
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,310
But she almost caught you.

395
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,020
But Ji-ho,

396
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,460
that means you were on a date
with my daughter until now.

397
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,190
Well,

398
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,800
today was our first date.

399
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,300
Is that so?

400
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,400
Tell me if you need more allowance.

401
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,310
I'll give you some money
for keeping my secret.

402
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
Thank you.

403
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,080
Gosh.

404
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,520
Mr. Hong.

405
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,990
Yes? What is it?

406
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,630
Coming back to your old self

407
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,800
will be hard, right?

408
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,180
- Wasn't that really delicious?
- You were eating a lot.

409
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,250
Si-a.

410
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,450
Let's walk around your house
one more time.

411
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,650
- Why?
- I don't want to say goodbye yet.

412
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,720
Okay.

413
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,320
It was so good.

414
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,330
Dad, aren't you tired?
I'll give you a massage at home.

415
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,960
Thanks, my princess.

416
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,930
When I get home...

417
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,970
- What is it?
- Okay?

418
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,400
They seem happy together.

419
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,110
I was always mean to my dad.

420
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,910
When he called, I didn't answer it
because it was a hassle.

421
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Whenever we were together, I was grumpy.

422
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,720
When he bought me a meal the other day,

423
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,550
I invited my friends
because I didn't want him to nag me.

424
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,290
Had I known it would be this hard
to see my dad again,

425
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,930
I would have been nicer to him.

426

Why is she calling me?

What? The police station?

431
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,420
Are you sure this is it?
Don't you have more?

432
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,760
No. That's it.

433
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,490

Malicious comments?

443
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,880
I didn't write them for that purpose.

444
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,080
They feel guilty which is why they're overreacting.

445
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,990
Please help me.

446
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,020
Can I see the complaint and evidence?

447
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,090

- She wrote this much?
- They were really upset.

451
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,940
They looked up her nickname and IP address

452
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,570
and collected everything she wrote.

(and she got pregnant in high school.)

- What?

457
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,100
This?

458
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,900
You were always really mean to Da-jung ever
since we were young.

459
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,770
What's your problem with her?

460
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,510
Gosh. I've always hated Jung Da-jung.

461
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,540
Also, before Jung Da-jung appeared,

462
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,350
you and I were best friends.

463
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,620
If it wasn't for her,
you and I wouldn't have gotten so distant.

464
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,620
When I saw she was having a hard time in life,

465
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,020
I thought she was getting punished,
so I tried to forgive her.

466
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,560
But she became an anchorwoman and appeared on TV

467
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,030
and acted like she was so nice and smart.

468
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,120
I couldn't hold it in when I saw her acting so fake.

469
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,730
I wanted everyone to find out what a greedy

470
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,120
and selfish person she is.

471
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,210
I think the term selfish suits you more.

472
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,770
- What?
- You know,

473
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,740
I have a belief when I defend someone.

474
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,210
I try to embrace trashy people with my heart.

475
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,080
But I can't embrace someone
who talks ill about my friend.

You can look for another lawyer,

477

or you can settle with them.

478
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,160
Hey! Why do you only care for her?

479

I'm your friend too, darn it!

480

Do you remember when the girls
from the other school came looking for me?

481
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,370
- I told you to behave.
- It's not that...

482
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,200
You've gotten quite bold, haven't you?

483
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,600
- Let go of it.
- Sang-Hee.

We're not done talking.

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,540
- and I'll see you tomorrow at practice.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,970
- Good job, you guys.
- Good job.

503
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,780
Go Woo-young and Hong Si-woo.
See me for a second.

504
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,410
Yes, sir.

505
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,950
(Be in your best condition for the best outcome.)

506
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,980
The scout for Hankuk University said
he was very impressed

507
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,980
by the two of you.

508
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,720
If we win the finals,
Hankuk University said they want to scout you two.

509
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
So do your best.

510
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,030
Yes, sir.

511
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,030
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.

512
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,830
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

513
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,640
Hey. Nice.

514
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
Good job.

515
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,570
Isn't Hankuk University
the school you wanted to go to?

516
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,970
This is great, Si-woo.

517
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,340
Let's go to Hankuk University together.

518
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,510
Right.

519
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,820
Woo-young. You should go first.

520
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,220
I'm going to make a phone call.

521
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,490
Oh, okay.

522
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Okay.

523
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,140
(My Son)

524
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,490
Hey, Si-woo.

525
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,560
Hi, Dad. The finals are next Saturday.
Can you come?

526
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
I want to go, but...

527
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,530
(Oh, right.)

528
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,400
You're busy these days, right?

529
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,600
It's okay if you can't come.

530
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,710
I'll hang up now.

531
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,460
What? You didn't leave yet?

532
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,020
No. I wanted to go with you.

533
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
I see.

534
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,700
You look really upset.

535
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,040
To be honest,

536
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,140
I became interested in basketball
because of my dad.

537
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,350
Is that so?

538
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,120
Yes.

539
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,620
My dad

540
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,490
was Serim High School basketball team's ace,

541
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,490
but after I was born, he quit playing.

542
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,600
That's why
I wanted to achieve my dad's dream for him.

543
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,130
But I was afraid he'd be disappointed if I was bad,

544
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,770
so I pretended not to care about basketball.

545
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,840
I didn't know you had those thoughts.

546
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,710
I wanted to tell him
when I was good enough.

547
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,920
That's why
when I got into the basketball team,

548
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,020
my dad was the first person I called.

549
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,260
I wanted him to see me play in the finals,

550
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,490
so I practiced really hard.

551
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,000
But he said he can't come.

552
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,110
My dad can't come either
because he's busy.

553
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,520
Why do you guys look so sad when we won?

554
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,150
You should join us at the PC cafe
to release some stress.

555
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,090
- Me too?
- Yes, you too.

556
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,660
- Don't you want to go?
- No. I do.

557
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,960
Are you going to go too, Woo-young?

558
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,570
Oh, I have something to take care of,

559
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,500
so you should go have fun.

560
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,340
You always act like you're so busy.
Hey, let's go.

561
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,020
You did a good job today.

562
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,590
I called you last minute, but you came.
Thank you so much.

563
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,090
It was nothing.

564
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,700
You can call me whenever you need me.

565
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,270
I'm really free these days.

566
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,740
Okay. I'll call you if I need your help.

567
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,970
- Okay. Be sure to call me.
- Okay.

568
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,870
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

569
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,020
(Nam Tae-hee got his fourth homerun of the season.)

570
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,190
(Didn't Ye Ji-hoon let a homerun happen too easily?)

571
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,330
(Including this homerun,
his ball control has been unstable throughout this game.)

572
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,860
(He's been allowing the batters
to hit his balls too easily.)

573
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,100
(That's unfortunate.)

574
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,600
(Is Ye Ji-hoon hurt? Or is he in a slump?)
(I'm worried something has happened to Ye Ji-hoon.)

575
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,340
(Can't we suspect that he's in a slump right now?)

576
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,740
(Ye Ji-hoon isn't the type of player to be in a slump.)

577
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,080
(I'm wondering if he's been hurt.)

578
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,680
(- Hurt? His team hasn't said anything)
- Are you okay?

579
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,880
(- about him being hurt.)
- Oh, my.

580
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,680
- Yes.
- Then

581
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,290
do you want to get coffee with me?

582
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,290
It's nice to see you
in the baseball stadium.

583
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,800
Did you come for an interview?

584
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,900
No. I'm here to get some work.

585
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,340
I got fired.

586
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,370
You got fired?

587
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,810
Yes.

588
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,810
I guess I wasn't good enough
to become a permanent employee.

589
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,510
What are you talking about?

590
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,750
So many programs became successful
because of you.

591
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,950
My goodness.

592
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,290
They need to fail without you
to come to their senses.

593
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,560
Broadcasting people are really dumb!

594
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,830
Ji-hoon.

595
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,890
What if someone hears you?

596
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,460
Let them hear me.

597
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,830
I'm going to curse them, so they can fail.
Just wait and see.

598
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,840
Are you okay?

599
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,780
I heard you might be hurt.

600
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,050
Gosh.

601
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm not hurt.

602
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,950
Then what is it?

603
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,960
I wanted to be a good dad to Seo-yeon.

604
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,960
But I feel like

605
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,030
she's only getting hurt because of me.

606
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,000
- What is it?
- Do you want to go swimming?

607
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,730
- Yes.
- Do you like the idea?

608
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,600
Yes.

609
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,640
Seo-yeon,

610
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,770
do you miss your mom?

611
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,980
We're not open yet.

612
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,620
Could you meet with Seo-yeon just once?

613
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,360
No. She doesn't know about me anyway.

614
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,600
She does.

615
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,070
She even went

616
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,670
to the hospital you worked at to see you.

617
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,870
- What?
- She misses you a lot.

618
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,440
Can you please meet her once?

619
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,680
Are you happy that you're getting
to see Mom?

620
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,450
Yes, I am!

621
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,690
Mom?

622
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,160
That's right. I'm your mom.

623
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,530
But I've forgotten you long ago.

624
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,140
I never thought of myself as someone
with a daughter.

625
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,370
What?

626
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,370
What are you doing?

627
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,680
Can't you tell?

628
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,220
Don't cry, Seo-yeon.

629
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,050
Your mom is just like this.

630
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,790
So, don't you ever miss me
or come looking for me again.

631
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,090
I'm not going to see you even if you do.

632
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Understood?

633
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,290
Mom...

634
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,830
Why did you do that to her?

635
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,570
So that she won't get attached.

636
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,340
Why can't she get attached?

637
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,600
She's your daughter.

638
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,640
My daughter?

639
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,470
I had her by mistake when I was young.

640
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,540
I didn't know anything back then.

641
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,010
I'm not responsible for her.

642
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,330
I'm sorry, Seo-yeon.

643
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,440
I'm sorry.

644
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm so sorry.

645
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,130
The more I try,

646
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,400
the worse it's getting, it seems.

647
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,370
You're not making anything worse.

648
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,070
But what do you think

649
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,340
about staying as an uncle

650
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,680
to Seo-yeon?

651
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,980
An uncle?

652
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,980
Just like how nobody else can be
your brother,

653
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,220
to Seo-yeon,

654
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,990
there will always be just one father.

655
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,120
I think it'd be good

656
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,830
to let her think that.

657
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,200
Seo-yeon!

658
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,030
Come to Dad.

659
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,610
You're right.

660
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,580
All along, I was trying

661
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,180
to make Seo-yeon forget
someone who means the world to her.

662
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,750
You heard from Si-a, right?

663
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,790
I was looking for your husband.

664
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,620
Oh... Yes.

665
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,990
I know you haven't forgotten about him,

666
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
so I didn't want to bring him up
and give you a hard time.

667
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,000
That's why I haven't said anything,

668
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,940
but I guess I should now.

669
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,740
Remember how I said that my brother died
in an accident?

670
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,980
Yes.

671
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,150
That day,

672
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,750
Seo-yeon was also in the car.

673
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,720
Seo-yeon,

674
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,930
it seems like we'll have to spend
Christmas without Uncle Ji-hoon this year.

675
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:46,700
Really? I miss Uncle Ji-hoon.

676
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,570
Seo-yeon, do you want to call
Uncle Ji-hoon right now?

677
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,300
- Yes!
- All right. Hold on a second.

678
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,410
A drowsy driver

679
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,810
ran into my brother's car.

680
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,520
Your phone is off.

681
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,190
Ji-hoon, make sure to eat well in the US,

682
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,320
and don't practice beyond your limit.

683
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,220
Merry Christmas!

684
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,630
And don't practice beyond your limit.

685
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,670
What was that?

686
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,780
Are you okay?

687
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,480
(There's a child in the car.)

688
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:50,960
Seo-yeon...

689
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,640
Excuse me!

690
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,810
Excuse me! Please help me here!

691
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:17,420
Seo-yeon and my brother were
both in danger.

692
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:21,990
Then...

693
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,270
Thank you.

694
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,640
Just hold on.

695
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,940
Please help!

696
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,480
Seo-yeon...

697
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,810
- Are you okay, sir?
- Sir.

698
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,940
Hello?

699
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,190
So,

700
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,720
why did you get into an accident?

701
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,420
Sorry?

702
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,060
Well...

703
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,660
So,

704
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,470
the man in the accident was your brother?

705
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,000
Yes, it was.

706
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,070
That's why I really wanted
to meet Mr. Hong.

707
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,220
Sir,

708
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,590
is the child okay?

709
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,560
Yes, she is.

710
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,700
That's good to hear.

711
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,570
Are you the man who saved the girl
from the car?

712
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,700
Well, yes.

713
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,000
I see.

714
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,070
Her family is coming on a flight
right now.

715
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,380
He'd like to meet you
and compensate you for it.

716
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,840
Could I have your number, please?

717
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:57,910
No.

718
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,710
I didn't do it to get paid.

719
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,320
I did it because she reminded me
of my daughter.

720
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,290
I see.

721
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,590
Goodbye.

722
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,640
(Our condolences.)

723
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,400
(From Woorim High School)

724
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,470
Seo-yeon.

725
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,990
He didn't want to disclose
his identity to the police.

726
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,090
He also turned down any reward
for saving my niece.

727
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,290
But I still thought thanking him

728
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,300
and giving him a reward was
the right thing to do.

729
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,730
So I contacted him.

730
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,270
I'm sorry.

731
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,870
I should have saved
your older brother too.

732
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,170
It's not your fault.

733
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,280
You risked your life and saved Seo-yeon.

734
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,780
So

735
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,920
I would really like to show you
my appreciation.

736
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,020
No. I didn't do it for the money.

737
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,620
I just did it

738
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,290
because I was reminded of my own daughter.

739
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,530
(He told me he did it
because he thought about his daughter.)

740
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,170
When I called him recently,

741
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,570
he said the same thing.

742
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,470
Your husband

743
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,210
is a great man.

744
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,840
He is.

745
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,210
He's a good person.

746
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,350
To be honest,

747
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,750
if you told me
you couldn't get over someone else,

748
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,390
I wouldn't have given up.

749
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,660
But if it's him,

750
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,230
I can't be his match.

751
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,100
I wish

752
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,170
only happiness for you two.

753
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,520
It would be difficult for us
to be good friends,

754
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,050
right?

755
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,890
I thought we were friends.

756
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,490
I thought you were my good friend.

Why not?

777
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,030
He might leave.

778

that Hankuk University
is going to scout you.

do whatever it takes
to find a way to go back.

820

To me, you and our children

821

are more important than my dream.

So

823
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,630
will you give up your dream
just like before?

824
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,070
I'm not giving it up.

825
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,130
Then, what is it?

826
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,740

really end this now.

830
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,290
Don't say things you don't mean.

831
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,020
No.

832
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,690
I called you,

833
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,230
so I can say this to you.

834
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,570
Our kids are all grown up now.

835
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,670
I can look after them by myself.

836
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,280
So you should live your own life.

837
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,710
You're a good person.

838
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,250
And you deserve more than that.

839
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,220
Da-jung.

840
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,860
You can stay

841
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,560
in their lives

842
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,360
as their friend just like now.

843
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,160
And we should

844
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,870
live our own lives.

845
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,780
Da-jung.

846
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,620
I...

847
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,250
I want to stay by your side.

848
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,760
Look what happened to your life
when you did that.

849
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,530
To be honest,

850
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,270
it was

851
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,470
really hard seeing you

852
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,070
play basketball.

853
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:36,710
(You seemed so happy)

854
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,240
(when you were playing basketball.)

855
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,010
(It made me wonder)

856
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,250
(what would have happened)

857
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,450
(if I didn't tell you I was pregnant
18 years ago.)

858
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,130
I kept thinking about that in my head

859
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:58,000
and regretted it.

860
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,630
You did too,

861
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,700
didn't you?

862
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,350
Regretting your life with me once

863
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,750
is enough.

864
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,250
We know it firsthand.

865
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,990
I won't do that again.

866
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,900
Give me a chance.

867
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:36,500
No.

868
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,310
You already have a chance now.

869
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,280
Don't

870
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,910
miss that chance.

871
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,720
Woo-young.

872
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,330
(Passion, pride, and Serim)

873
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:48,740
Let's go back,

874
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,980
Hong Dae-young.

875
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,720
Gosh.

876
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,270
Please.

877
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,100
Please. Let's go back to my real life.

878
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,130
I want my life back!

879
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:54,010
Why can't I go back? Why not?

880
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,540
Please!

881
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,350
(Epilogue)

882
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,420
(We are Korea!)

883
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,190
Yes, Mom.

884
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:50,330
What's wrong with your voice?
Did something happen?

885
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,470
No. Nothing happened.

886
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,570
Da-jung.

887
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,570
Move back home with your kids
if it's too hard.

888
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,610
No. Dae-young takes good care of us.

889
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:09,710
I'm all right.

890
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:10,750
(Deoksan Hill)

891
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,090
- Let's go, Korea!
- Let's go, Korea!

892
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:23,060
(Everyone was wildly cheering for Korea
in summer of 2002.)

893
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,630
(You at the age of 20 cried
because you were heartbroken)

894
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:30,940
(by your own misery)

895
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,370
(and by heartless people.)

896
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,610
(They made you cry.)

897
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,440
(I wanted to comfort you)

898
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,110
(by telling you not to try so hard
when you were crying.)

899
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,980
Da-jung.

900
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,860
(But you tried
and put a smile on your face.)

901
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:58,030
Why did you wait for me out here?
You must be tired.

902
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:01,670
(And I didn't want to make you cry.)

903
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:12,180
Are you okay?

904
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,280
Oh, this? I'm fine.

905
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:17,310
It's a small cut.

906
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:21,220
(When the whole world
turned its back on you,)

907
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,690
(I believed in you.)

908
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,330
(We were covered in wounds.)

909
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,830
(But)

910
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,030
(we were each other's brightest star.)
