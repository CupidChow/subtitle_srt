What do you want to eat?

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,990
Something delicious.

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,830
I like that too.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,500
Right.

Hey, my hubby.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,890
I'm sorry to call you. You must be tired.

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,060
We were shooting on an island.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,100
I had such a hard time
because I got seasick on the boat.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
It sounds like my wifey had a tough day.

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,200
Yes, it was tough

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,770
because I missed you so much.

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,810
I see.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,810
What about you?

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,510
Me? What about me?

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,810
Anything to say to me?

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,980
Oh, right. I'm going on a business trip.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,980
For a week to Gwangju.

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,920
Can you pack me some underwear and socks?

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,690
And?

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,290
"And"?

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,720
Pack my toothbrush and razor too.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,760
- Hey, Dae-young!
- Gosh, you startled me.

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,290
You'll make me go deaf. What's wrong?

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,900
Is packing your bag my job?

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,100
You're not a kid.
You can pack your underwear yourself.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,930
Why are you getting mad over that?

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,270
Is that such a hard thing to do?

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,870
It's not that.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,970
I told you that I missed you.

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,040
But why won't you say it back?

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,279
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,280
You've changed.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,350
Back then,

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,220
you said you missed me
even when we were together.

38
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,219
We've been together for a decade.

39
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,260
If I miss you, that would be weird.

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,700
Fine. I'm the weird one.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,070
It must be so hard to live with
such a weird woman.

42
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,670
Gosh.

43

44
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,410
Da-jung, what's wrong?

45
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,040
Did I do something wrong?
I didn't do anything wrong.

46
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,280
My goodness.

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,780
That feels nice.

48
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,379
Jin-cheol, you can take a shower now.

49
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,850
Okay. Gosh.

But hang in there. I'll be home tomorrow.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
Should I buy a delicious treat
on my way home?

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yes.

Goodness.

57

Do I have to send you a kiss

58
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,510
when Dae-young is sitting next to me?

59

Okay.

Oh, the thing is...

Isn't this Mr. Hong Dae-young's home?

It is.

I'm Dae-young.

Hey.

Where did you get this phone?

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,280
- Da-jung.
- Stop playing around.

82
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,880
Where did you get this phone?

83
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,720
I know it's hard to believe,

84
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,320
but I'm Dae-young.

85
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,460
On the day I got fired from my job
before our divorce

86
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,030
and I came to your house,

87
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,660
I made a wish saying that I wanted to go
back in time, and I suddenly became young.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,370
My body got younger,

89
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,170
and I pretended to be Go Woo-young

90
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,740
despite being Hong Dae-young.

91
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,310
I'm sorry, Da-jung.

92
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,510
What?

93
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,710
Your body got younger?

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,620
You're really taking this too far.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,790
It's true.

96
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,160
When I went to the stairs at the roof,

97
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,090
I went because I knew that's where you go
when you're having a hard time.

98
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,060
And when I kissed you,

99
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,500
- we were talking about half-moons and--
- Enough already!

100
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,670
There's a limit to what I can let go of.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,570
Please believe in me, Da-jung.

102
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,880
Are you really Hong Dae-young?

103
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,450
Yes, I am.

104
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,090
Then

105
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,690
why did you pretend to be Go Woo-young?

106
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,460
To be honest,

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,670
I wanted to live my life
after my body got young again.

108
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,470
I wanted to play basketball again,

109
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,870
and I wanted to achieve my dreams.

110
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,610
But

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,080
I learned a lot about our kids
while going to school with them.

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,420
They weren't the same Si-a
and Si-woo that I knew.

113
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,890
That's why

114
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,860
I wanted to take care of them

115
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,830
not as their dad but as their friend.

116
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,470
Our kids?

117
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,170
You've lost your mind.
You're speaking complete nonsense.

118
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,540
I'm warning you.

119
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,740
Don't come anywhere near me or my kids.

120

I wanted to help her,

171
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,330
but I guess
I only made things harder for her.

What's with the bankbook?

173

My parents made these when I was born

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,040
and recorded my life in them until now.

175

That's so cool
that you have such a bankbook.

about my parents until now.

I did. I had lunch.

I'll make sure to pay back the rent
that you paid for me.

Yes, it's delicious.

Think of me as your mom from now on.

remind me of my son.

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,270
You always said no to my offer.

335
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Right.

336
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,410
I did say no.

337
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,780
I was just kidding.

338
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,910
If you feel bad about it, I feel bad too.

339
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,480
It's nothing. I'm just envious.

340
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,050
Of what?

341
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,950
You're free and passionate.

342
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,120
You're enjoying your life.
I'm so envious of that.

343
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Really?

344
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,760
I'm going paragliding again this time.

345
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,930
Want to join me?

346
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,500
Really?

347
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,970
Whenever you went paragliding,

348
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,900
I always wanted to go with you.

349
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,070
Join me.

350
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,440
It's my kids.

351
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,380
I can't do anything
that's physically dangerous.

352
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,280
What if I get into an accident?
What about my kids?

353
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,980
They are still in high school.

354
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,750
Gosh. You are indeed a mother.

355
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,620
Forget it. Let's just drink today.

356
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Let's do that.

357
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,770
(Seo Ji-ho)

358
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,150
Whatever.

359
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,010
That's her. Hong Si-a.

360
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,490
What? Gu Ja-sung asked
someone like her to go out with him?

361
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,620
Whatever.

362
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,450
But she dumped him
when she looks like that.

363
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,760
My gosh. She must be
very confident of herself.

364
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,430
She must think she's pretty.

365
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,590
Exactly. She's ridiculous.

366
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,300
- Let's just ignore them.
- Right. Did you know?

367
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
Jung Da-jung.

368
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,230
That's her mom.

369
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,570
I see. That woman who got splashed?

370
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,370
I knew it.
She's trashy just like her mother.

371
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,610
Hey, by the way, she must think

372
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,610
having kids at an early age is
something to brag about.

373
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,180
How can she be on TV?

374
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,880
How humiliating.

375
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,820
Hey, she might hear you.

376
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,350
Seriously.

377
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,120
- What are you doing?
- I can put up with criticisms about me,

378
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,020
but not when they are about my mom.

379
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,260
Let go of me.

380
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,530
- Apologize.
- You must be out of your mind.

381
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,600
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

382
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,500
I badmouthed your mother.
I'm sorry about that.

383
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,910
Hey, are you okay?

384
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,250
Who are you?

385
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,680
Hong Si-a?

386
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,050
You must be out of your mind.

387
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,860
You can't go like this.
Where do you think you're going?

388
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,600
If you want to leave, kneel and apologize.

389
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,730
Then, maybe, I'll consider letting you go.

390
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,430
- Let go of me.
- No.

391
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,430
Are you crazy?

392
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,430
- Gosh.
- Hey.

393
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,940
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

394
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,110
Hey, get them. Get them now!

395
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,840
Hey!

396
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,380
Darn it.

397
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,010
Hey!

398
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,980
Stop right there!

399
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,620
Hey!

400
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,390
Hey!

401
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,060
You're really not going to the PC cafe?

402
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,690
- Let's go.
- I said no.

403
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,330
Let's just go.

404
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,370
Hey, stop them.

405
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,310
What's going on?

406
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,650
It's none of your business.
Get out of my way.

407
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,120
It is my business.

408
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,590
Don't bother Hong Si-a.

409
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,130
If you do, I won't let that slide.

410
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,940
Oh, right.

411
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,970
Don't bother that guy either.

412
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,150
Darn it.

413
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,610
Let's go.

414
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,090
What?

415
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,110
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

416
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,110
I'm okay.

417
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,520
Do I make you

418
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,180
uncomfortable?

419
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,520
No.

420
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,690
You're an awful liar,

421
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,860
Si-a.

422
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,970
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,500
Why are you sorry?

424
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,470
I'm the one who made things uncomfortable

425
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
between us.

426
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,680
But you can forget about what I said.

427
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,780
I don't want to lose our friendship

428
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,120
because of what I said.

429
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,960
Let's go.

430
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,460
Hey, Ji-ho.

431
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,430
Wait up.

432
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,980
Don't just stand there.

433
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,010
Let's go.

434
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
Okay.

435
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,970
My gosh. I'm drunk today.

436
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,600
I called a taxi. Take it when it comes.

437
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,870
By the way,

438
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,010
were you able to make things clear
with Woo-young?

439
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,110
Don't even start.

440
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,480
I thought I made things very clear,

441
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,250
but he crossed the line.

442
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,650
How?

443
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,620
He told me that he's Hong Dae-young.

444
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,530
What?

445
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,600
So what do you think about that?

446
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,670
What do I think?

447
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,540
I just feel bad for Deok-jin.

448
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,250
Da-jung.

449
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,350
You told me that your heart fluttered
because he resembled Dae-young.

450
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,390
Putting aside his looks,

451
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,890
he has Dae-young's voice
and acts like Dae-young.

452
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,290
Even I found that a bit off.

453
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,790
That has never crossed your mind?

454
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,930
Not at all.

455
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,530
It's impossible for people to get young.

456
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,100
Why is that?

457
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,340
I mean, it turns out

458
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,800
there are deities and aliens in our world.

459
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,810
Dae-young could have gotten younger.

460
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,710
You never know what can happen
in our world.

461
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Right.

462
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,650
You are drunk.

463
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,690
The taxi is here. Let's go.

464
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,120
- Hey, I'm really not drunk.
- Hurry.

465
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,530
Hey, I'm not drunk at all.

466
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,490
This is a fact!

467
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Hey.

468
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,140
Sorry for making you wait long.

469
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,470
My grandma is leaving tomorrow.
I was helping her pack.

470
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,310
- She's leaving tomorrow?
- Yes.

471
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,680
Hey, Mom.

472
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,020
Where are you going at this hour?

473
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,990
To the park.
I'm going to practice with Woo-young.

474
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,490
Don't you know what time it is?

475
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,630
Did you call him out?

476
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,230
- No, the thing is...
- From now on,

477
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,600
don't call Si-woo out at a late hour.

478
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,870
It's late, so practice tomorrow.

479
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,440
Let's go, Si-woo.

480
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,610
I'm sorry, Woo-young.

481
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,850
I'll call you later.

482
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,630
Why are you being like that to Woo-young?

483
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,870
If you act cold to him, I'll feel bad.

484
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,770
Si-woo. I'll be honest with you.

485
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,640
I want you to keep
your distance from Woo-young.

486
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
What?

487
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,650
Why must I do that?

488
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,810
It's because...

489
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,320
Maybe it's because he lived abroad
for a long time,

490
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,090
but I feel like he's too open-minded.

491
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,160
What are you talking about?

492
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,100
Did you have that kind of prejudice?

493
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Regardless, it's because I'm worried.

494
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,870
You only hang out
with Woo-young these days,

495
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,070
and you don't meet your other friends.

496
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,270
I don't have any friends to hang out with.

497
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,650
What do you mean?

498
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,350
To be honest,

499
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,520
I was bullied at school.

500
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,130
What?

501
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,260
Why are you telling me that now?

502
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,770
How can I tell you that?

503
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,640
But I'm okay now, so don't worry.

504
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,850
I didn't have friends before,

505
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,050
and I didn't have the courage
to play basketball.

506
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,090
But after I met Woo-young,

507
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,860
a lot has changed for me.

508
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,160
Woo-young

509
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,720
is a really good friend to me.

510
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,930
Are things

511
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,740
okay now?

512
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,430
Yes, they are.

513
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,380
It's all thanks to Woo-young.

514
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,010
- Goodness.
- This must be so heavy.

515
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,150
What? Woo-young.

516
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,810
Didn't you go to school?

517
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,080
I had something to do,
so I left school early.

518
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,060
Is that so? What brings you here?

519
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,990
I heard you were leaving today.

520
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,430
I have to go to the bus terminal too.

521
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,730
The bus terminal?

522
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Yes.

523
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,100
Why do you need to go there?

524
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,070
To see my mom.

525
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,850
(Ticket Office)

526
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,920
Here. One ticket to Gangneung, please.

527
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,290
Thank you.

528
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,770
He must have left.

529
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,180
(Director's Office)

530
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,250
Come in.

531
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,360
I have the final score
for the probationary employees.

532
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,270
What?

533
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
What is this?

534
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,980
Is this correct?

535
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Yes.

536
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,090
Does this make sense?

537
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Newbies.

538
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,850
Gather around.

539
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,820
The results

540
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,300
for the permanent employees just came out.

541
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,250
Excuse me.

542
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,320
What? You didn't leave yet?

543
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Not yet.

544
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,930
Please eat this as you go.

545
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,330
Your luggage is heavy,

546
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,070
so be sure to take a taxi home.

547
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,570
Right. Thank you.

548
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,070
Then

549
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,740
get home safely.

550
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,450
Okay.

551
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
(What do you think?)

552
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,920
Is it good?

553
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,730
Of course it is.

554
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,930
How did you know to buy it for me
every time?

555
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,300
I know it's your favorite.

556
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Here.

557
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,910
When you get to the terminal,
be sure to take a taxi.

558
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,280
Goodness, it's okay. I can take the bus.

559
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,980
Please take a taxi this time.

560
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,620
Also, don't tell Da-jung that I gave you
spending money. Okay?

561
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,590
Goodness gracious.

562
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,390
Thank you.

563
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
No problem.

564
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,530
The results
for the permanent employees just came out.

565
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,840
Thank you for all your work,

566
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,280
Ms. Jung.

567
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,330
It's okay.

568
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,600
Let's finish up

569
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,870
the rest of the week well.

570
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,410
Of course.

571
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,850
Gosh.

572
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,660
Where are you going? Sir!

573
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,870
Director Choi!

574
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,840
Director Moon! What brings you here?

575
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,840
You told the variety show department's
producers to give Ms. Jung a zero!

576
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,210
Ms. Jung didn't make the cut
because of you!

577
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,580
Is that right?

578
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,610
That's great.

579
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,220
What?

580
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,590
You even took her off the show
that you first cast her!

581
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,990
This is going too far.

582
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Exactly!

583
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,230
This shows how lowly your department
thinks of us, the news anchors!

584
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,830
What's with the fuss?

585
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,200
The divorced news anchor with two kids
was a headache to you too.

586
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,070
You should thank me for cutting her out
without causing a scene.

587
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,370
Why are you getting angry at me?

588
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,670
How is she a headache to us?

589
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,370
She's so talented
that she even convinced me!

590
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,210
I'm banning all the news anchors

591
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,580
from being on any of your variety shows!

592
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,450
(Director Choi Hyun-seung)
Darn it!

593
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,050
Come on, Director Moon.

594
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Let go!

595
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,490
Darn you!

596
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,260
Director Moon, you sounded incredible.

597
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,840
Incredible? Nonsense.

598
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,510
I was the one who wanted Ms. Jung out
because she gave me a headache.

599
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,580
Ms. Jung...

600
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,950
All this time that she was working hard
to prove herself,

601
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,850
I never got to tell her that she did well.

602
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,620
I only got to tell her

603
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,820
after she got cut.

604
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,500
- Mr. Heo,
- Yes?

605
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,600
you said that you remember
what I said, right?

606
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,630
Yes.

607
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,770
In this world,

608
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,840
one should be evaluated

609
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,110
purely based on their quality of work,
not by anything else.

610
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
But

611
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,380
I keep forgetting that.

612
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,550
I didn't want to repeat my mistake.

613
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,190
I wanted to get it right this time.

614
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,030
Why are there so many
condescending jerks like me in this industry?

615
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,070
(Jung Da-jung)

616
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,010
Why are you blocking the way?

617
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,500
Is something wrong?

618
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,270
It's nothing.

619
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,170
Why are you here?

620
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,180
Because I miss you.

621
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,280
You're certainly not Hong Dae-young.

622
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,290
Hong Dae-young would never say that.

623
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,030
You didn't

624
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,530
tell the kids that you're Hong Dae-young,

625
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,370
did you?

626
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,940
I didn't.

627
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,080
All right.

628
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,910
I'm grateful to you

629
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,480
for taking care of my kids and me.

630
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,420
But

631
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,560
if you keep coming to me like this,

632
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,590
I think I'll be more worried for my kids

633
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,400
than grateful.

634
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,570
So please,

635
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
let's pretend that none of that happened.

636
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,970
What happened at the party

637
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,610
and the things you said after.

638
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,210
I'm going to forget it all.

639
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,010
So please, do the same

640
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,280
for me and my kids.

641
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:00,890
Okay.

642
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,030
It seems like the rain isn't stopping
anytime soon. Take this umbrella.

643
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,200
- I'm fine.
- Take it.

644
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,540
And

645
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,710
whatever it is,

646
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,580
you must've had a long day,

647
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,810
so just go home and rest.

648
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,450
Sorry?

649
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,590
It's fine.

650
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,090
You've been doing well all along.

651
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,340
It's fine.

652
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,610
You've been doing well all along.

653
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,100
Yes?

654
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,800
I'll head right over.

655
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,580
Are you sure Hong Dae-young is
the guy in the footage?

656
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,590
Yes, I've gotten in touch
with the car owners that parked

657
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,190
near where the accident happened,

658
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,420
looked through their dash cams,
and looked for the man in the footage.

659
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,260
I double-checked with his workplace

660
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,630
about the accident that day too,
so I'm confident.

661
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,370
Could I take a look at the footage?

662
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,600
Sure.

663
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,870
Here.

664
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:13,920
This man is

665
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,190
Da-jung's husband?

666
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,410
Hello?

667
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,240
Is this Hong Dae-young?

668
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,710
Yes, it is. Who is this?

669
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,820
I'd like to meet you in person.

670
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,450
What is this about?

671
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,590
Do you

672
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,130
remember the car accident

673
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,670
that occurred on Christmas Day?

674
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,440
Why did you do that?

675
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,600
Hey, Mom. I'm sorry.

677
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,970
Things got hectic for me.
I couldn't call you.

678
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,800
It's raining. Did you get home safely?

679
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,500
I'm all right. It's not raining here.

680
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,540
And I got to the bus terminal comfortably
because Woo-young helped me.

681
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,740
Woo-young did?

682
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:46,910
(Yes.)

683
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:52,550
But earlier, it felt strange.

684
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,590
Woo-young bought me the red bean buns
from the bus terminal.

685
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,160
I was reminded of Dae-young.

686
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,230
Ms. Jung.

687
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,370
Mom. I'll call you later.

688
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,900
Please sign here.

689
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,540
I'm a fan. Can you give me an autograph?

690
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,880
Okay. Sure.

691
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,480
Thank you.

692
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,760
Actually, I became your fan
because of the guy who bought the shoes.

693
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,690
The guy who bought the shoes?

694
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,760
Yes. It looked like
he was a big fan of yours.

695
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,030
He bragged so much about you,
so I remember him.

696
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,270
You're sending them to a TV station.

697
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,240
"Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung"?

698
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,010
What kind of show is she on?

699
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,420
Don't you know who she is?

700
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Gosh, no.

701
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,820
I'm a huge fan of hers.

702
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,130
She prepared to become an anchor
at a late age.

703
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,060
So whenever she had job interviews,
it must have been hard,

704
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,200
but she didn't give up and kept trying.

705
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,100
So she got the job
with her 24th interview.

706
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,170
I see.

707
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,640
When she worked
as a reporter on a contract,

708
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,410
she went through so much.

709
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,610
How do you know everything about her?

710
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,190
Oh, that. I read that in her interview.

711
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,660
I see. I will look her up too.

712
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,490
Anchorwoman Jung Da-jung.

713
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,790
Yes. You should definitely look her up.

714
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,330
She's a really cool woman.

715
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,130
Afterward,
I've been following your career.

716
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,440
And I started to root for you too.

717
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,070
You must be so happy
to have such a reliable fan like him.

718
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,740
The man who called himself my fan...

719
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,110
Was he a man in his late 30s?

720
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,350
No. He looked like a student.

721
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,580
A student?

722
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,360
Yes.

723
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,660
Please wait here. I'll bring your shoes.

724
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,890
What? I'm fine.

725
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,190
I'm not fine with that.

726
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,530
(I'm not okay with it.)

727
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,830
How can they just let you leave like this?
This is upsetting.

728
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,500
Be strong.
Don't worry about Si-a and Si-woo,

729
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,740
and focus on your work.

730
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,280
I'll take care of the kids at school.

731
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,380
(He's here.)

732
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,250
(Hong Dae-young.)

733
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,980
(I should've been nicer to you.)

734
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,120
"I'm sorry for not taking better care of you."

735
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,760
It's really fine

736
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,960
as long as you're okay.

737
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,830
I'm okay

738
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,160
as long as you're okay.

739
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,400
(How did you know I have indigestion?)

740
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,470
(I get like that when I'm stressed out.)

741
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,940
I can take them out.

742
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,450
Don't do anything. This is my job.

743
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,490
Why are you staring at me?

744
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,460
Because you're pretty.

745
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,730
How beautiful.

746
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,510
(When I went to the stairs at the roof,)

747
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,270
(I went because I knew that's where you go
when you're having a hard time.)

748
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,640
(And when I kissed you,)

749
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,440
(we were talking about half-moons.)

750
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,050
(Hong Dae-young)

751
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,220
Dae-young.

752
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,630
Where are you now?

753
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,430
Well,

754
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,230
I'm...

755
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,170
Stay there.

756
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,640
I'm coming.

757
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,610
Dae-young.

758
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,660
Did you have fun

759
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,330
deceiving me?

760
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,000
If you lied about who you are,

761
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,240
you should have lived your own life.

762
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,980
Why are you hovering around me and nice to me?

763
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,280
If you hid it from me,

764
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,750
you should've hidden it to the end.

765
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,490
Why are you telling me this now?

766
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,520
You said you regretted it.

767
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,430
You regretted meeting me
and ruining your life.

768
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,860
I let you go, so you can live a good life.

769
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,170
I didn't ask you to stay.

770
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,500
But...

771
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,070
But

772
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,210
why are you here again?

773
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,980
Whenever you stayed by my side,

774
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,390
do you know what went through my head?

775
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,890
"I miss you."

776
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,500
"I miss you, Hong Dae-young."

777
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,120
I missed you too.

778

(Epilogue)

779
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,310
I told you, your dad is a good man.

780
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,140
You have a really good opinion of my dad.

781
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,810
Why do you like my dad so much?

Ji-ho, I'm sorry. Okay?

784
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,130
Ji-ho, do you want to run with me?

785
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,030
Hi, Dae-young.
You're going to run another one?

786
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,500
Of course. I have so much energy left.

787
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,370
Ji-ho, you can win this, right?

788
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,070
- Yes!
- Let's go!

Good luck, Ji-ho.

- Good luck!
- Win!

- Go!
