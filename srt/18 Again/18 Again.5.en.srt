00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
(3 months ago)
That's right! A strikeout. I knew Ye Ji-hoon could do it.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,650
My gosh. How can he throw
such clean pitches?

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,820
Ye Ji-hoon! Ye Ji-hoon!

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,860
Yes. That's a curve ball. That's a ball. Nicely done.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
(I can notice his pitches had gotten cleaner since last year.)

(Affidavit for Uncontested Divorce)

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,160
That's another ball. Yes.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,560
All right. You need to relax.
Take your time. All right.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,230
My gosh. I want to watch this
at the stadium. Seriously.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,840
(Year 2001)

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,440
Dae-young, Il-kwon is
just a friend from my church.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,350
I'm sorry. I won't watch a movie
with him ever again.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,820
I'm sorry. Please?

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,490
I love you.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,530
What did you say?

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,400
I said i love you.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,980
Why would you say that?

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
What?

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,650
Why would you say that?

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,850
Well, because...

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,950
I was going to tell you that first.

22
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:17,489
I love you.

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Da-jung.

24
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,570
You are

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,770
my first love.

26
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,700
(That's right.
He does seem calmer than before.)

27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,870
(- Usually, he gets nervous around now.)
- Ye Ji-hoon!

28
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,270
(- Ye Ji-hoon's pitches)
- Gosh, it itches.

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,410
(- can be unpredictable.)
- This is such a fun game to watch.

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
(Affidavit for Uncontested Divorce)

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,000
(Given that you're the one making such a comment,)

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
(Wife: Jung Da-jung)

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,550
He won again. He won the game.

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,920
Seriously. I knew it. He's the best.

35
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,290
Why did you do that?

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,820
Let's get a divorce.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,990
- What?
- Let's get a divorce.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,100
Why would you say that?

39
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,370
- What?
- Why would you say that?

40
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,740
I was going to tell you that first.

41
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,980
That wasn't funny, right?
Your joke isn't funny either.

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't mess around with documents.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,920
I'm not messing around. I mean it.

44
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,720
Forget it. Whatever.

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,090
I'm sorry. Okay?

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,890
I said I'm sorry.

47
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,360
What are you sorry about?

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,529
You don't even know
why you're apologizing.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,230
Do you think saying sorry
can solve everything?

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,570
There you go again.

51
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,970
You're the stubborn one
who won't tell me a thing.

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,710
Are you blaming me for this?

53
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,410
I'll be honest. Whenever you throw
a tantrum like this out of anger,

54
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,310
it drives me insane.
I feel like I'm going crazy!

55
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,250
I'm the one who feels like
I'm going crazy!

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,150
Fine! Let's sign the divorce papers!

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,420
Don't end up regretting it, okay?

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,430
(There are things that you can't turn back.)

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,800
(From the moment you confess your
love until the moment you break up.)

(Husband: Hong Dae-young, Wife: Jung Da-jung)

61
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,270
(Words that hurt each other,)

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,540
(and the regret that follows.)

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,010
(I don't understand)

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
(why)

65
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,410
(we are separating.)

66

=Episode 5, First Love Never Comes True=

67
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,030
(You were never here for us when we needed you.)

68
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,130
(My dad was never there when we needed him.)

69
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,970
(You know when the final hearing is,
right?)

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,640
(Even if you don't come this time,
it's decree absolute.)

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,410
(Let's end it on a good note!)

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,550
Hong Dae-young, you lived in vain.

73
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,340
I told you I quit drinking.

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,680
Why did you come here
if you weren't going to drink?

75
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,490
You didn't sound as good over the phone.

76
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,020
What about you?

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,020
What's wrong with your voice?

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
Da-jung said

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,260
she doesn't need me anymore.

80
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,940
- Seum! Seum!
- Seum! Seum!

81
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,670
How's Si-a?

82
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,240
She just fell asleep.

83
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,040
Thank you for the ride.

84
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,610
No need.

85
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,640
Call me whenever you need me.

86
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,640
Okay.

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,210
Call me when you want to cry too.

88
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Okay.

89
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,190
You did a good job.

90
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,359
You will do well.

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,470
Okay.

92
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,770
(This video became the talk of
the town after it aired.)

93
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,780
(We'll end today's JBC Sports with a clip of Ye Ji-hoon.)

94
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,780
(Thank you, everyone.)

95

(What's the secret to your consistent success?)

96

(- I don't think)
- It's Da-jung.

97
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,350
(there are any secrets...)

98
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,750
Hey, did you see that?

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,090
How did he catch that?

100
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,950
Gosh, he's incredible.

101
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,760
- She's so pretty.
- That was amazing.

102
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,430
Who is that anchorwoman?

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,460
- She's pretty.
- She's a new face in the industry.

104
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,230
(- The best pitcher is different, indeed.)
- That anchorwoman is great.

105
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,500
(I'll move onto the next question.)

106
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,010
Da-jung is living perfectly fine
on her own.

107
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,110
You should start thinking
about yourself too.

108
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,410
How can I do that?

109
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,380
Are you going to go to the final hearing
for your divorce?

110
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,950
No.

111

for the divorce)

112

(Judge)

113
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,130
Is Mr. Hong Dae-young absent today as well?

114
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,340
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Then I will start the ruling.

115
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,960
Woo-young?

116
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,470
(24 hours before the final hearing for the divorce)

117
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,440
(24 hours earlier)

118
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,950
Are you really not going to go to
the final hearing for your divorce?

119
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,379
How can I?

120
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,920
The situation will get worse
if my family finds out.

121
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,160
Right. You made the right choice.

122
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,630
What? She wants a divorce because
you were never there?

123
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,530
Does that make sense?
That's just an excuse.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm telling you it's an affair.

125
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,470
There you go again. That's enough.

126
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,540
It's always the ones you never expect
that end up

127
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,570
stabbing you in the back.

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,370
I told you that was enough.

129
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,070
You're ruining my day already!

130
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,110
Gosh. That's why Da-jung had an affair.

131
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,050
Goodness.

132
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,020
Thank you.

133
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,160
What is this?

134
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,900
My dad

135
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,070
was never there when we needed him.

136
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,010
You didn't eat breakfast, right?

137
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,040
Don't skip breakfast and eat something.

138
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,010
Why are you acting like my dad?

139
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,220
I bought a lot,
so share with your friends.

140
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,590
This is our favorite place these days.

141
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,720
Thanks, SG Boy. We'll enjoy it.

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,920
This is Si-a's favorite.

143
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,390
I know.

144
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,130
How did you know?

145
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,060
Enjoy.

146
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,430
Okay. Thank you.

147
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,370
Woo-young is so caring.

148
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,640
Isn't it good?

149
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,840
It's so good.

150
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,780
It's been so long since I had breakfast.

151
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,720
This is good whenever you eat it.

152
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,920
Let's try something different next time.

153
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,300
No way. We're a good program.
She's perfect for a talk show.

154
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,070
No way. Gosh.

155
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,540
No, she needs to come on
an educational program.

156
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,910
Gosh. Wait.

157
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,140
Can you appear on our educational program?

158
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,580
Ms. Jung Da-jung,
I'm here to cast you for "Shiny Morning".

159
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm here from TPI's talk show.
Please come on our show.

160
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,550
Our producer said he wants you
on our show.

161
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,850
Please consider it.

162
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,390
Please appear on our show.

163
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,990
This is our educational program.

164
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,860
Why is everyone making such a fuss
to cast a mother?

165
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,630
The interview yesterday became
the talk of the town.

166
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,200
She's lucky.

167
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,600
That's all thanks to Ye Ji-hoon.

168
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,200
Luck is part of one's skills.

169
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,170
Either way, Jung Da-jung is the best
among the new anchors.

170
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,540
- Please consider our show.
- Please consider us too.

171
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
(Pardon?)

172
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,740
One person will get fired?

173
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,840
Yes.

174
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,050
After your probationary period, only three
of you will become full-time employees.

175
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,750
I see.

176
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,890
Thank you for telling me.

177
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,990
I should give you some information
since I'm in the anchor department.

178
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,720
But Yu-mi.

179
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,690
You're in fourth place right now.

180
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,900
I'm in fourth place?

181
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,970
Yes.

182
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,670
I saw the producers' score sheet.

183
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,870
At this point, it won't be the baby mother
that'll get fired.

184
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,170
It'll be you.

185
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,870
You know your probationary period
is almost over, right?

186
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,580
Yes, I do.

187
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,250
(Heo Woong-gi)

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,550
Mr. Heo.

189
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,720
I would like to take
half the day off tomorrow.

190
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,720
Why do you need half the day off?

191
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,490
Are you going on a picnic with your kids?

192
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,900
No.

193
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,570
I'm getting

194
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,200
a divorce tomorrow.

195
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,970
What?

196
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,470
A divorce?

197
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,050
(Reason for Divorce,
Looks, Money, Another man)

198
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,620
(Why on earth does she want a divorce?)

199
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,790
(Study Session)

200
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,570
Stop snoring, Hwang Young-seon.

201
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,740
Gosh, Mr. Choi. I'm so sleepy.

202
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,610
I'll wake up if you tell us
about your first love.

203
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,780
First love, my foot. Go wash your face.

204
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,110
Gosh. Tell us about your first love.

205
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,120
First love.

206
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,120
- First love.
- First love.

207
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,650
- First love.
- First love.

208
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,820
- Be quiet. Okay. Enough.
- First love.

209
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,760
Goodness.

210
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,230
Okay then.

211
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,500
My first love

212
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,870
went to high school with me.

213
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,400
I watched a movie with my first love,

214
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,440
and I still can't forget that day.

215
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,650
We will all pray now.

216
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,890
- Amen.
- Let's begin.

217
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,600
Da-jung!

218
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,270
Everyone is watching a movie together.

219
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,240
Would you like to join us?

220
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
A movie?

221
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,270
What movie?

222
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,540
"Bungee Jumping of Their Own".

223
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
Sure.

224
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,680
Everyone canceled last-minute.

225
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,520
- Really?
- Let's just watch anyway.

226
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Sure.

227
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,490
(Somewhere on Earth,)

228
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,830
(stick a needle in,)

229
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,330
(and drop one seed from the sky.)

230
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,400
(The chance of that seed floating down,
landing right on the needle.)

231
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,540
We were so naive.

232
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,810
I could barely even hold her hand.

233
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,520
I wonder what would've happened
had I held her hand that day.

234
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,920
That's so sad.

235
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,890
Poor you.

236
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,690
But actually,

237
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,260
I've been seeing my first love again.

238
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,430
(Again?)

239
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,660
(Study Session)

240
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,460
Quiet!

241
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,460
Get back to studying now.

242
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,530
Yes, sir.

243
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,870
(Reason for divorce)

244
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,850
Don't you think Mr. Choi is so handsome
and so pure?

245
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,260
I hope things work out
with his first love.

246
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,890
- What?
- Come on.

247
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,930
First loves never work out.

248
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,460
(First love never works out.)

249
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,270
(Maybe that's why I'm getting divorced.)

250
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,970
Why? Your parents were also
each other's first love.

251
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,770
No, Mom said that Dad isn't
her first love.

252
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,910
What?

253
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,640
He's not her first love?

254
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,980
Goodness.

255
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Sorry.

256
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,880
I heard that they were
each other's first love.

257
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,390
Mr. Go surely talks a lot.

258
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,460
Anyway, my mom's first love isn't Dad.

259
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,900
I see.

260
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,740
Her first love

261
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,880
was someone else.

262
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,920
Who is her first love, then?

263
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,620
Well...

264
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,490
Mom,

265
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,900
who's your first love?

266
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,630
Dad.

267
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,630
What? You said that he wasn't.

268
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,200
Not your dad. My dad.

269
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,840
That's lame.

270
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,610
Why? Your first love is Dad, isn't it?

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,110
I'd take anyone who's not like Dad.

272
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,310
That's amazing.

273
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,820
Come on.

274
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,990
So, they're each other's first love.

275
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,920
They say that first love never works out,

276
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:52,190
but those two did.

277
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,769
I guess first love never works out.

278
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,210
(Da-jung I'm here.
I'm waiting at the cafe.)

279
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,250
(Yes, I'm almost there. See you soon.)

280
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,520
Woo-young!

281
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,390
Did something happen to him?

282
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,180
Goodness.

283
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,550
- Give it to me.
- I'm fine.

284
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,880
Just give it to me.

285
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Woo-young, I can go on my own from here.

286
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you.

287
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,570
Get yourself some tteokbokki with this.

288
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,510
It's fine.

289
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,220
He's kind,

290
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,880
but a little sassy.

291
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,130
This is so annoying.

292
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,460
Should I tell her that it's me?

293
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,820
(What are you doing, Da-jung?
Are you really cheating on me?)

294
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,640
I'm here.

295
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,210
Hong Dae-young.

296
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,630
(14 hours before the final meeting
for divorce)

297
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,570
What are you doing?

298
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,270
You looked exhausted

299
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,810
when you were walking here.

300
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,010
My heart ached just watching that.

301
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm fine,

302
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,140
so don't do that from now on.

303
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,050
All right. I'm sorry.

304
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,550
Let's sit first.

305
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,260
Please don't take my hug the wrong way.

306
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,460
I'm really just worried about you.

307
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,670
Why did you want to see me?

308
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,530
Right.

309
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,040
This is for Si-a's hospital bill.

310
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,170
I wanted to give this to you.

311
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,740
It's fine.

312
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,080
It was your daughter, not just anyone.

313
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,550
I can't take it.

314
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,350
I appreciate it,
but I don't feel comfortable.

315
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,450
Sure.

316
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,590
All right, then.

317
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,790
It's only going to get harder
from your divorce.

318
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,160
Just give me a call when you need a man.

319
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,560
Is he out of his mind?

320
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,430
Need what?

321
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,440
Don't take it the wrong way.

322
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,070
I'm just saying, call me if you need
anyone to carry heavy things for you.

323
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,810
I won't be needing a man.

324
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,310
I guess you hate men after Hong Dae-young.

325
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,850
Did he cheat on you?

326
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,620
Or do you just not love him anymore,

327
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,820
because he's uneducated
and has a low-paying job?

328
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,960
Stop it.

329
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,460
Dae-young was a great father
to the family.

330
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,260
He doesn't deserve your trash talk.

331
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
What?

332
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,600
This is getting too unpleasant for me.
I should go.

333
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,750
Seriously?

334
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,590
What are you doing?

335
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,490
Stop.

336
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,430
I told you to stop!

337
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm leaving.

338
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,070
(One, two, three.)

339
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,140
(One, two, three.)

340
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,910
She's ignoring me again.

341
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,410
Does she think
that she's still young or something?

342
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,490
I see. Your first love? Is she pretty?

343
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,620
Well, you know,

344
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,130
she's still beautiful.

345
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,160
Hey, let's use her for our bet.

346
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,360
Your first love.

347
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,940
No, drop it.

348
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,540
She's a mom.

349
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,340
And she's getting a divorce too.

350
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,080
Then, isn't that easier?

351
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,580
Hey. You know what? I'm going to bet

352
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,080
it will take a month.

353
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,850
I'll double it for three weeks.

354
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,020
I'll double that too.

355
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,620
My gosh. Seducing a divorced mom
isn't that hard.

356
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,820
Okay. I'm in.

357
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,590
Da-jung.

358
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,260
You were amazing today.

359
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,300
Okay.

360
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,900
Thank you.

361
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,540
I can win her over soon
if I keep acting like a gentleman.

362
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,980
(Da-jung, I already paid
for Si-a's medical bill.)

363
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,420
(Don't worry about it.)

364
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,720
(You must have been scared. Get some rest.)

365
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,360
Darn it.

366
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,910
Hey, you're here. All right.

367
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,610
Oh, right. What happened?

368
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,180
Your first love. Did you win her over?

369
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,820
You're right.
It's already been three weeks.

370
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,520
You know that I doubled on the bet, right?

371
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,660
Hey, let's say that I lost this one.

372
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,330
Here.

373
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,360
Come on.

374
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,070
Why are you giving up so easily?
Gosh, thank you for that.

375
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,800
Your days are over, Il-kwon.

376
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,140
You can't even seduce a divorced mom.

377
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,540
Hey, it wasn't that I couldn't.
I chose not to seduce her.

378
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,040
I have to want to play the game.

379
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,850
When I tried to seduce a divorced mom,
I felt like I was torturing myself.

380
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,350
You know what?
You should go double next time.

381
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,820
There's a teacher at my school

382
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,890
who makes me want to win over.

383
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,490
Sure. Let's do that.

384
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,160
- Anyway, thanks for the drinks today.
- All right. Okay.

385
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,060
Hey, pour me the drink.

386
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,670
- Are you working late too?
- Get lost.

387
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,380
How could your friend, Dae-young,
be so busy lately?

388
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,650
Why can't we reach him
when his own daughter is sick?

389
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,620
Then, what about
your awesome friend, Da-jung?

390
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,420
Why is she divorcing him for
not being there when he was busy working?

391
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,720
Don't you remember the school reunion?

392
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,760
It's crystal clear
that he was at fault there.

393
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,730
Why would you bring up
the school reunion here?

394
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,500
- It's a lovers' quarrel.
- What's wrong with them?

395
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,700
- Do you really have no clue?
- I don't.

396
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,570
What is it? Can you tell me?

397
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,840
- Weren't you at the school reunion?
- No.

398
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,980
I didn't go either.

399
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,580
Gosh. But after hearing
what happened from Da-jung,

400
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,650
I was in utter shock.

401
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,770
Dae-young.

402
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,940
Why did you do that to Da-jung?

403
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,110
What are you talking about?

404
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,140
The school reunion.

405
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,750
Don't you remember?

406
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,850
The school reunion?

(Serim High School Reunion for Class 20)

- Cheers. Nice to see you.
- Cheers.

410
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,230
Oh, right. I have a new business card.
Take one, everyone.

411
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,000
- Gosh.
- All right.

412
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,700
- Nice.
- Here.

413
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,270

(Hong Dae-young,

415

Do you still work here?

416
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,080
Don't you know I'm nothing
without my resolution?

417
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,880
Hey, can you give me a good price?

418
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,010
For a repair job?

419
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,780
The travel fee isn't that much.

420
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,280
I wasn't talking to you.

421
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,250
Can you give me a good price
for a dental implant?

422
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,850
How can I give you a discount for that?

423
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,190
You got promoted.

424
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,420
I bet your annual salary went up by a lot.

425
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,760
Use that money for the dental implant.

426
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,360
Min-sik, did you get promoted?
Congratulations!

427
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,700
- Thank you.
- I'm up for a promotion too.

428
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,770
Okay. Drink up.

429
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,340
Hey, I heard that juridical scriveners
make a lot of money these days.

430
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
You must be making a lot.

431
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,310
Gosh. I don't make that much.

432
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,280
How much do you make?

433
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,380
Well,

434
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,910
I make more than you.

435
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,720
So how much do you make?

436
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,720
Gosh, fine.

437
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,290
So you'll stop pestering me
once I pay for the drinks, right?

- Is that all?
- Should there be more?

- You're the best.
- You're so cool.

- Hi.

460

It's been a while.

461
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,440
Goodness. Da-jung,

462
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,540
you were pretty back then.
And you are still

You got procedures done, right?

Why do I look so old?

470
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,760

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,850
does it feel better about your lives?

I told you I was sorry.
Don't be upset. Okay?

If you're that sorry,

485

turn it back.

486

- What?
- Turn back the time

487

- What?

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,700
What a loser.

490
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,340
Did he drink a lot?

491
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,440
- What are you
- He's such a loser.

492
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,440
saying right now?

493
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,710
I'm saying I regret it.

494
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,150
Are you

495
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,090
telling me that you regret meeting me?

496
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,890
Yes. I do.

497
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,720
Ever since I met you,

498
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,960
I'm going through all sorts of hardships.
And I'm mocked and laughed at.

499
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,330
How can I not regret it?

500
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,660
I

501
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,570
didn't want to live like this either.
Did you know that?

502
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,750
You regret it too,

503
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,950
don't you?

504
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,220
Even if he does, how could he
say something like that to her?

505
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,750
He's so mean.

506
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,800
Did you

507
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,100
regret it?

508
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,360
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

509
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,790
Oh, my.

510
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,290
She knew that you lied
about your business trip to Busan.

511
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,330
Da-jung said

512
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,130
she couldn't trust you anymore.

513
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,220
Why won't you tell me?

514
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,490
If telling you would change things,
I would've done so already.

515
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,560
Don't do something you'll regret.

516
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Regret?

517
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,230
You can regret it.

518
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,340
(When I said I regretted meeting Da-jung,)

519
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,940
(I wasn't being honest.)

520
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,310
(However,)

521
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,380
(it's true I blamed her.)

522
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,820
(If I look back,)

523
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,320
(it was all my fault.)

524
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm here.

525
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,540
Hong Dae-young's

526
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,470
proxy.

527
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,410
Mr. Hong Dae-young couldn't make it today,

528
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,380
so he informed us that he would send a proxy.

529
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,150
Does Mr. Hong's proxy have anything to say?

530
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,630
Sir, if you don't have anything to say...

531
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,930
I do have something to say.

532
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,030
(Judge)

533
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,770
This is a letter that Mr. Hong
asked me to give her.

534
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,040
He asked that I read this here.

535
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,230
Okay, please read it out loud.

536
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
"Da-jung."

537
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,060
"I don't think I can tell you in person."

538
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,900
"First of all,"

539
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,170
"I'll do as you say when it comes to"

540
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,540
"custody and child support."

541
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,710
"I finally realized why you wanted
to get a divorce."

542
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,580
"I regret what happened"

543
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,150
"at our high school reunion,
but I won't make excuses."

544
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
Da-jung.

545
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,950
You're an amazing person,

546
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,750
and you're more than I deserve.

547
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,720
I don't want you to be discouraged.

548
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,190
I want you

549
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,130
to be bright wherever you are.

550
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,500
Don't get hurt.

551
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,770
Don't overwork yourself.

552
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,910
Also...

553
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,080
To be honest,

554
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,020
I don't want to let you go.

555
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,190
Of all the decisions
I have to make in life,

556
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,990
I will regret this the most.

557
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,760
But

558
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,770
I hope you can live without any regrets.

559
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,840
I'll be the one to regret it.

560
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,550
Thank you for everything.

562
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,490
Be happy, Da-jung.

563
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,450
The plaintiff and the defendant
will get divorced.

564
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,290
Custody will be given to the plaintiff.

(Courthouse)

566
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,860
Your dad and I got divorced.

567
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,030
(I regret it.)

568
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,770
Tell me.

569
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,440
(Hong Dae-young)

570
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,740
- Hurry up.
- Play!

571
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,210
- Pass the ball!
- What is he doing?

572
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,680
- What's wrong with him?
- What's happening?

573
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,380
(If I didn't tell him...)

574
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,550
Da-jung, let's look at our reality.

575
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,120
Da-jung, if you regret this later...

576
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,360
(- If he didn't hold onto me...
- No.)

577
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,760
I didn't want to live like this either.

578
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Did you know that?

579
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,570
You regret it too,

580
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,770
don't you?

581
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,310
(...we wouldn't have been so unhappy.)

582
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:01,290
(Now, I just need to let him go
without regrets.)

583

(Hello, Da-jung.)

587
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,590
(Hello?)

588
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Mom.

589
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,530
(Da-jung?)

590
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,930
I'm sorry.

591
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
I

592
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,010
got a divorce.

593
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm sorry.

594
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,180
Hello.

595
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,120
- Hello.
- Hi.

596
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,290
Hello.

597
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,760
Hello, Mr. Heo.

598
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,330
Ms. Jung.
Did you finalize your divorce well?

599
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,500
Oh, yes. Of course.

600
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,670
Alright. A divorce is a divorce.

601
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,410
Your personal life shouldn't interfere
with work.

602
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,010
Yes, sir. Of course.

603
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,480
Okay. Then bring six coffees
to the conference room.

604
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,510
Yes, sir.

605
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,390
How can she be so calm
when she just got divorced?

606
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,990
Get to work!

607
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,110
Mr. Heo is cruel. He always makes you
run errands.

608
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,580
It's a lot to take, isn't it?

609
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,180
I'm fine.

610
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,190
Can I call you Da-jung?

611
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,650
Sure.

612
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,860
Why don't we take a selfie
to celebrate this new chapter

613
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,390
of our friendship?

614
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,790
Why a selfie?

615
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,230
One, two, three.

616
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,610
(My favorite colleague, Da-jung.)

617
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,940
(It's amazing how strong you're holding up
after your divorce.)

618
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,310
(Cheers!)

619
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,680
(New Post)

620
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,790
At this point, it won't be the baby mother
that'll get fired.

621
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,020
It'll be you.

622
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,160
I can't let that happen.

623
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,390
(It's amazing how strong you're holding up
after your divorce.)

(Hong Si-a, are you coming to school?)

626
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,940
(Why wouldn't I?)

627
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,080
Is she really okay?

628
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,890
Close the gate now!

629
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,890
Ji-ho, get inside.

630
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,430
What are you doing?

631
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,430
Sorry, I just need to tie my shoe.

632
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,300
What are you doing?

633
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,630
Right.

634
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,770
I got something for you.

635
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,240
What?

636
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,840
You're top of the class.
You must be busy studying.

637
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,410
You shouldn't have.

638
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,940
What is it?

639
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,050
Thank you for everything, always.

640
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,220
You're too nice.

641
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,990
Head inside.

00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,490

643
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,030
It's love.

644
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,670
What are you doing? Close the gate!

645
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,170
Close it fast.

646
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,010
- Stop!
- Sir.

647
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,840
- Just let us off the hook just this once.
- Please.

648
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,340
I'm a cold person.

649
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,410
- Lock the gate.
- Please!

650
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,120
- Hong Si-a!
- Hong Si-a!

651
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,450
- Hong Si-a!
- Hong Si-a!

652
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,420
- Good morning!
- Missed you!

653
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,520
Come here.

654
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,730
- I didn't fart.
- Then who was it?

655
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,760
Gosh.

656
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,960
- That's amazing.
- That's weird.

657
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:10,970
What should we eat today?

658
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,030
- Shaved ice.
- Ice cream.

659
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,730
- What?
- I want shaved ice.

660
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,240
What do you say to shaved ice?

661
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,540
We're not having shaved ice.

662
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,640
- Yes, we are.
- Bring it on.

663
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,940
- Oh, no.
- Hey! Come here!

664
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,740
Come here, you!

665
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,910
- Come here. Let's have ice cream!
- I'm here.

666
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,950
No...way

667
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,510
No way.

668
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,910
This is Hong Si-a's mom, right?

669
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,280
It is! It's her mom.

670
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,050
I can't believe it.

671
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,490
Quiet. Si-a is over there.

672
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,130
What is it?

673
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,230
What a nuisance.

674
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,760
Si-a.

675
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,230
Why?

676
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,750
("JBC's New Anchor Jung Da-jung Is Divorced")

677
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,610
Goodness.

678
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,520
This is a disaster.

679
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,650
I uploaded it,

680
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,090
but deleted it right away.

681
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,490
But I guess news reporters saw it.

682
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,300
What should I do? I'm sorry.

683
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,970
It's fine. People were
bound to find out one day.

684
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,300
It should've been stalled
for as long as possible.

685
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,970
The news is already out.
There's nothing I can do.

686
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,710
I have a shoot, so I'll get going now.

687
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,810
I'm so sorry, Da-jung.

688
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,990
Do you think she did that on purpose?

689
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,660
No way.

690
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,950
That must be the fried chicken.
Can you get the door?

691
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,020
All right.

692
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,430
Woo-young, you!

Ms. Ok!

694
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,700
It's a misunderstanding. It's not mine.

695
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,170
See? I told you that you wouldn't be
able to quit drinking.

696
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,040
But that's okay. You deserve a beer
after today.

697
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,280
Ms. Ok.

698
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,350
What brings you here?

699
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,780
How can you drink
when your father is home?

700
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,420
He just had a long day.

701
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,490
It's my dad's.

702
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,760
You must've been surprised.
We drink together sometimes.

703
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,660
Just a light beer to toast
to our love and friendship.

704
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,360
You mean, our father-son bond,
not friendship.

705
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,730
Yes, our father-son bond.

706
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,600
So, an underaged student has
a drinking problem already?

707
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:12,410
I was just kidding!

708
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,640
- Right, Woo-young?
- Of course.

709
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,510
I just sit there and watch him drink.

710
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,780
I just find it so pathetic
when he drinks alone.

711
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,280
I'm his only friend.

712
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,580
Yes, I have no friends.

713
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,720
What?

714
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,690
Just go with it.

715
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,660
- Sir?
- Yes?

716
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,360
We need to talk.

717
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,080
I just need to ask you something.

718
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,110
Go ahead.

719
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,450
What kind of a day is it today
that Woo-young can't come to school,

720
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,520
and has to drink?

721
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:58,950
The day of divorce.

722
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,520
- The day of divorce?
- Yes.

723
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,590
Yes, Woo-young...

724
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,790
No, I mean,

725
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:10,000
not me, either.

726
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,500
You know what? I wonder as well.

727
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,940
Why didn't he go to school today?

728
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,970
Mr. Go,

729
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,140
are you unaware of what's going on
in Woo-young's life,

730
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,180
or are you not saying anything
because you don't trust me?

731
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:25,880
Neither.

732
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,010
What?

733
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,480
If I had to choose, though,

734
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,750
I'll go with the former.

735
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,820
I'm very disappointed in you, then.

736
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:33,820
Sorry?

737
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,790
No matter how busy you are,
I plead that as his dad,

738
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,630
you at least look after his drinking issue
and him attending school.

739
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,960
I'll keep an eye out for him as well.
Bye now.

740
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,400
Ms. Ok?

741
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,240
I should've chosen the latter.

742
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,850
Did it all work out?

743
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,150
Whatever.

744
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,390
What's wrong with him?

745
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,960
Why did you skip school? You're a student!

746
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,230
What's he saying?

747
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,440
Hello! It's been so long.

748
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,770
Oh, my. You're right!

749
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,340
I haven't seen your roommate
in so long, either.

750
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,940
What? I live alone.

751
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,150
I'll head in now.

752
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,320
That's not true.

753
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,490
I saw another woman come out
of that house.

754
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,270
Yes. What?

755
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,840
Should we go for a round today?

756
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,640
Wait there.

757
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,710
Okay.

758
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,850
She does have a roommate.

759
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,420
What took you so long?

760
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,060
Are you the last one to arrive
because you're the oldest?

761
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,090
Yes.

762
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,000
Hurry and be my sniper. Gosh.

763
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,730
All right. Let me set it up first.

764
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,730
Okay.

Sounds like a nuisance.)

go for a limited edition.)

- Exactly.
- Those brats. Hey!

Why are you so interested in her life?

What's her deal? She's making it worse.

How do they know
that her parents split up?

What do you think?
They read it in the news articles.

The bag popped.

What?

00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,140
Darn it.

801
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,640
I should bring a new bag.

802

I heard your parents split up.

It's just that we don't talk about it.

807

But a lot of families split up these days.

808
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,070
It's the same with my parents.

Don't let that get to you.

As if.

812
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,710
I'm fine.

No. Someone is in there.

Let's go somewhere else.

00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,240
I know what you're going through.

819
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,010
What is this? Who did this?

820
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,880
I did.

821
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,240
It's you again?

822
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,150
Gosh. Clean it up now.

823
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,880
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

824
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,380
Oh, my.

825
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,920
Goodness.

826
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,870
("JBC's New Anchor Jung Da-jung Is Divorced")

827
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,500
(When I see her on TV,
I'll only remember that she's divorced.)

828
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,910
(Newest comments)
(She had a good image. I'm liking her less and less.)

829
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,610
(Getting a divorce is understandable.)

830
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,280
(People are so nosy.)

831
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,910
(How can she publicly
announce her divorce?)

832
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,110
(Is she that honest or dumb?)

833
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,760
Yes, Ae-rin.

834
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,860
Oh, my. You sound so down.

835
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,360
Is it because of the news article?

836
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:01,300
I'm worried that
my kids might read the comments.

837
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,270
I'll give you the documents you asked for.
Where should we meet?

838
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,340
I'll go to your office after work.

839
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:10,610
See you later.

840
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,740
Okay.

841
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,860
Come in.

842
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Ms. Ok.

843
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,030
Gosh. Hello, Mr. Go.

844
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,400
I know you were very disappointed
in me yesterday.

845
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,500
I'm sorry.

846
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,700
As a token of my apology,
I brought a present for you.

847
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,770
A gold helmet. It's a limited edition.

848
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,670
(What? There are only three
of them in Korea.)

849
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,140
There are only three of them in Korea.

850
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,410
And I have all three.

851
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,440
Pardon?

852
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:49,950
(He's Tony Starku?)

853
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,650
I wanted to show you how sorry I am.

854
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
Please accept it.

855
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,150
I appreciate the thought,

856
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,690
but I cannot accept this.

857
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,320
Why not? Do you not like it?

858
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,360
No. It's not that.

859
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,260
I cannot accept anything
from parents due to legal reasons.

860
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,960
I'm sorry.

861
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,640
- Ms. Ok.
- Mr. Choi.

862
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:26,820
Wait...

863
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,120
Move! Out of my way!

864
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,990
Who was that weirdo?

865
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,130
He's a bit off-the-wall.

866
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,030
I have a class. So I must get going.

867
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,080
Something was in your hair.

868
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
I see.

869
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,390
Gosh. That tiny girl is
playing hard-to-get.

870
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,060
I get it. That will make this more fun.

871
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,740
Si-woo!

872
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,950
You were out for two days.

873
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,250
What happened?

874
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,050
Nothing.

875
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,690
Are you all right?

876
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,750
Me?

877
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,760
I'm fine.

878
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
Okay.

879
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,660
We should get ready for the tryout.

880
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,360
Let's practice today.

881
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:46,930
Sure.

882
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,550
If you want to ruin anything,
just ruin your life.

883
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,480
Don't ruin that poor girl's life.

884
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,150
Call that girl now.
Let's take her to the hospital.

885
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,320
Hey! No parents would want
to ruin their children's lives!

886
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,400
You sound like you actually care about me.

887
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,500
You punk.

888
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,040
If you leave now,

889
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,340
I will disown you!

890
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Grandpa.

891
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,420
Hey, how have you been?

892
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,190
Grandpa!

893
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,390
Come here.

894
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,030
You've grown.

895
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,360
Did you have a good day?

896
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,430
Yes.

897
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,100
You studied hard, right?

898
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,000
- I tried my best.
- You did?

899
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,740
Good job.

900
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,180
By the way, who is he?

901
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,890
He's my friend.

902
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,620
- Your friend?
- Yes.

903
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:31,200
You...

904
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,910
You don't look like
you listen to your parents.

905
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,750
Let's practice tomorrow.
I have to get going.

906
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,890
- Okay.
- Let's go.

907
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,720
- What do you want to eat? Really?
- I want to eat snack bar food.

908
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,930
That sounds good. Let's go.

909
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:02,070
- Dig in.
- Thank you.

910
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,740
I heard from your mother.

911
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,670
This must be tough on you guys.

912
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,970
It's okay.

913
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,170
Don't worry about us.

914
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
Eat up.

915
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,850
- Get home safely.
- We'll visit you next time.

916
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,750
- Okay. Get home safely.
- Okay.

917
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,650
- Bye.
- Bye.

918
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:30,690
(Snack Bar)

919
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,800
(Priority Seat)

920
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,240
- Bye.
- All right.

921
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,580
You should do that later, okay?

922
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:26,320
- Okay.
- Okay. Drive safe.

923
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,290
Hello?

924
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,200
Hey, come to my office now.

925
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,660
Why? What is it?

926
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,470
You'll know once you come.

927
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,970
If you don't, you'll regret it.
You'd better come.

928
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,610
Gosh. What is this about now?

929
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,850
I signed everything.

930
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,250
We're done, right?

931
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,260
Yes, we are.

932
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,190
But can you stay a bit longer?

933
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,490
My son is a huge fan of yours.

934
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,360
I called him to come here without
telling him why. But he's not here yet.

935
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,100
When will he be there?

936
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,300
In 10 minutes.

937
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,270
Wait. 20 minutes? 30 minutes?

938
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,740
I'm sorry.

939
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,740
We should take a rain check
for your surprise.

940
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,940
Then, can you give me your autograph?

941
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,210
Sure.

942
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,320
- What's his name?
- Hong Dae-young.

943
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:07,950
Wait, no.

944
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,420
Go Woo-young?

945
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,720
Should I get one under Hong Dae-young?

946
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,660
Pardon?

947
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,690
Make it to Go Woo-young, please.

948
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,560
Go Woo-young.

949
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:33,880
Ms. Jung?

950
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:38,210
- Mr. Ye.
- What brings you here?

951
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,190
I'm going home after seeing my friend.

952
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,120
Gosh, what a small world.

953
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,890
Funny running into you here.

954
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,740
There are a lot of news articles
about you.

955
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,640
Did you read them?

956
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,970
How could I not?

957
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:06,540
Whenever people saw me,
that's all they talked about.

958
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,780
People talked about that with you?

959
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,850
It's my problem. Why?

960
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:15,890
Well, you were in the video too.

961
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:17,790
But I was the highlight of the video.

962
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:22,730
I see. You mean the articles
about the interview?

963
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,060
I'm sorry.

964
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,300
I mixed it up with another article.

965
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,760
Another article?

966
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,430
Oh, yes. I read it.

967
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,970
Congratulations

968
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,910
on your divorce.

969
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,310
Pardon?

970
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,880
All of the players
who started afresh after

971
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,820
making a debut or switching to
another team with my blessing did well.

972
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:52,420
I'm sure things will work out for you too.

973
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,260
That

974
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,830
applies to divorces too, right?

975
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,160
Yes.

976
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:00,760
A divorce

977
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,930
is a new start too.

978
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,340
Lately, I've only been criticized
for my divorce.

979
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,140
This is new.

980
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,480
Ms. Jung!

981
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:23,790
Woo-young.

982
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,390
What are you doing here?

983
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,160
To see my dad.

984
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,570
Who is he?

985
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:37,800
He's my friend's son.

986
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,000
Excuse me.

987
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,540
If you're busy, you can go.

988
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,540
I'll say bye to Ms. Jung for you.

989
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,690
I should say that to you.
If you're busy, you can go.

990
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,360
I'll say bye to her for you.

991
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:00,790
Yes.

992
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,860
It doesn't matter.

993
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,960
I'm going to leave with her.

994
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,030
But

995
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,570
why do you keep dropping honorifics to me?

996
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:15,410
What?

997
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,940
Let's not be so casual
when we met for the first time today.

998
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:08,360
(Observation report 12)

999
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,460
(At 10:05 p.m.,)

1000
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,290
(he seemed depressed after the divorce.)

1001
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:19,300
(At 7:48 a.m., he went to school.)

1002
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,600
(I can't find out about his school life.)

1003
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,370
(At 5:15 p.m.,)

1004
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,680
(he met a new character.
Possibly his family.)
