1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,750
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,820
Serim!

00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,290
(Go Woo-young)

4
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,290
Are you going home now?

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,590
Yes.

6
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,090
Wasn't Si-woo amazing today?

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,900
He's been better.

8
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,170
I see.

9
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,570
Right. Congratulations
on winning the game today.

10
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,680
Hold on.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,850
Your shoelace came undone.

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,589
- I can get that.
- I'm done.

13
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:23,330
I tied it twice,

14
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,430
so it doesn't get loose.

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,480
I heard when your shoelace comes undone,

16
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,210
it means you have met the one.

17
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,680
I tied it twice, so it doesn't get loose.

18
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,950
I'm done.

19
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,530
Get home safely.

20
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,330
Okay. I will.

21
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,670

(Do you want to become young again?)

25
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,610
Hey, Da-jung.

26
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,140
I'm glad that you got to
watch Si-woo's last game of his life.

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,640
What do you mean?

28
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,650
I thought the team advanced
to the next round.

29
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,020
My team did advance to the next round,

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,450
but players like Si-woo will
only play these preliminary games.

31
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,120
Players who have shown me gratitude
ought to play in important games.

32
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,560
How could you?

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,590
Aren't you ashamed to face
your hardworking players?

34
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,100
Gosh.

35
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,070
Anyway, before I decide on my lineup
for the next game,

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm going to hold
one more parent-teacher conference.

37
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,870
If this is your attitude,

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,370
we have nothing to discuss.

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,640
If you change your mind,

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
call me.

(is waiting to hear from you.)

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,500
Gi-tae, can "On the Site, 25 Hours"

47
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,970
handle topics such as
bribery for college admission?

48
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,170
Of course, as long as there are
witnesses and evidence,

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,470
we'd start right away.

- Boss!
- Hey!

52
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,170
I told you not to call me that.

53
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,640
- I'm sorry.
- How many times do I have to tell you?

54
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,750
Table for how many?

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,850
I'm here to see your boss.

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,080
Is he inside?

57
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,150
Pardon?

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,459
How do you know my boss?

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,620
I'm Il-kwon's friend.

60
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,830
I see. I don't think he's coming in today.

61
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,030
Do you want me to call him?

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,030
No. I'll call him myself.

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Okay.

64
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,400
I checked, and I think it is Choi Il-kwon.

65
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,500
I'll look into it some more.

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,900
Okay. Thank you.

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
Yes.

68
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,180
Okay. I'll be there soon.

69
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Honey.

70
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,690
I'm going to step out for a bit.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,820
- Are you just getting here, son?
- Yes.

72
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,190
Oh, right. When was the main game again?

73
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,459
Don't get your hopes up.

74
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,200
If the starting lineup changes, I might
not be able to play in the main game.

75
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,800
What?
Why would the starting lineup change?

76
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,870
I don't know.

77
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,640
Choi Il-kwon. Congratulations on
sending your kids to the finals.

78
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,610
Gosh, high school finals isn't
something to congratulate me about.

79
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,620
I'm going to move up
to the college league next year,

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
so I'm not really that impressed.

81
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,390
Oh, right.

82
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,890
They decided on someone else
for that position.

83
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,730
Wait.

84
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,460
What?

85
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,530
We had no choice.

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,940
You're not upset, right?

87
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,270
Why would I be?

88
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,280
If a position at Hankuk University
opens up, I'll make you coach.

89
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,850
Just stay in the high school league
until then.

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
That's right. Okay?

91
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,150
Okay.

92
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,620
Oh, Mr. Bang. You're finally here.

93
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,390
Right. Come over here.

94
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,990
They are the coaches at Hankuk University.

95
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,900
They're going to help Gi-yong a lot
when he goes to college,

96
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,660
so I thought it'd be nice
for you to meet them.

97
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh, I see. Hello.

98
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,270
Hello. We heard a lot about Gi-yong.

99
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,000
Right. Thank you.

100
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,810
- Please take good care of him.
- But

101
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
it's too late tonight.

102
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,010
It's too bad, but let's make plans
to meet another time.

103
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,420
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Bang.

104
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,490
Mr. Bang.

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,790
We enjoyed our drinks today,
and you don't need to worry about Gi-yong.

106
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,990
Understand?

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,760
Thank you. Goodness.

108
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,980
Hey.

109
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,880
Next time, be sure to secure me a spot.

110
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,420
Of course.
We'll make sure of it for next time.

111
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,420
- Right.
- Do me the favor.

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,690
- We'll get going.
- I'm serious.

113
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,760
My gosh.

114
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,870
What?

115
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,310
(- It's me, Hong Dae-young.)
- Hello?

116
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,710
What?

117
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,310
Hong Dae-young?

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,540
(Gosh.)

119
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,780
What brings you to call me?

120
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,950
Choi Il-kwon.

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
(I heard everything.)

122
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,190
Really?

123
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,930
So what?

124
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,930
Isn't making a living teaching basketball,
the sport you love, enough for you?

125
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,130
Why are you trying to make money
off of the kids?

126
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,170
The sport I love?

127
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,800
Who?

128
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,200
Me?

129
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,070
All throughout high school and college,
I gave tens of thousands to my coaches

130
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,839
for a chance to play a game,

131
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,209
but I was always on edge worried
that I would get kicked out.

132
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,550
If you know that feeling,
that's more of a reason not to do this.

133
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,420
Why are you trying to live like them?

134
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,150
Hey. Shouldn't I get to reap
as much as I sowed,

135
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,290
(you jerk?)

136
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,560
Even though I lived my life getting money
to have kids play,

137
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,790
don't you think
I'm living better than you?

138
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,030
(How dare someone as foolish as you
try to lecture me?)

139
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,030
Goodbye!

140
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,570
Gosh, why are things like this today?

141
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,610
Are you Gi-yong's father?

142
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,750
Who are you?

143
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,920
I'm Si-woo's mom. I called you before.

144
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,690
You said you were busy, so I came to you.

145
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,760
We'll take care of our son,
so don't worry about us.

146
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,840
(I want to gather the basketball team's parents
on Saturday night and talk,)

147
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,310
(can you come?)

148
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,170
(Beef entrails, pork galbi, pork belly)

149
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,380
(I can go, but will everyone come?)

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,980
(Don't worry.)

151
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,850
(There's a way for everything.)

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,590
What are you guys doing with my phone?

153
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,290
Accomplice. You have to include
the world "accomplice".

154
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,330
Next, "lawsuit".

155
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,130
"File a lawsuit".

156
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,570
I sent it.

157
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,010
(I'm Go Deok-jin, father of Go Woo-young,
a member of the basketball team.)

158
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,210
(I want to hold an emergency parent meeting...)

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,580
(regarding Coach Choi Il-kwon's corruption.)

160
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,010
(For your information,
if you choose not to attend this meeting,)

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,880
(I'll regard you as Coach Choi Il-kwon's accomplice)

162
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,120
(and file a lawsuit against you with my personal lawyer.)

163
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,520
(Then I will see you all
on Saturday night at 8 p.m. in the gymnasium.)

164
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,370
- I know.
- Seriously.

165
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,100
(- I won't go. I refuse to go!)
- What's going on?

166
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,300
Why should I go to the parent meeting?

167
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,370
I'm asking you for this favor.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
In return, I'll clean the house,
do the laundry,

169
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,010
cook, and wash the dishes.

170
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Those are all things that
you're supposed to do anyway.

171
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,310
Right. Of course I should do that.

172
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,650
Is he really a parent?

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,950
Is his son a maid?

174
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,620
Then I'll give you more money
for my living expenses.

175
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,650
Hey.

176
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,820
Has he been giving you money too?

177
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,960
Of course.

178
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,360
Should I let him live with me for free?
Am I a philanthropist?

179
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,430
My gosh.

180
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,430
He takes money from a high school student.

181
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,160
Regardless, I can't help you.

182
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,330
Hey!

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,440
She's helping me, so why won't you?

184
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,970
Honestly, she has no reason to help me.

185
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,140
But you have to help me.

186
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,310
Why should I?

187
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,680
You're my dad! Darn it!

188
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,980
You punk. You only call me Dad
when you need something.

189
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,220
Do you see me as a pushover, you jerk?

190
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,880
I asked to act like my dad,
so why are you cursing at me?

191
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,920
That's what I'm saying. Why must I
act like your dad, you punk.

192
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,820
Darn it. Have you ever acted
like a proper dad to me?

193
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,960
I pay for living expenses.

194
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,290
Really, you jerk?
Pay for the water bill then, you punk.

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,830
Pay for my property tax too, you jerk.

196
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,430
Gosh, darn it.
I don't have money for that.

197
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Do you even know when to pay property tax?

198
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,200
- What?
- It's around this time.

199
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,940
Then put it under my name,
I'll pay for it then.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,770
Both of them aren't normal.

201
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,910
(- Are you serious, you jerk?)
- That woman is strange too.

202
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,440
- Let's go. Hurry.
- Goodness.

203
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,480
I refuse to go.

204
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,750
My gosh. I'm so busy,
why did he call us here?

205
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,720
- What does he want?
- I don't have time for this.

206
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,350
- My gosh.
- Why would he ask us to come?

207
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,390
What a waste of time.

208
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,890
What is this?

209
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,830
What kind of punk is he?

210
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,000
- Why did he call us here?
- Why would he ask us to come?

211
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,400
Thank you for taking time from your busy
schedules to come here.

212
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,500
I refuse to go!

213
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,570
I'm going to call Ms. Ok
to the meeting too.

214
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,540
- Ms. Ok?
- Yes.

215
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,840
She thinks a lot about the students.

216
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,880
But imagine what would happen
if you lead the parents

217
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,080
to resolve this issue.

218
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,850
She wouldn't be able to help
but fall in love.

219
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,050
Really?

220
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,930
Thank you for coming.

221
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,860
Of course I should be here.

222
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,970
The reason I gathered all of you here

223
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,570
is so that we can get rid of
Coach Choi Il-kwon.

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,470
- That's enough.
- My gosh.

225
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,040
18 years ago, I was also a known member

226
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,080
of Serim High School's basketball team.

227
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,210
My son learned how to play basketball
from me, so he's a great player.

228
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,020
Really?

229
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,450
Yes.

230
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,460
To be honest, there was a coach

231
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,430
who asked for money 18 years ago too.

232
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,570
However, my parents didn't give him money.

233
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,100
Why?

234
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,170
Because they believed in me.

235
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,940
That's the reason why I can stand here
without shame

236
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,710
in front of all of you today.

237
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,780
Excuse me.

238
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,080
What does that have to do
with Coach Choi Il-kwon?

239
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,680
My fellow alumnus, Choi Il-kwon,
wasn't always such a bad guy.

240
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,850
But

241
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,290
do you know when he started
acting this way?

242
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,920
(Choi Il-kwon)

243
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,830
Did you get it ready?

244
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,890
(Serim High School)

245
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,330
There won't be a problem with the starting lineup, right?

246
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,500
Of course not.

247
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,210
(Choi Il-kwon)

248
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
Go Deok-jin, listen carefully.

249
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,820
If you tell anyone about what you saw,
I won't leave you alone.

250
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,690
Okay. I won't tell anyone that your dad
gave the coach money.

251
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
Shut your mouth!

252
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,600
(After that day, Choi Il-kwon)

253
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,230
took money from me,

254
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,470
and he started hitting me.

255
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,200
I thought he came to his senses
when he became a teacher,

256
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,270
but he's still taking money from people.

257
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,310
Just like what that coach did 18 years ago

258
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,340
to Choi Il-kwon's father.

259
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,610
But he's doing that to us.

260
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,010
Are we going to raise

261
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,220
our children to become a bad adult like
Choi Il-kwon?

262
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,420
- Really?
- Gosh, he's a really bad guy.

263
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,460
- This seems true.
- He has a point.

264
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,260
I'm against it.

265
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,230
If we testify,

266
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,260
we're all going to be punished.

267
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
That's right.

268
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,170
It'll forever haunt our kids as well.

269
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,200
Why should we ruin our children's future?

270
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,070
- He's right.
- We can't do that.

271
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,710
- We can't do that.
- Absolutely not.

272
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,240
I can't do that to my kid.

273
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,640
That's terrible.

274
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,390
Can any of you stand tall in front of your kids?

275
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
Has anyone

276
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,490
told their kid that they've been paying the coach

277
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,060
so that they can go to college?

278
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,370
We may not be

279
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,110
parents who make their kids proud,

280
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,070
but that doesn't mean we should be
such shameful parents.

281
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm

282
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,180
so embarrassed of you.

283
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,150
Basketball is a dream to all of our kids.

284
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,790
If they found out that their dreams
came true by going against the law,

285
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,060
how do you think they'd feel?

286
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,900
More than being disappointed
in their parents,

287
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,500
they're more likely to place blame
on themselves.

288
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,900
They may blame themselves

289
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,440
for being not good enough

290
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,470
that their parents had to commit a crime.

291
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,180
But we have an important game coming up!

292
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
We can't let this issue get big.

293
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,980
You're right. If the Ministry of Education starts
looking into this,

294
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,920
it's going to take a long time.

295
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,250
Are you giving up on the games?

296
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
You can't do that!

297
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,850
- We can't do that.
- Absolutely not.

298
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,990
Exactly.

299
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,190
Come on.

300
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,460
What about this?

301
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,390
According to my research,

302
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,100
Mr. Choi runs a bar.

303
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,930
- What?
- Is he insane?

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,270
- My goodness.
- Unbelievable.

305
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,670
I'll report him
to a current affairs program.

306
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,170
If this snowballs,

307
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,770
they might expedite the investigation.

308
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,460
Thanks for the documents.

309
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,889
Mr. Nam, please have a look at this.

310
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,690
(Financial Transaction Records)

311
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,730
(Recipient: Choi Il-kwon)

312
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,000
Is this true?

313
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,300
Do you think this can be evidence?

314
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,240
This is enough for us
to start investigating right away.

315
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,210
Who are you? Please leave.

316
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm Anchor Nam Gi-tae of "On the Site, 25 Hours".

317
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,320
You're Coach Jung, right?

318
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,720
Yes. What brings you here?

319
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,320
There was a report that you've been taking

320
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,990
bribes to admit students to Hankuk University.

321
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,260
Could we interview you?

322
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,390
I've never done such a thing.

323
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,500
Sir, you know this is
very important, right?

324
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,830
I've never done such a thing!
What are you talking about?

325
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,230
Turn the camera off and leave.

326
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,740
Please calm down.

327
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,670
I'm almost there.

328
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,380
Why did the police come?

329
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,810
(I have no idea.)

330
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,450
(Just get here quickly!)

331
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,650
All right. See you soon. Bye.

332
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,760
(- You!)
- Yes?

333
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,720
What have you been doing?

334
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,130
What's wrong?

335
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,590
JBC came to my school to investigate

336
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,100
on corrupt admissions.

337
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,800
What? JBC?

338
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,480
Da-jung, as you said, this bar belongs
to Choi Il-kwon.

339
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,080
The part-timer here confirmed it.

340
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,020
Darn it, Jung Da-jung!

341
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,320
That woman!

342
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,160
(Meet me at the gym.)

343
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,060
(I'm giving you your last chance.)

344
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,230
Last chance? All right.

345
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,230
That's what I'm giving you.

346
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,660
How dare...

347
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm not recording you.

348
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,690
All right. Let's hear it.

349
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,920
What last chance are you giving me?

350
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,260
Your part-timer

351
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,390
has testified for us.

352
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,590
You're going to get a search and seizure
of your bar

353
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,360
for illegal operation of it.

354
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,430
That will then expose you

355
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,830
of taking bribes from parents

356
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,070
and paying the college coaches.

357
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,840
Turn yourself in before it's too late.

358
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,440
You're really trying hard.

359
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,050
But you know,

360
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,080
the bar is owned by my brother.

361
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,050
Even if you report me, you can't get me.

362
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
That's too bad.

363
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,090
It'll be possible

364
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,990
if the parents testify.

365
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,730
Are you serious?

366
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,830
I'm letting their untalented kids
play basketball.

367
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,500
Who'd turn their backs
on such a great teacher?

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,670
You call yourself a teacher
when you take bribes

369
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,510
to have kids play at games
and go to college?

370
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,940
When did I ever promise that?

371
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,680
- What?
- They don't believe in their kids,

372
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,650
so they just keep coming to me.

373
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,710
That's why I took some money

374
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,680
and consoled them,
saying their kids can go to college.

375
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,050
They were probably happy

376
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,590
just imagining their kids in college.

377
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,020
They got their money's worth, then, no?

378
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,490
How can someone like you be a teacher?

379
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,430
How dare you try to teach a teacher?

380
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,460
I'm telling you.

381
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,100
I'm not going to go down alone.

382
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,930
If something bad happens to me,

383
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm going to say that I got money
from you as well.

384
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,610
You think you'll be able to
keep your job as an anchorwoman?

385
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,870
I have

386
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,580
never paid you anything.

387
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,850
Is that right? Let's see.

388
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,920
Maybe I can say that I got something else.

389
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,350
Choi Il-kwon.

390
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,960
You missed your last chance.

391
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,160
You're so annoying.

392
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,630
Who are you to give me a chance?

393
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,520
Who's that?

394
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,390
Seriously?

395
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,090
Why are you here?

396
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,230
To send a corrupt teacher to jail.

397
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,530
Maybe I didn't beat you up enough
when you were young.

398
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
How haven't you changed
in all these years?

399
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,230
Il-kwon, when are you going to grow up?

400
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,740
What are you doing?

401
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,140
You!

402
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,110
Stop it!

403
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,180
Look at that.

404
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,290
Hey.

405
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,030
Your arm is going to break.
Get it out of my way.

406
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,000
Who do you think you are?

407
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,700
You are nothing.

408
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,530
Stop it!

409
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,010
How long have you been there for?

410
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm going to be

411
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,180
testifying.

412
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,750
What you've heard up to now is

413
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,650
all a misunderstanding.

414
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,260
These two keep messing
with the basketball team,

415
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,690
so I just made things up to scare them.

416
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,660
Right. You know that I've talked Ja-sung
into Hankuk University, right?

417
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,230
You need to get Ja-sung
into Hankuk University.

418
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,400
University?
You don't even deserve to be a teacher.

419
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
What did you just say?

420
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,470
I guess

421
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,580
I'll just let Ki-woong take
Ja-sung's spot.

422
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm also going to testify!

423
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,720
What?

424
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,850
I'm joining in!

425
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,250
- Me too.
- Myself as well!

426
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,820
- I'm going to testify.
- Me too.

427
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,050
Me too.

428
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,700
My gosh. Why are you all here?

429
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,070
I'll report him
to a current affairs program.

430
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,710
If this snowballs,

431
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,180
they might expedite the investigation.

432
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,110
But do you think reporting him
to a TV station will

433
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,580
solve this problem?

434
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,180
We can solve it

435
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,520
as long as

436
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,980
everyone

437
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,590
testifies.

438
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,960
But I'm not sure

439
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,860
with whom I should side with.

440
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,590
To be frank, I can't believe
everything you say either.

441
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,730
Then,

442
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,400
I'll show you what kind of man

443
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,970
Choi Il-kwon is.

444
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,650
Please hear me out.
I can explain everything.

445
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,380
I have kept all the receipts
of the drinks I paid for you.

446
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,050
No. You just wanted
to buy those drinks for us.

447
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,250
Well,

448
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,660
Ja-sung's spot at Hankuk University

449
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,920
will be Gi-yong's now.

450
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,760
You'd better think carefully about it.

451
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,660
He won't go!

452
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,730
I'm going to make sure

453
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,670
to lock you up with those coaches
from Hankuk University.

454
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,640
Darn it!

455
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,610
Do you think people will believe you?

456
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,670
I'm going to

457
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,910
sue all of you for defamation.

458
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,210
And

459
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,580
your sons won't be able to play
basketball for the rest of their lives.

460
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,080
- A lunatic.
- What a jerk!

461
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,690
- How could he say that?
- He's unbelievable.

462
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,950
What? "Lunatic"?

463
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,460
Hey.

464
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,760
I really want to punch you right now,
but I'm trying very hard not to.

465
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,860
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

466
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,670
I'm sure you know it's over for you.

467
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,970
Come to your senses
and admit to your crimes.

468
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,500
Admit to my crimes?

469
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
How dare you treat me, a teacher,
like some kind of criminal?

470
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,180
- Gosh.
- What?

471
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,050
Hey! Gosh.

472
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,320
Hey. Goodness.

473
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,890
Gosh.

474
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,700
An assault has been reported.

475
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,630
Yes.

476
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,670
Who's the assailant?

477
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,300
It's him.

478
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,770
Hey, Chu Ae-rin!

479
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,310
Goodness. Can't you see this? You...

480
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,840
This is self-defense.

481
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,680
That jerk beat me up,
so she was just helping me.

482
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,280
Everyone in here witnessed it.

483
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,880
- I saw it.
- I did.

484
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,450
- I saw it too.
- I saw it.

485
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,620
- I saw it.
- I saw everything.

486
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,390
Goodness. Darn it.

487
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,190
Hey. What?

488
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,990
Hey, why are you taking me?

489
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,730
What did I do wrong?

490
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,930
Let's talk at the station.

491
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,200
Officer, I didn't do anything wrong!

492
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,670
Let go of me!

493
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,700
Let me go! Hey!

494
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,670
Darn it. Let go of me.

495
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,080
(Go Deok-jin)

496
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,050
Be careful.

497
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,450
Sorry.

498
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
(Choi Il-kwon)

499
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,020
Choi Il-kwon.

500
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,830
If you like playing dodgeball more,
you should make a transition now.

501
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,030
Don't take up a spot in the lineup.

502
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,330
You're robbing players who are
better than you of their chances.

503
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,340
Sir, five million won will suffice.

504
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,440
No.

505
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,280
Isn't that Hong Dae-young's father?

506
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,880
Gosh, Dae-young. He got his spot
because his father paid the coach too.

507
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,620
How dare he say that to me?

508
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,690
Sir!

509
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,520
I cannot do that.

510
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,660
Sir, when you're raising
a basketball player,

511
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,860
five million won is nothing.

512
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,330
How can a teacher

513
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,400
demand a parent for a bribe
and call it nothing?

514
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,930
I made myself very clear.

515
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,630
If you discriminate my son

516
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,400
because I didn't pay you,
I'll tell the school right away.

517
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,140
Do you understand?

518
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,510
Goodness.

519
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,780
(Serim High School)

520
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,900
("On the Site, 25 Hours")

521
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,400
(I'm inside a bar
which was illegally operated)

522
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,500
(by a high school teacher, Choi.)

523
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,840
(Choi violated)

524
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,370
(the Public Officials Act and encouraged
bribes for college admission.)

525
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,840
(He demanded money from the parents
for a spot in the lineup)

526
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,080
(and forced them to pay
for his entertainment expenses.)

527
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,980
What's more shocking is

528
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,320
that he assaulted a parent.

529
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,750
(That jerk...)

530
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,020
(Assaulted parent)
(I mean I heard that she was watching.)

531
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,890
(Gosh, had he not lied...)

532
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,490
(As you can see, the assaulted parent)

533
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,860
(made no sense with his statement
and seemed very shocked.)

534
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,960
Who is that?

535
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,300
(- Is it swollen?)
- I don't know. Who is it?

536
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,000
Gosh, what on earth is happening?

537
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,170
(Choi, the high school coach,)

538

Jung and Lim,)

539
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,480
(were sentenced to serve time in prison
for taking bribes)

540
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,780
(and will be detained.)

541
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,410
(The Basketball Association announced
of using this incident to launch)

542
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,920
(an investigation at every high school)

543
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,120
(in Korea to make sure there is
no foul play for college admission.)

544
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,550
As 13 parents complied and paid the bribe,

545
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,690
due to their wrong decision,
they were put on probation.

546
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,190
(File a report to for college admission corruption.)
But I would like to sincerely offer my gratitude

547
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,660
for courageously telling the truth.

548
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,470
(I'm Nam Gi-tae of "On the Site, 25 Hours".)

549
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,520
I knew

550
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,420
you would cause trouble one day.

551
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,490
You always disappointed me.

552
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,690
And you still do.

553
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,000
Have you

554
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,870
ever believed in me?

555
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,040
What?

556
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,440
Have you ever

557
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,740
sided with me?

558
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,350
If you have ever made me proud,

559
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,920
I would have!

560
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,460
Do you know how much money
I invested in you?

561
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,190
But you ended up
as a lowly high school coach?

562
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,760
You're pathetic.

563
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,270
Gosh. You're pathetic.

564
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,640
Do you know how much money
I invested in you?

565
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,710
I wanted you

566
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,780
- to succeed.
- But I didn't!

567
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,550
Okay?

568
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,020
I didn't succeed.
Why do you think I'm here?

569
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,150
How

570
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,390
do you think I ended up here?

571
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,930
You're a failure.

572
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,800
(Keep silence)

573
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,210
Due to the distasteful incident,

574
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,080
we have caused a lot of pain

575
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,350
on both the students and the parents.

576
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,420
As the principal, I would like to deeply
apologize for the wrongdoing.

577
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,220
I promise to do my best

578
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,890
to bring a healthy change
to our basketball team from now on.

579
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,230
On that note,
I'd like to introduce a new coach

580
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,630
and a parent representative
who will help bring that change.

581
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,140
This is the statement from the parents.

582
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,080
It's basically saying they won't give
you any money even if you ask.

583
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,880
Okay. Please don't worry.

584
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,380
- Okay. I look forward to working with you.
- I'll do my best.

585
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,850
That's all.

586
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,750
Thank you.

587
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,350
Are you all right?

588
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,660
You were interrogated by the police.
So the people at the company...

589
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,360
My company is strong.
It won't crumble because of that.

590
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,230
Don't worry about me.

591
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,270
Now, you have to do this on your own.

592
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,500
Okay.

593
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Mom.

594
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,950
Thank you.

595
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,820
- I hope we can work well together.
- Okay. Bye.

Bye.

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,490
I'm not even his real parent.
Why am I the representative?

598
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,800
Darn it.

Mr. Go.

600
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,370
Ms. Ok. When did you get here?

601
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,540
From the beginning.

602
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,670
You were very cool today.

603
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,040
"Cool"?

604
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,110
I know that you worked very hard
to solve this problem.

605
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,610
It's late,

606
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,820
but I still wanted to thank you.

607
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,550
And thank you for today as well.

608
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,690
See you around.

609
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,190
She'll see me around?

610
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,400
Ms. Ok.

611
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,460
Would you like to have coffee next time?

612
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,690
Okay.

613
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Hong Si-woo.

614
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,420
I want to apologize for everything

615
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,180
that I did to you.

616
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,420
The fact that you saw me get hit by my dad

617
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,060
hurt my pride.

618
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,130
It wasn't your fault,

619
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,930
but I

620
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,340
let my anger out on you.

621
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,170
I'm really sorry.

622
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,350
Wait.

623
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,520
- Jin-cheol?
- Da-jung.

(Seongjong Electronics Service Center)

625
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,090
Have you been well?

626
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,900
Is Young-jun growing up well?

627
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,130
Yes, of course he is.

628
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,840
You used to send us gifts through Dae-young.

629
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,340
We received so much from you,

630
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,040
but we didn't do anything in return.

631
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,740
No, it's fine.

632
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,150
I wonder if Dae-young is doing well.

633
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,250
He must be so upset after getting fired
from the company.

634
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,250
Pardon?

635
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,920
He was fired from the company?

636
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,060
You didn't know?

637
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,260
Dae-young didn't get the promotion
that he was waiting for,

638
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,900
and he got transferred to Busan.

639
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,400
He went to the head of the center
to complain about it...

640
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm only holding back

641
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,600
for my family.

642
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,180
Family?

643
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,450
How pathetic for a woman and a child

644
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,650
to depend on a man like that?

645
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,520
They're obviously failures in life.

646
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,290
You!

647
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,960
I am quitting today!

648
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,030
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

649
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,060
What kind of man

650
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,970
can stay quiet when someone
curses their family?

651
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,300
He hit the head of the center,
and as of that day,

652
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,800
he was fired from the company.

653
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,920
Here. Eat up.

654
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,890
Since when did you like things like this?

655
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,700
You liked toast.

656
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,470
You remember.

657
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,630
But as I got older,

658
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,040
my palate changed.

659
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Really?

660
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,940
What do you like now?

661
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,870
I still like toast,

662
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,740
but I enjoy sundaeguk too.

663
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,010
Just like you.

664
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,580
I guess you're old now.

665
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,630
Of course.

666
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,530
But today, I feel like I'm young again.

667
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,170
I got to come here and have this with you.

668
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,900
Si-a likes this, so I had it often.

669
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,770
Okay. Let's eat.

670
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Okay.

671
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,750
Gosh. This is dry cleaning only.

672
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,990
It's like I'm raising two kids.

673
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,060
Come here.

674
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,830
Your mom used to say that all the time.

675
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,630
Mom too?

676
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,040
Da-jung used to nag and say
she was raising three kids.

677
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,340
When I think about Da-jung,

678
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,040
I still feel sorry for her.

679
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,140
She was so young,

680
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,110
but she was busy raising the kids
and working.

681
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,450
I'm sure it was a lot to handle,

682
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,610
but up until now,

683
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,280
Da-jung took care of me often.

684
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,190
Father. Does it taste okay?

685
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,430
Why did you make so much?

686
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,900
I put in plenty of side dishes
in the fridge,

687
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,630
so don't skip any meals.

688
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,570
As for the beef bone broth,
heat it up in the pan

689
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,110
and add some scallions on top.

690
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,710
All right.

691
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,980
Father. Don't forget to check
your blood pressure every day.

692
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,810
- Okay.
- Also,

693
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,550
I wrote the instructions
in bigger handwriting for you.

694
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,990
(How to use the blood pressure machine)

695
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,590
I set the temperature, so it's warm.

696
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,700
You'll be comfortable when you sleep now.

697
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,960
Why did you buy this for me?

698
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,130
Goodness.

699
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,340
Da-jung took really good care of me.

700
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,740
She

701
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,710
went through a lot because of me.

702
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,140
How is work these days?

703
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,280
It's good.

704
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,920
Take care of your health as you work.

705
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,290
Thank you for worrying about me.

706
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,390
You should take care of your health
as you practice.

707
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Okay.

708
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,130
Mom.

709
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,500
Oh, Si-a.

710
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,730
Are you just getting home?

711
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,100
Yes. What about you?

712
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm going to meet Si-woo.

713
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,310
Gosh, I don't want to go to school.

714
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,570
What is it this time?

715
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,840
It's the festival.

716
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,880
It's so loud, and it's just a formality.

717
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,450
Why? When you look back,
it will be a good memory.

718
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,320
He's right. When you look back,
it will be a good memory.

719
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,320
Did you have a good memory
of the festival?

720
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
A good memory?

721
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,110
What kind of memory was it?

722
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,170
What?

723
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,840
You know.

724
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,850
It was loud and just a formality.

725
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,790
Now that I think about it,
festivals aren't that great.

726
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,360
Gosh. I knew it.

727
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,730
- You know the festival is coming up?
- Yes.

728
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,470
Take a look at what's written

729
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,400
and raise your hand for the thing you want to do.

730
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,300
Who wants to help prepare for the photo exhibit?

731
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,410
Three people?

732
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,710
The basketball team
cleaned up the entire gym yesterday.

733
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,610
Cleaning the gym is the easiest.

734
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,280
Forget it. Stop.

735
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,050
Me too!

736
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay, then Woo-young can also join
in preparing for the photo exhibit.

737
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,660
Then grab the photo albums
and move to the music room.

738
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

739
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,030
I...

740
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,070
Next up. Who wants to help set up the outdoor stage?

741
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,700
Anyone else?

742
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,500
- Gosh.
- The remaining kids will clean.

743
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,940
Done.

744
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,480
(Past Festival Material)

745
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,310
(The festival)

746
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,300
Are you okay?

747
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,700
Gosh. I'm okay.

748
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,700
You're not okay.

749
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,770
Goodness. That's going to bruise.

750
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
Let's take a look.

751
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,750
Don't touch her.

752
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,650
Why? Am I not allowed to touch her?

753
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,120
No, you're not.

754
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,390
Why not?

755
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,660
Because

756
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,910
you have dust on your hands.

757
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,570
What? Dust?

758
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,810
Gosh. I have dust on my hands.
What is this?

759
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,810
Gosh, you touched me with those hands.

760
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,410
Gosh.

761
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,950
Goodness.

762
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,450
Hey, Bo-bae.
Let's go get the photo albums.

763
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,120
- Okay.
- Gosh.

764
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,090
Are you okay?

765
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,990
Seo Ji-ho.

766
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,270
What?

767
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,740
Do you have

768
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,780
a crush on Si-a?

769
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,010
That's none of your business.

770
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,890
Look at that.

771
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,990
He must be serious.

772
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,260
Goodness.

773
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,290
He was such a baby,
but now he even gets jealous.

774
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,230
How adorable.

775
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,300
But you can't have Si-a.

776
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,440
No man can take Si-a!

777
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,600
Absolutely not.

778
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,970
No, nobody.

779
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,880
What are you doing here alone?

780
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,240
Why are you here?

781
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,620
This would've been my zone
if it weren't for someone.

782
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:26,650
Do you

783
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,150
like Si-a?

784
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,320
Of course.

785
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,730
As a woman?

786
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,060
Are you insane?

787
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,800
That's disgusting!

788
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,800
- No?
- Absolutely not!

789
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,230
How does that make sense in your head?

790
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,540
- It does.
- What?

791
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,440
I like Si-a as a woman.

792
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,480
So, whatever happens,

793
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,580
don't dare to interrupt.

794
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,480
Si-a is mine.

795
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:07,490
- What did you just say?
- Are you deaf?

796
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,860
Si-a is mine.

797
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,000
"Mine"?

798
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,040
I...

799
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,470
I'm sorry.

800
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:25,380
Sir, who are you?

801
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,450
What? Sir?

802
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,190
What's with that reaction?

803
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,830
Don't act like you know this
in front of the other kids.

804
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,460
Just stay quiet.

805
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,780
(I can never stay quiet!)

806
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,510
(I'll protect my daughter.)

807
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,280
Goodnight.

808
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,890
Do you have something to say?

809
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,360
- Yes.
- What is it?

810
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,230
I actually...

811
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,040
Hello.

812
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,910
What?

813
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,880
- Why are you here?
- Why would I be at a convenience store?

814
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,490
I hear that the basketball team has
a new coach.

815
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,790
How is he?

816
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,530
He's good.

817
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,400
Did you just worry about me?

818
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,870
Worry? No. I'm just curious.

819
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:04,910
Here.

820
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,650
You can drink this one.

821
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,150
Why are you giving this to me?

822
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,680
It's buy 1 get 1 free.

823
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,120
I just want one,
and I can't throw the other away.

824
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,060
Seo Ji-ho!

825
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,700
What? I thought you were
getting rid of it.

826
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,110
Why are you two here?

827
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,660
Aren't you two going to go home?

828
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,660
You're not going, either.

829
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,360
I'm waiting to walk Si-a home.

830
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,430
Why would you do that?

831
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,870
"Why"?

832
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,400
Because it's a scary world out there.

833
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,600
(- I'm leaving now!
- Good work. Get home safely.)

834
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,770
(Thank you. Goodnight.)

835
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,980
- Si-a, let's go.
- Sure.

836
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,380
Why are you all still here?

837
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,620
Your father asked me to do something.

838
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,590
What did he ask you to do?

839
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,190
I'll tell you as we walk.

840
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,090
Get home safely, you two.

841
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,060
Let's go.

842
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,730
What are you doing? Come on.

843
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,500
All right.

844
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,940
Bye.

845
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,640
- That punk!
- That punk!

846
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:47,750
Come on.

847
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,050
What do you

848
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,350
think of those two?

849
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,120
Those two?

850
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,260
Seo Ji-ho and Gu Ja-sung.

851
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,860
Not as friends, but as men.

852
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,000
Are you insane?

853
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,230
I've been friends with Ji-ho for ten years!

854
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,030
How can I see him as a man?

855
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,240
And I get furious

856
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,910
just thinking about
how Ja-sung bullied Si-woo.

857
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,840
Goodness, he's annoying.

858
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,250
Wait.

859
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,080
Why are you going the dark way?

860
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,890
This is the faster way.

861
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,690
There's not a lot of people around,
and it's dark.

862
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,490
There are no surveillance cameras, either.

863
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,130
Go through a brighter area.

864
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,160
It's already dangerous for you
to be out so late.

865
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,170
Stop nagging.

866
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,370
- Am I a kid?
- Yes, you are.

867
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,570
And

868
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,670
take this around with you.

869
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,540
It's an alarm in case of danger.

870
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,440
You can use it.

871
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,110
Your father asked me to give it to you.
Take it.

872
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,850
Goodness.

873
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,390
Si-a!

874
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,230
Mom!

875
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,830
You two are coming together?

876
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,970
No, he just walked me home.

877
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,910
You're coming home quite late.

878
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,040
Yes, work ended late.

879
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,610
It's late. You should get home quickly.

880
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Yes, ma'am.

881
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,650
- Get home safely.
- All right.

882
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,920
Let's go.

883
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,550
Bye.

884
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,120
Did I interrupt you two?

885
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,230
What are you talking about?

886
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,390
He and I are nothing like that.

887
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,800
It's more suspicious
that you're getting so mad.

888
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,230
I'm telling you!

889
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,440
Gosh, I mean it!

890
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,670
(Observation report 25)

891
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,340
(10:10 p.m.)

892
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,940
(Met up with his family.)

893
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,480
(10:30 p.m.)

894
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,710
(Hasn't left the house since coming back.)

895
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,720
(Observation complete.)

896
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,820
(Carrying out)

897
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,390
(the plan tomorrow.)

898
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,120
(Content)

899
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,800
Hey, can we talk for a moment?

900
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,080
What's wrong?

901
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,780
Don't be too shocked.

902
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,650
I heard from Producer Park,

903
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,760
but apparently, only three of us will be
signing full contracts.

904
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,390
What about the other one?

905
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,690
They're going to get fired.

906
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,430
You all didn't know about this, right?

907
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:28,770
I had no idea.

908
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,900
Same here.

909
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,370
Me neither.

910
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,970
Shouldn't we do something about it?

911
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,540
Let's check with HR first.

912
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,250
And if it is true, why don't we tell them

913
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,750
as a group that
the decision they made isn't fair?

914
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,520
The company already made a decision.

915
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,020
Do you think by taking action,
we'll be able to change anything?

916
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,560
Then, do you just want to sit back
and do nothing?

917
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,290
This is the reality we are in.

918
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,330
We must do our best to survive here.

919
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,940
Ms. Kwon, if we don't have
a united front, this is useless.

920
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,310
I think you're letting your emotions
make decisions for you right now.

921
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,240
Why don't you be rational?

922
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,340
And if you want to bring this up,
count me out.

923
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,080
Then, I'll get going.

924
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,050
(Conference Room)

925
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,520
Oh, my. She's so cold.

926
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,920
So she sees us as competition, right?

927
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,560
What programs are you on?
I have a current affairs program.

928
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,560
Ja-young is on a culture program
and a radio show.

929
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,100
That... Yu-mi has

930
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,070
variety shows and baseball interviews.
And you, Da-jung...

931
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,240
Only I don't have a fixed program.

932
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,440
I'm sure you'll get offers
to be on another show soon.

933
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,080
Right.

934
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,750
Don't worry.

935
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,960
Hello.

936
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,460
You're Ms. Jung Da-jung, right?

937
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,960
I'm Park Gi-seong,
a variety show producer.

938
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,830
This is Lee Bo-ra, a variety show writer.

939
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,170
Hello.

940
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,000
- The producer came in person.
- Right.

941
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,810
It's a pilot program for the holiday.

942
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,240
And we really want to hire you as the MC.

943
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,610
If this does well,
this might become a regular show.

944
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,580
MC?

945
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,380
Awesome!

946
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,150
But why are you offering me that job?

947
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,520
(Program Proposal for "Couples in Crises")

948
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,390
This show is about divorce.

949
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,760
We really want you to host the show.

950
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,390
I see.

951
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,600
This is the data we have
from last year's events.

952
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,610
There are some overlapping parts
with this year.

953
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,740
I have someone bringing me
this year's version from my house.

954
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,780
I hope you're not trying
to stall time like last time.

955
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,750
To wait for your son who's my fan.

956
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,580
He's not your fan anymore.

957
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,890
Actually, he hates you now.

958
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,850
That's odd.

959
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,120
I'm performing better these days.

960
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,190
I guess he's even more jealous
because you're performing better now.

961
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,700
As a matter of fact, you're better
than him in so many ways.

962
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,470
Pardon? What do you mean?

963
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,070
Am I your errand boy now?

964
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,370
Wait.

965
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,150
You were his son?

966
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,610
Hey, nice to see you.

967
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,180
You needed this, right?

968
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,850
Right. That's the one.
Wait for me outside.

969
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,760
He must really hate me.

970
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,030
I told you so.

971
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,930
Anyway, you have the new files.

972
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,840
Let's go over them
and talk business first.

973
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,270
Sure.

974
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:25,270
They've gone mad. They want you
to host a show about divorce?

975
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,510
If I don't take this show,

976
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,040
I might get fired.

977
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,280
What?

978
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,780
Why?

979
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,480
They'll only hire three people
after the probationary period.

980
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,250
And I'm the only one without a show.

981
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:44,250
Ae-rin, if I do take this show,

982
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,560
can you help me?

983
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,290
I'm livid,

984
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,490
so let's eat something spicy
that burns our stomachs.

985
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,260
No. I don't have an appetite.

986
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,170
Don't be like that. Come with me.

987
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:58,940
You always ate spicy food
when you were stressed out.

988
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Next time.

989
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,610
I can tell from your face that
you haven't eaten a single meal today.

990
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,120
Ms. Jung.

991
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,560
What? Mr. Ye.

992
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,260
Gosh, this area must have good chill.

993
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,060
I run into you whenever I'm here.

994
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,330
Well, are you here because of work?

995
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,840
Yes. I am. Because of you.

996
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,270
- Pardon?
- I came here because of you,

997
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,010
so I can see you.

998
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,140
I mean it.

999
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:42,310
Look.

1000
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,720
- What?
- I was leaving after a business meeting.

1001
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,150
And I saw you walking
on the street, passing by.

1002
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,560
If you haven't had dinner,
can you join me?

1003
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,300
Well, I had a late lunch.

1004
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,000
Then, can you sit in front of me?

1005
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,870
I can't eat at restaurants by myself.

1006
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,040
Gosh. I'm starving. Goodness.

1007
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,740
I'm out of energy too.

1008
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:19,620
The chef here serves amazing food.

1009
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,520
Her spicy stir-fried pork is to die for.

1010
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,460
- Ma'am.
- Look at you, Ji-hoon.

1011
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,790
Where have you been all this time?
You're making me sad.

1012
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,400
I'm sorry. It's the baseball season.
I've been busy.

1013
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,500
What?

1014
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,040
Aren't you Ms. Jung Da-jung?

1015
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,570
Do you know me?

1016
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,940
Of course! I'm a huge fan of yours.

1017
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,180
By the way,
what's going on between you two?

1018
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,220
You've never brought a lady here.

1019
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,750
She's a close colleague.

1020
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,650
Don't get the wrong idea.
Spicy pork, please.

1021
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,320
Sure.

1022
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:00,490
Oh, right. Ma'am,
put a lot of chili pepper powder!

1023
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,160
Make it spicy that it burns our stomachs!

1024
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,430
A lot of chili pepper powder?

1025
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,530
He can't even handle spicy food.

1026
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,670
Whatever.

1027
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:13,970
All right. Let's do this, then.

1028
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,160
My gosh, it's so good.

1029
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,260
My stress is gone now!

1030
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,930
Oh, right.

1031
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,560
You should try it.

1032
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,900
No. I'm good.

1033
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,500
It's really good.
Just have one bite. Please?

1034
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,870
All right, then.

1035
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,150
My gosh, it's so good.

1036
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,280
Right? Eat with me.

1037
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,520
Ma'am, one more bowl of rice!

1038
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,400
Ms. Jung!

1039
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,270
Can you give me an autograph?

1040
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,740
An autograph?

1041
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:27,380
A celebrity came to my restaurant.
I should hang it up.

1042
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:29,310
(Ma'am!)

1043
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:31,620
I'm coming!

1044
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,850
Can you sign it and put it on the counter?

1045
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,520
You look much prettier in person.

1046
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:43,760
This feels weird.

1047
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,830
I've only signed contracts up until now.

1048
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,200
Hold on.

1049
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:52,400
Don't sign it yet.

1050
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,780
Here.
This is the glove I wear for my games.

1051
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,050
- And?
- Sign my glove first.

1052
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,320
I'm your number one fan, remember?

1053
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:16,990
- What?
- Come on. Please.

1054
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,930
This is really important to me.

1055
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,670
Okay.

1056
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,710
Thank you.

1057
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,360
Gosh, it burns. It's killing me.

1058
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,410
(I'll always root for you.
From Jung Da-jung.)

1059
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,620
- She lost all of her shows?
- Yes.

1060
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:16,420
But she got an offer to host
a show about divorce.

1061
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,420
What does she want to do?

1062
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,690
She thinks it's her last chance.

1063
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,000
Then, she should take it.

1064
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,630
What?

1065
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:32,440
If the show airs, people will talk.

1066
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,470
We don't even know how people will react.

1067
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,410
This might take a toll on Da-jung
and your kids.

1068
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,140
I'm sure she's aware of it.

1069
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,080
But if she thinks this is her last chance

1070
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:46,780
and if she must do it,

1071
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,990
I don't think

1072
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,930
she's making this decision
just for herself.

1073
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,010
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

1074
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,420
- This is beautiful.
- Awesome.

1075
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,190
It's so pretty.

1076
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,190
Gosh.

1077
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,960
- This is amazing.
- Kids grow up so fast.

1078
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,860
I want them to slow down a bit.

1079
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,030
Right. It's sad to see them
grow up so quickly.

1080
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,800
Once they all grow up, they won't
join us for the fireworks, right?

1081
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:37,400
That's all right. We have each other.

1082
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,670
Dae-young.

1083
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:43,410
Actually,

1084
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,480
I got the result from the interview
for the anchorwoman position.

1085
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,410
Really? Did you get it?

1086
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,620
I didn't get it.

1087
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,790
Why would you say that with a smile on?

1088
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:57,520
I was happy.

1089
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,790
When I went for the interview,

1090
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:03,090
the fact that I was at a TV station

1091
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,060
made me so happy.

1092
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,970
So I'm going to give it my all.

1093
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,040
I want to show our kids how I'll keep

1094
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,840
trying and challenging myself.

1095
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,910
And I'll make my dream come true

1096
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,510
and make them proud as a cool mother.

1097
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,680
Yes. I'm sure you can do it.

1098
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,860
- Come here.
- My goodness. Look!

1099
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,060
- That one too.
- That's pretty too.

1100
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,720
(Are you all coming home late tonight?)

1101
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,080
(Group Chatroom, 4)

1102
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,120
(I have plans. I'll be late.)

1103
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,190
(I'm going to practice basketball
before I go home.)

1104
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,290
(I'm coming home late today.)

1105
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,030
I don't want to watch it alone.

1106
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,340
What?

1107
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,380
I have something to give you.

1108
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,860
Gosh, I didn't know
these photos still existed.

1109
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,360
I was preparing for the festival.
I thought they were cool.

1110
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,460
By the way,

1111
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,860
how did you know this was me
in the photos?

1112
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,400
I changed a lot.

1113
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,230
Gosh, you didn't.

1114
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,170
You're still pretty.

1115
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,940
What?

1116
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,680
Si-a is the spitting image of you.

1117
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,150
Oh, right. Do you want to see her photos?

1118
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,220
She's cute.

1119
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,900
Is that Si-woo?

1120
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,960
Isn't he amazing?

1121
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:23,870
His eyes change
whenever he plays basketball.

1122
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,510
I should have gone
to his games more often.

1123
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,340
What a shame.

1124
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,740
You've been busy with work.

1125
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,180
You raised them as a working mom.

1126
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,950
You're incredible.

1127
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,450
Why do you

1128
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,620
talk like a grown-up?

1129
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:46,820
I might not look old,
but I'm very old on the inside.

1130
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,630
I still get nervous of making mistakes

1131
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,200
before my games.

1132
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:55,470
But

1133
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,400
when I see you on TV,

1134
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,300
you don't seem nervous at all.

1135
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,940
And you never make mistakes.

1136
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,640
Whenever I see you on TV,

1137
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,710
I always think you're so cool.

1138
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,380
Gosh. No, I'm not.

1139
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,650
I mean it.

1140
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:17,390
Si-a and Si-woo are rooting for you too.

1141
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:19,720
- Really?
- Yes.

1142
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:23,230
So you should continue showing them
how great you are on TV.

1143
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,260
Thank you.

1144
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,410
It started.

1145
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,260
(Da-jung,)

1146
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,520
(you are)

1147
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,760
(doing a great job.)

1148
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,270
(So don't worry.)

1149
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,400
(I'm sure)

1150
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:12,880
(you'll do a great job again.)

1151
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,220
How beautiful.

1152
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,540
(There are some things you notice
only after you have lost them.)

1153
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:46,180
Thank you for today. Get home safely.

1154
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,250
(A smile of my loved one.)

1155
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,750
(All right. Raise your left hand!)

1156
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,760
(Time you spent with your family.)

1157
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,130
(When I had them,)

1158
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,460
(I didn't know)

1159
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,500
(how precious)

1160
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:12,170
(they had been.)

1161
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,180
Yu-ju!

1162
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,390
Mom!

1163
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:38,930
No, Yu-ju!

1164
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,000
(Van Parcel Service)
No, Yu-ju!

1165
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,400
No, Yu-ju!

1166
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,670
Yu-ju!

1167
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,750
All right. Transport him to the OR slowly.

1168
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:09,660
He was in a car accident. His name is
Hong Dae-young. He was born in 1983.

1169
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:28,040
(8 years ago)

1170
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:34,320
Dae-young. Hong Dae-young!

1171
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,120
- Dae-young!
- Hold on.

1172
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,190
Dae-young.

1173
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,560
Your mom is calling you.

1174
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,090
Okay!

1175
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,370
Let the kids play a bit more. Okay?

1176
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,140
They are having fun.

1177
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,610
Kids' cafes are so convenient.

1178
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,710
But why now,
when our kids are all grown up?

1179
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,050
Right.

1180
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,710
Do you want to play with me?

1181
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:06,380
Sure.

1182
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,360
Who is that guy?
Why is he holding her hand?

1183
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,020
He must be Si-a's friend.

1184
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,430
Ja-sung.

1185
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:20,100
"Ja-sung"? I don't think he's her friend.

1186
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,030
I bet when Si-a brings
her future husband home,

1187
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,700
you're going to throw a fit.

1188
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:28,370
- What?
- Isn't it obvious?

1189
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,240
She's going to date
and have boyfriends later.

1190
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,810
And she'll get married too.

1191
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,210
What will you do
when she brings her boyfriend home?

1192
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:39,420
First, I'm going to break his leg.

1193
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,750
- What?
- And then,

1194
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,450
if he's a nice man, I'll fix his leg.

1195
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,360
And if he's a bad man, I'll break his other leg.

1196
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,490
Goodness.

1197
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:49,690
I don't think Si-a will be able to get married in this life.

1198
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,490
Don't bring up stuff like that.

1199
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,060
I'm already tearing up.

1200
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,970
It looks like I'm raising 3 kids, not 2.

1201
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:04,510
Come here, my baby. My poor baby.

1202
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,980
Were you sad? Is that it?

1203
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:42,610
(You can listen to "Someday" by Clara C
on major music streaming websites.)

1204
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,950
(We thank Lee Ki-woo for his special appearance.)

1205
