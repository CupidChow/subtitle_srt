I want you to prepare well and be on your toes.

166
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,820
And Go Woo-young, Hong Si-woo.

167
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,590
You guys are still on the reserve squad,

168
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,620
so I want you to clean everything up
before you go.

169
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,400
- Okay. You're dismissed.
- Thank you.

170
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,670
Coach.

171
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,040
Shouldn't everyone help out with cleaning up?

172
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,410
Why? Do you have a problem with it?

173
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,240
That's how everyone starts in the beginning.

174
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,550
Both the parent and the child
don't have any class.

175
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,530
Si-woo.

176
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,060
- You should throw this out and go home.
- Forget it. Let's do it together.

177
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,330
That will take longer.

178
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
- Let's finish up quickly and rest sooner.
- Okay then.

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,110
I'll see you tomorrow.

180
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Hey.

181
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,260
Go first.

182
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,470
(Serim High School)

183
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,610
I put in 50 percent more, like you asked.

184
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,720
Gosh, you're so exact.

185
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,620
(Don't worry about Ja-sung starting.)

186
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,620
Okay.

187
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,690
Please continue to show your support.

188
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,560
Right.

189
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,040
What was that just now?

190
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,240
Let's talk later.

191
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,880
Have you been paying him off
so that I could play?

192
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,420
Tell me!

193
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,850
I only filled in for
what you were lacking.

194
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,130
Is that something a father should say?

195
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,000
If you could play and go to college on
your own, I wouldn't have given him money!

196
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,970
Then don't give him any money.

197
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,300
I won't go either.

198
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm

199
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,340
embarrassed of you.

200
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,740
You punk!

201
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,150
You're always whining,
just like that mother of yours.

202
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,390
You just need to do what I tell you to do!

203
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,390
If not, I'll kick you out of the house
just like I did to your mother!

204
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,500
Gu Ja-sung!

205
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,390
Did it hurt?

206
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,860
Are you okay?

207
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
Why do you care?

208
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,270
You and Hong Si-woo always show up
at times like this.

209
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,100
Hong Si-woo?

210
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,440
Are you

211
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,010
bullying Si-woo because of that?

212
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,740
How embarrassing.

213
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,150
Hey, Go Woo-young. I'm warning you.

214
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,980
Watch your mouth.

215
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,850
Drink this.

216
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,320
You can drink on a day like this.

217
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,520
I told you to mind your own business.

218
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,830
Why are you bothering me?

219
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,570
I don't want you to have regrets.

220
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,570
I got hit by my father a few times too.

221
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,440
He wasn't always like that,

222
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,710
but after my mother passed away,
that's when it started.

223
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
You're not the one
who did something wrong,

224
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,180
so why should you do something
you're going to regret?

225
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,820
I didn't mean to see what happened,

226
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,860
but I'm sorry anyway.
I'll keep what happened today a secret.

227
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,590
To be honest, I quit drinking.

228
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,930
But I'll drink today with you.

229
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,330
Stop bluffing.

230
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,139
Are you trying to comfort me?

231
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,500
Why?

232
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,669
After hearing that I'm not good enough and
I only played thanks to my dad's money,

233
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,810
are you taking pity on me?

234
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,510
You're

235
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,620
a good player.

236
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,990
You would've been good enough on your own,

237
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,160
but your father just met the wrong people.

238
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,260
So don't you ever think
that you're not good enough.

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
And

240
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,400
don't do things that you'll regret later.

241
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,670
Even if it's someone you hate,

242
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,140
(turning your back on someone)

243
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
(for good)

244
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,010
will bring more sadness
to you than you think.

245
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,400
What? This is non-alcoholic.

246
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,430
(Fresh Zero)

247
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,300
Hey!

248
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,770
How do I take him home?

249
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
My back hurts.

250
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,280
My gosh.

251
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,020
How can he get drunk
on non-alcoholic beer?

252
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,870
He's still a kid, indeed.

253
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,590
(I knew it. I trusted you from the start.)

254
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,620
(Everyone is gathering
because we know you had it hard.)

255
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,820
(You have to come.)

256
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,760
(We'd like you to be
KD Bank's model again.)

257
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,490
(Please give me a call when you're free.)

258
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,430
How can everyone change just overnight?

259
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,240
Da-jung must've watched
the press conference too.

260
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,840
We're all here. Aren't you going to come?

261
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,090
I couldn't record him.

262
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,490
What should I do now?

263
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,690
Then the only way

264
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,830
is for a parent who has made a deal

265
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,700
with Choi Il-kwon to come forward.

266
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,530
If a parent who paid him testifies,

267
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
will they be punished?

268
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,270
They will be,

269
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,010
which is why it'll be hard
to get any parent to testify.

270
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,550
Give me a moment.

271
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,190
What?

272
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,420
Get out right now.

273
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,360
Do you even know where I am?

274
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,530
I'm busy working.

275
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,460
Your job requires you to slice
pork cutlet while you work?

276
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,230
What?

277
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Hey!

278
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,660
What, you're following me now?

279
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,990
Hop in.

280
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,230
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

281
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,330
Let's talk inside then.

282
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,660
You have one minute.

283
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,110
Hey! What are you doing?

284
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,560
(Ye Ji-hoon)

285
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,960
Hey, Mr. Ye.

286
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,530
(What's up?)

287
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,270
What are you doing?

288
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,440
Just having dinner.

289
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,510
Really? I was just going to eat too.

290
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,470
Enjoy your dinner.

291
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,140
All right. You too.

292
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,350
That's all?

293
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,280
(It's such a relief)

294
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,220
(that you aren't going to retire.)

295
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,220
- Here!
- What took you so long?

296
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,420
Where are you going?

297
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,320
- Ji-hoon,
- He ignored us.

298
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,730
I'm sure you'll do well.

299
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,830
Where is he going?

300
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,800
I'll cheer you on as your fan.

301
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Thanks.

302
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
What?

303
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,240
What brings you here?

304
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,470
I have to eat too.

305
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,410
And you just happen to be here.

306
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,280
What a coincidence, right?

307
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,050
Yes.

308
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,050
Did you come alone?

309
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,690
No, with my friends.

310
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,760
Why are you alone?

311
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,390
My friend stepped out for a moment,

312
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,460
but she's taking so long.

313
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,210
Are you crazy? Why did you bring me here?

314
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,380
This is where our history began.

315
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,480
How could you forget all about us?

316
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,320
I can't forget until I die.

317
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
You are

318
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,160
my first love!

319
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,130
Do you realize how old you are?

320
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,530
Goodness!

321
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,100
You can all go home from here.

322
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,170
What?

323
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,730
- Bye!
- Bye!

324
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,070
(Stop acting this way!)

325
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,200
(I can't!)

326
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,870
(- This has been going on for years.
- I can't give you up.)

327
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,540
Why are you so in love with me?

328
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,440
You're daintier than Kim Ha-neul
in my eyes,

329
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,310
prettier than Kim Tae-hee,
and cuter than Suzy.

330
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,710
I can't stop thinking about you all day.
What do I do?

331
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,850
You need to take responsibility for it!

332
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,750
She said no!

333
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Who are you?

334
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,830
Me?

335
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
(Don't do it. Don't you dare.)

336
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,700
(Please don't.)

337
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,930
(All right. I'll help you out.)

338
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,240
Who are you?

339
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,340
I'm Ae-rin's boyfriend.

340
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,910
You broke up with me to get
with someone like that?

341
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,820
In my eyes,

342
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,390
he's the sexiest man ever!

343
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,290
She thinks he's sexy?

344
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,160
Good one.

345
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,760
You two look great together.

346
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,330
I must be the weird one here.

347
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,570
Have a good life!

348
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,240
Thanks for helping out.

349
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,650
I'll get going first.

350
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,720
What a day.

351
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,260
What should we eat?

352
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,830
- Pasta!
- Pasta?

353
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,930
- Yes.
- Is that good enough?

354
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,760
Maybe steak, then.

355
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,100
Steak! That sounds great!

356
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,000
You scumbag!

357
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,440
That's ridiculous.

358
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,740
(I know.)

359
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,310
(My head is all over the place,
so I'm going home.)

360
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,010
All right. Don't worry about me.

361
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,310
Go home and rest.

362
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,420
Your friend isn't coming back?

363
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,290
No.

364
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,020
You can go talk to your friends now.

365
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,830
I'll get going first.

366
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,830
Let's go together.

367
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,740
I'll take you home.

368
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,370
It's fine.

369
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,910
Why? Is there a bus that gets you
straight to home this time too?

370
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,450
No,

371
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,450
but your friends are waiting.

372
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,290
I don't feel good about taking your offer.

373
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,920
I hope you wouldn't think so much.

374
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,630
Sometimes,

375
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,130
thinking and acting simple is the best.

376
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,270
Simple.

377
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,970
Thank you.

378
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,270
You're going to say no anyway,
so why thank me?

379
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,780
Are you saying that in advance
for when you get a ride later?

380
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,710
It's not that.

381
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,180
I'm just going through something
very complicated right now.

382
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,290
But thanks to you, I cleared my mind.

383
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,030
I'm only going to look ahead from now on.

384
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,560
I'll have your back, then.

385
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,640
I'm your first fan, remember?

386
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,170
I got your back.

387
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,310
Thanks for being my first fan.

388
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,340
Enjoy your night.

389
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,810
Get home safely.

390
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
It's okay.

391
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,650
I told you.

392
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,380
l always got your back.

393
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,500
No, he punched me first.

394
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,640
Gosh. It hurts.

395
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,470
Did you really punch him first?

396
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,740
Yes.

397
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,370
Since you're not hurt at all,

398
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,140
you should just settle
and let this one go.

399
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,850
My lawyer will take care
of the settlement.

400
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,080
I was talking to him, not you.

401
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,050
Can I make a call?

402
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,820
Will you really call your lawyer?

403
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,990
Gosh. Suit yourself.

404
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,460
(Agreement, Petitioner)

405
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,200
I'm at the police station.

406
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm with Choi Il-kwon.

407
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,800
I punched him.

408
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,970
I can put up with a lot,

409
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,840
but not when it concerns you, Ms. Ok.

410
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,640
- You crazy jerk.
- Let go of me. What?

411
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,810
- Give me that!
- Let go of me.

412
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,140
- Give me that.
- Let me go.

413
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,840
- Give me that. Take this.
- Sir. Help...

414
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,610
Come on.

415
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,080
(Trustworthy Seoul Police)

416
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,040
Gosh.

417
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,410
- Gosh.
- What happened?

418
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,620
It's nothing, Ms. Ok.

419
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,980
No, that's not true.

420
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,250
I saw him coming out of a hotel
with a woman with my own eyes.

421
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,690
Your boyfriend has been cheating on you.

422
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,990
Pardon?

423
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,630
Are you under the impression
Mr. Choi and I are dating?

424
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,370
Are you not?

425
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,870
This jerk said if people found out
you two were dating,

426
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,740
you would be uncomfortable.
He told me it was a secret.

427
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,870
Gosh. What are you talking about?

428
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,510
- Are you not well?
- Get your hands off me.

429
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,480
You said you've been dating her for a month.

430
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,080
You said that on the day you asked to meet

431
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,020
at the bar and gave me
the account numbers for money.

432
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,880
- You jerk. Do you want to die?
- Stop that.

433
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,720
Gosh, he keeps lying.
What's wrong with him?

434
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,930
I don't think he's lying.

435
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,630
Do you believe what this jerk said?

436
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Let's just say that I don't believe
you're telling me the truth.

437
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,670
And based on your words and actions,

438
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,670
I was able to see your true colors.

439
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,210
And Mr. Go,

440
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,680
I lied to you that day because
I didn't want you to pursue me.

441
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,310
Please don't misunderstand
our relationship.

442
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,150
Gosh.

443
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,150
Don't pretend that you didn't lead me on.

444
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,790
What did you just say?

445
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,750
Don't pretend to be so classy.

446
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,420
Look back on how you behaved.

447
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,430
You kept leading people on.

448
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,860
That's why even a fool like him
wants to date you.

449
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,700
Gosh. I know for a fact women like you
always pretend to be so noble.

450
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,500
- What did you say?
- How dare you insult her?

451
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,780
You came back as soon as you left?

452
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,050
- Just settle and leave.
- Okay.

453
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,180
No.

454
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,550
I can't settle
regarding his insult to Ms. Ok.

455
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,690
I wasn't talking to you.

Get up.

458
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,120
Stand up straight.

Gosh.

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,220
You deserve more beating.

461
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,660
This won't do.
You won't learn your lesson with this.

462

Don't move!

463

Get this. You deserve more beating.

Get that. I'm not done yet.

466
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,200
Get up, you jerk. Okay?

467
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,170
You psychopath.

It's okay. He's nice.

473

Is he violent?

474
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,490
Why would he hit you for no reason?

475
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,420
I've been beaten up for no reason.

476

I got hit by my father a few times too.

477
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,570
He wasn't always like that,

478
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,370
(but after my mother passed away,)

479
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,370
(that's when it started.)

480
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
He did?

(Principal's Office)

482
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,820
I'm sure you know a while ago,
Suheung High School's baseball team

483
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,220
was exposed for illegally bribing college admission.

484
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,990
I heard that the team wasn't doing so well

485
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,360
because the coach picked students
based on the bribes he received.

486

I hope

487

you aren't like that.

Gosh, sir.

489

I'm a teacher before a coach.

I have only chosen my players
based on their skills.

The team's performance is going down
as time passes by.

Will you be able to make it
to the national championships?

00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,280
and decide on my starting lineup
this afternoon.

495
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,990
If you don't trust me,

496
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,650
you can come and see it for yourselves.

497
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,120
We'll do that.

498
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,360
(Go, Serim High. You can do it!)

499
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,900
The new players are very good.

500
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,070
Yes, they are.

501
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,240
(Let's go, Serim High Basketball Team!)

502
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,270
All right.

503
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,940
I'll announce the starting players. Bang Gi-yong,

504
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,680
Gu Ja-sung,

505
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,680
Lee Jin-hyuk,

506
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,750
Hong Si-woo,

507
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,630
and Go Woo-young.

508
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,990
That's all.

509
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,130
I'll look forward to it.

512
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,340
Well done.

(Go Woo-young, Hong Si-woo)

514
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,020
Sometimes,

515
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,590
thinking and acting simple is the best.

517
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,760
(I'm Jung Da-jung, Hong Si-woo's mom.)

518
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,100
(Coach Choi Il-kwon asked for money
in exchange for a place in the lineup.)

519
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,730
(So I would like to get together
and discuss this in person.)

520
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,900
(I'll be at the cafe
in front of the school at 7 p.m.)

521
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,300
Woo-young.

522
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,999
My father had to work,
so I came here instead.

523
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,740
You didn't have to know.

524
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,840
It concerns me, so I should know.

525
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,880
Right.

526
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,979
But

527
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,820
it looks like no one is coming.

528
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,720
I hope

529
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,019
I'm not imposing on the other parents.

530
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,390
I like that.

531
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,430
You're trying
to make things better for us.

532
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,960
You're doing the right thing,
so don't think like that.

533
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,470
Okay?

534
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,410
Woo-young.

535
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,280
From now on,
you shouldn't come to meetings like this.

536
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,650
This is something
the adults should sort out.

537
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,420
You can just

538
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,230
focus on getting ready for the game.

539
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,530
Okay.

540
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,070
Wait here.

541
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,200
What?

542
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,430
Take this.

543
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,740
It's a digestive pill.

544
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,370
Okay. Thank you.

545
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,950
Oh, right.

546
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,920
How did you know I have indigestion?

547
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,490
I get like that when I'm stressed out.

548
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,330
Are you okay?

549
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,070
Yes, I am.

550
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,400
You don't look like it.

551
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,010
Give me your hand.

552
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,670
This is really effective.

553
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
How do you feel?

554
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,040
I feel like I'm getting better.

555
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Right?

556
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,980
What stressed you out this time?

557
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,390
Who gave my woman trouble?
I'm not going to leave them alone!

558
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,170
Okay.

559
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,710
I'm fine now.

560
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,080
I'll get going first.

561
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,830
Mom.

562
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,630
What's wrong with your face?
Is something wrong?

563
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,830
What could be wrong?

564
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,400
You can't fool me.

565
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,970
You can tell whenever Si-a lies, right?

566
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,940
It's the same with me.

567
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,310
There's nothing wrong.

568
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,380
You will never be able to fix that habit
of never sharing how you feel.

569
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,610
You're not a child anymore.

570
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,480
You have to take responsibility
of your child too.

571
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,950
Thank you, Mom.

572
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,180
I'm sorry.

573
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,770
Time flies.

574
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,010
Mom. Did you throw out the papers
that were on my desk?

575
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,510
Yes.

576
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,810
I organized your desk
while I was cleaning.

577
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,320
My gosh.
I told you not to touch my things!

578
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,420
Why are you getting mad?

579
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,020
Then why didn't you clean your room?

580
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,450
Who asked you to clean for me?

581
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,090
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

582
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,290
"Annoyed"?

583
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,930
Is that appropriate to say to your mom?

584
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,390
You touched my stuff without asking.
Of course I'm annoyed.

585
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,900
Grandma, tell Mom to stop.

586
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,200
Hong Si-a.

587
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,900
Why are you acting like that
to my daughter?

588
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,370
Pardon?

589
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,140
I won't forgive anyone
who upsets my daughter.

590
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,810
Even if that person is my granddaughter.

591
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,680
Apologize to your mom now.

592
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,250
Okay.

593
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,550
Mom, I'm sorry.

594
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,360
I had a daughter who's just like me,

595
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,600
just like you said I would.

596
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,400
Children are all immature.

597
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,170
I'm a mom and grandma because I'm here,

598
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
but in front of my mom,
I'm just her daughter.

599
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,320
So you can live as a mom
in front of your kids,

600
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,420
but to me, you can be a daughter forever.

601
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,090
If anyone upsets you, tell me.

I'm always on your side.

but I feel so full already.

604
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,430
What did you do until now
without having dinner?

605
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,340
I'll make you something to eat,
so go and get changed.

606
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Thank you, Mom.

607
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,410

608
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,620
I'm here, Mom.

610
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,030
Are you more familiar with this face?

Why does Dad drink so much these days?

Did you pack your socks?
What about a towel?

627
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,170
I packed everything.

are you sick?

worrying about me?

okay?

that I love you so much, right?

Gosh, that gave me chills.
Why would you say that?

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,990
Why am I just finding out
that she was sick?

661
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,430
Why didn't you say anything?

662
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,430
Why didn't you tell me anything?

663
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,430
It was all for your sake.

664
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,070
Mom.

665
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,740
Mom.

666
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,720
Mom.

667
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,660
Mom.

668
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,480
(Hey! No parents would want
to ruin their children's lives!)

669
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,680
You sound like you actually care about me.

670
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:15,820
You punk!

671
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,890
Do you actually care about me?

672
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,390
You care so much that you hid
Mom's illness from me?

673
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,830
That's why you told Da-jung
to get an abortion?

674
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,570
Did you ever think in my place?

675
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,570
You're just drinking every day.
Don't say that it's for the family.

676
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,340
You did nothing for the family.

677
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,780
No, don't do that.

678
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,980
Stop it!

679
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,230
If you leave now,

680
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,300
I will disown you!

681
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,620
Aren't you Woo-young?

682
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,460
- Hello.
- Anyway,

683
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,560
what brings you here?

684
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,200
My mother is resting here.

685
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,400
You're so young. It's unfortunate.

686
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,900
You can go on.

687
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,770
Yes, sir.

688
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,750
You can give that to me. I'll carry it.

689
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,820
- I'm fine.
- I'll take it.

690
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,760
It's fine.

691
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,630
Is it her death anniversary today?

692
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,140
Yes.

693
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,040
That's the same as my wife.

694
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,810
My wife also passed away years ago today.

695
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,350
It's been years

696
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,510
since I came on her anniversary.

697
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,450
Why is that?

698
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,190
My son couldn't be

699
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,060
with his mother in her deathbed
because of me.

700
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,460
I should've given him time
to bid her farewell.

701
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,460
I regret not doing that.

702
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,500
Since then,

703
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,300
I wanted him to at least have
some time with her on her anniversaries,

704
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,410
so I always came a day later.

705
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,950
But he's in Busan this year,

706
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,380
so I came right on the day.

707
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,880
Even then,

708
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,250
it seems like he came by earlier.

709
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,550
I see those flowers every time,

710
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,590
but I don't know what they are.

711
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,290
They're hyacinths.

712
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,630
What a difficult name that is.

713
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,300
I'm sorry.

714
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,240
Please forgive me.

715
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,180
What?

716
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,350
That's the meaning of the flowers.

717
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,220
He shouldn't be sorry.

718
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,690
We're sorry as his parents.

719
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,100
Honey, how have you been?

720
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,170
Look at the grass.

721
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,240
Gosh.

722
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,210
(Priority Seat)

723
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,090
(I didn't want)

724
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,160
(to live like my father.)

725
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,270
(My father was)

726
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,400
(a selfish man.)

727
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,370
(But...)

728
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,550
My dad can't come to watch me play.

729
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,550
Are you sad?

730
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,790
It's fine. He's always like this, anyway.

731
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,990
What do you mean?

732
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,230
He always says that he cares and nags,

733
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,430
but he only cares about himself.

734
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,630
(All along,)

735
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,040
(I was becoming just like my father.)

736

(The world is cold,)

737
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,620
(and alcohol was the only way)

738
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,260
(to forget about my long days.)

739
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,030
Si-woo,

740
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,660
you really shouldn't be playing around!
You need to study.

741
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:29,900
And Si-a!

742
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,000
All you do is hang out with your friends!

743
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,770
(I started to worry more and more)

744
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,140
(about whether my children could survive)

745
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,670
(in this tough world,)

746
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,310
(and the more the world struck me,)

747
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,950
(the more I yelled at them.)

748
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,650
- Where are you going?
- To meet a friend.

749
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,520
Don't come home late.

750
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,030
(Just like that,)

751
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,700
(I became distant from my children,)

752
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,200
(just like my father)

753
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,730

Sir,

756

if you have time, would you like to come
and watch the game tomorrow?

757

Si-woo is?

759
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,140
I'll make time if I have to!

760

Please come.

761

All right.

762
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,080
- You can give it to me now.
- It's okay. It's light.

00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,500
You were so cool.

826
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,000
(Dad,)

827
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,000
(you said you were the happiest)

828
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,440
(when you watch me play.)

829
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,110
(I wanted to show you again.)

830
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,730
(I'm sorry)

831
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:23,830
(that it took me so long.)

832
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,770
(I'm sorry,)

833
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,940
(Dad.)

834
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,740
Dae-young.

835
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,920
I am

836
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,700
sorry.

837
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,720
I'm sorry.

838
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:02,830
(If you're busy, you don't have to come.)

839
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,570
(Epilogue)
(If you're busy, you don't have to come.)

840
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,870
I didn't get to see your last game.

841
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,540
I'll make it to this one.

842
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,240
Today's game is the last preliminary game.

843
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,410
Where are you now?

844
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,180
It's been a while
since I've been to the stadium.

845
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,750
So I got lost a bit.

846
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,780
I'll be there soon.

847
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:20,950
Okay.

848
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,290
Da-jung!

849
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,390
(Serim High School)

850
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,100
Dae-young.

851
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,410
No.

852
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,410
It's okay.

853
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,410
You shouldn't have come.

854
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,420
No. This is my decision.

855
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,020
Don't cry.

856
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,830
You're my future.

857
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,930
And our baby is my future.

858
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:12,770
So

859
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,840
just trust me.

860
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,170
Excuse me.

861
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,260
(Da-jung.)

862
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,430
Go out with me.

863
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:23,840
(Don't worry, Da-jung.)

864
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,940
I'll take care of you.

865
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:43,720
I love you.

866
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,040
(I'm okay.)

867
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,470
(I'm putting you through a lot.)
