If only that'd be the case for us.

By the way, what about
the monks who complained?

18
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:59,164
They gave some ridiculous reasons
as to why it shouldn't be excavated,

19

but the county office will
put the complaints to rest.

Tell me about it. Shall we?

Mr. Kwon, we'll talk about this later.

That should be cleaned.

- Right, of course.

Is that discoloring or a blindfold?

33

It seems more like a blindfold.

("Monthly Mystery")

89

In 1915, while attempting
to restore Seokguram,

90
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,910
Japan introduced a construction technique
that was new at the time.

One that uses cement.

92
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:55,251
Cement was paved everywhere
to prevent humidity,

93
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,510
but it led to condensation and
moss on the inner walls and statue.

94
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,259
Only a temperature drop of 1°C...

95
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,721
can slow down the
movement of water molecules.

96
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,389
That it could lead to condensation...

97
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,520
was a fact known by people
even 1,000 years ago.

98
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,149
But those who excavated the relics
1,000 years later...

99
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,400
were clueless to say the least.

some relics or events from the past...

102
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,780
might be better off to stay buried.

103
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,241

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,780
Here.

164
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:10,361
We think this statue of
Buddha was discovered...

165
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,410
at the old site of Horan Temple
which was built in Goryeo Dynasty.

166
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:18,831
That temple had a statue
of Buddha haunted by evil.

167
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,630
Yes, you're talking about
the haunted Buddha statue.

168
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,881
Yes. That is correct.

169
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,750
According to "Eou yadam",

170
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:27,841
even after it was sealed,
misfortune did not stop.

171
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:32,471
So they built another statue of Buddha
to stop the strange events.

172
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:36,101
Then what is the problem?

173
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,810
In short,

174
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,190
there is an initial haunted Buddha statue,

175
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,530
and we believe that is
the one in your magazine.

176
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,700
When we heard the initial
haunted Buddha statue...

177
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,451
was excavated in Mount Cheonbo,

178
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,410
we tried to stop them from excavating.

179
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,121
But the county office handled it
with more haste than caution.

180
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,121
So where is it now?

181
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,871
We are doing our best to find it.

182
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,800
The initial haunted Buddha statue
has the most vicious evil spirit.

183
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,961
We must find it as soon as possible.

184
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:11,010
And this is the photo when it was found.

185
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,760
We are here to ask you if you can
look up what it says here.

186
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,150
It's in Tibetan.

187
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,361
He used to be...

188
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,320
a promising genius in
ancient Buddhism studies.

189
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,741
I see.

190
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,831
You see,

191
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,621
I could find what it means,

192
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:45,251
but lately, I'm into something.

193
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,630
I don't know if I'll have time for it.

194
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:49,381
I know you're not busy.

195

and gets paid monthly.

197
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,390
But I'm a freelancer.

198
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,601
- Yes.
- Time is money.

199
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,929
So I need to get paid for my research.

200
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,480
Hey. Don't you rip off monks.

201
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,769
It is okay.

202
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,689
- We must pay him.
- Pardon?

203
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,020
It is okay.

204
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,320
We will pay you as much as you want.

205
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,660
But since this is an urgent matter,
please hurry up.

206
