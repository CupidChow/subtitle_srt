What should I do?

143

First, you must seal the haunted statue

I should seal the statute
with my eyes closed?

Darn it.

168
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,521
You. Where is your bus?

169
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,777
My bus?

170
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,817
It's right in front of the building.

171
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:59,236
- Remove the items near the door.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:02,222
Wait. Are you going to remove them?

173
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:03,624
What are you going to do?

174
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:05,163
Can I kill all those people outside?

175
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:06,753
Why do you care about them?
The ones who are alive matter more.

176
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:08,044
Please save me.

177
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,423
You heard him, didn't you?

178
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:12,134
- You go first. Hurry up.
- Okay.

179
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:15,173
Yes. Hurry up and
remove those things. Come on.

180
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:17,263
Why are you doing this to me?

181
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,763
- No.
- Stop!

182
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:22,223
Mr. Kwon. Save me!

183
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:23,274
Please...

184
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:25,524
- No!
- Don't!

185
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:27,943
- No.
- Remove them quickly.

186
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:30,774
- I got this.
- Come on.

187
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:35,114
Please, no.

188
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,284
Come on.

189
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:39,743
- Mr. Kwon. Save me!
- No!

190
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,074
That's why you need this.

191
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,903
If you want to protect yourself.

192
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,713
You take care of it yourself.

193
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,384
This is the end for us.

194
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:43,413
My goodness.

195
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:45,453
Hey.

196
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:49,243
I can't see anything.

197
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,503
Hold on.

198
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:58,753
What are you doing? Hurry up and go.

199
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:01,054
I said, hurry up.

200
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,223
Keep going!

201
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:26,703
Let go of me!

202
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:31,203
Oh, no.

203
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:34,753
What are you? You jerk!

204
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:37,253
- Die!
- Save me!

205
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:39,344
Hey, keep going. Let's go together.

206
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:41,634
- Here!
- Open the door.

207
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:43,344
- Why won't it open?
- Hurry up.

208
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,804
Gosh.

209
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:54,024
Hurry!

210
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:56,814
Close the door!

211
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:57,943
Start the engine!

212
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,483
Wait for me! Yong Ju!

213
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:04,703
Yong Ju!

214
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,453
Yong Ju!

215
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,874
Hurry up and close the door! Go!

216
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:12,413
Close it!

217
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,693
The song is great!

218
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:38,104
You've got good taste, sir!

219
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:55,433
What are you thinking?

220
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:59,104
Think of the haunted Buddha statue.
You won't save anyone at this rate.

221
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,774
The haunted Buddha statue, okay?

222
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:42,274
Byung Hoon. It wasn't me.

223
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:43,693
I didn't kill him.

224
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,824
- Stay away from me.
- You scumbags!

225
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:49,824
No, don't do this to me. It wasn't me!

226
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,574
It's a misunderstanding!

227
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:54,364
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

228
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:48,524
Darn it, what a day.

229
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:31,564
What are you doing, Mom?

230
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,114
Come on, get up.

231
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:43,243
Kill her. Kill her, you jerk!

232
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:48,874
Hey.

233
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:50,673
Are you all set?

234
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:52,134
We are.

235
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:04,347
The universe, heaven and earth,
the first month...

236
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:07,477
in the southwest of Saba world,

237
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:10,227
on the east sea of South Korea.

238
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:14,322
We're ready too. We can do it. Let's go.

239
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:19,268
Which way is it? Come on.

240
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,528
It's the building on the far left.

241
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:23,273
Right, the building on the far left.

242
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,583
Close your eyes.

243
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:29,504
Do not look into the eyes of
the haunted Buddha statue, okay?

244
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:32,304
What kind of crazy situation is this?

245
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:36,595
Let's go.

246
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:14,099
- To the spirits of the universe,
- To the spirits of the universe,

247
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:18,148
heaven, and earth,
we pray with all our hearts.

248
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:20,488
Please help us with the good and evil...

249
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:23,698
- and give us mercy.
- And give us mercy.

250
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,408
- To the eight provinces...
- To the eight provinces...

251
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,249
We did it, Chief. We did it!

252
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,039
You're okay, right, Chief?

253
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,628
Chief?

254
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,628
- Yes.
- Nothing was behind us, right?

255
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,599
Come on, answer me.
