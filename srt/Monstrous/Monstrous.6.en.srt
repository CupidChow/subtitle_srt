Mom.

168
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:34,219
Mom.

169
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,019
Yes, it's your mom.

170
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,987
I'm not stronger than you anymore.

171
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:01,277
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

172
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:05,537
It hurts.

173
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:11,096
Soo Jin.

174
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:14,977
I heard...

175
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:17,936
Ha Young's voice.

176
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:23,237
Me too.

177
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,076
I'm ready.

178
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:33,166
You need to blow them out at once.

179
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:35,037
In 1, 2.

180
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:40,876
- I did it!
- You look so nice. Stay there!

181
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:42,876
Why did you put the cream on my face?

182
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:49,217
In 1, 2, 3.

183
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:32,085
We moved some shattered pieces of
the haunted statue of Buddha...

184
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,164
to the lab.

185
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,964
We also had a consolation ceremony
for them to enter Nirvana.

186
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,585
Let there be the mercy.

187
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:41,255
Great work.

188
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,674
By the way,

189
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:48,884
we couldn't find the doll of Jung Ki Hoon.

190
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:52,193
What do you think that was?

191
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,613
It's not only evil spirits
who come to things.

192
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:59,415
Good spirits also come to things.

193
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:03,072
I think the Buddha came...

194
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:06,908
to their broken relationship.

195
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:15,233
By the way,
I hear Professor Jung and Professor Lee...

196
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,942
are in Tibet now.

197
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:20,033
Yes, they started
their research again there.

198
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:22,831
They started a YouTube channel...

199
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,752
and are visiting places
with monstrous accidents.

200
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:27,291
- Is that it?
- Yes.

201

You should subscribe to the channel too.

205
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:43,198
You should like and subscribe.

206
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:46,052
Since we're on the subject,

207
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:49,518
why don't we start a YouTube channel?

208
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,347
- A YouTube channel?
- Yes.

209
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:54,147
Monks who catch ghosts. What do you think?

210
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,228
Reality is a trend nowadays.

211
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,897
We must work hard to enter Nirvana,
not work on a YouTube channel.

212
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:01,698
We could enter Nirvana by doing this.

213

(A year later)

214
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:24,725

Yes.

216
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,261
Let's go.

217
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:38,688
Be careful.

218
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:49,123
