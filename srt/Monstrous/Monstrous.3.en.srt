You know better than anyone else...

00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:29,584
that Won Seok would never do that.

10
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,254
Of course, ma'am. I know that.

11
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:36,346
The victim is someone
Won Seok was close with.

12
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:38,725
He told me Won Seok would
never do something like this...

13
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:41,346
and that something must've happened.

15

Thank you.

16
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:48,486
- Thank you, Chief Han.
- No problem.

17
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:50,736
Where's Mr. Bang Won Seok's guardian?

18
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:53,405
- Yes, over here.
- The test results are in.

19
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,656
Please follow me to the doctor's office.

20
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:59,906
Chief Han, can you come with me?

21
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,535
What if I don't understand
what the doctor is saying?

22
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:07,415
Okay. I'll go with you.

23
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,804
Hello.

24
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:22,015
I'm the police chief of Chunggeum
Patrol Station in Jinyang-gun.

25
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,144
This is Mr. Bang Won Seok's mother.

26
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:26,856
- Hello. Please have a seat.
- Have a seat.

27
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:35,526
Did you find anything
that could be the cause?

28
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:39,156
His blood alcohol level and
everything else was normal.

29
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:42,955
These numbers say he only
had a couple of sips of soju.

30
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,296
This much alcohol doesn't make someone
become so violent.

31
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:49,376
Then...

32
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,835
It's not like there are drugs
in the countryside.

33
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,346
Won Seok isn't the kind of person
to do such a thing either.

34
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,846
We ran tests as soon as he
was brought in last night.

35
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,645
His glutamate numbers were off the charts.

36
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:07,186
This is a couple of hundred times higher
than the average person.

37
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:08,686
A couple of hundred times higher?

38
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,936
What is it, and why is it so high?

39
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,905
It's one of the
excitatory chemicals in your brain.

40
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,984
If your body excretes too much of it
and your receptors get damaged,

41
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,734
it could cause problems
with your cognitive abilities...

42
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,535
such as memory loss and hallucinations.

43
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:23,155
Is it possible for your body
to excrete too much of it...

44
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,996
all of a sudden?

45
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:26,456
I'm not sure.

46
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:28,836
While it could increase by little,

47
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,586
I've never seen the numbers
go up a hundredfold.

48
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,754
What's even stranger is when we ran
the tests again in the morning,

49
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,676
all of the numbers were back to normal.

50
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:41,345
To be honest, up until last night,

51
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,346
we thought the patient would pass away.

52
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,145
Oh, Lord.

53
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,265
Then what about Won Seok?

54
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,854
We gave him sedatives,
so he's unconscious right now.

55
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,235
But he'll wake up soon.

56
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:55,235
The broken collarbone will require him
to stay here a few more weeks.

57
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:59,235
Aside from that, he's okay.
So don't worry too much.

58
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,485
Thank you.

59
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,285

00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:08,285
Blocking?

164
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,865
The government declared Jinyang-gun
as a state disaster area,

165
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:12,746
where it had black rain.

166
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:14,544
According to National Institute
of Environmental Research,

167
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:18,006
the black rain might contain
components used in chemical weapons.

168
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,875
The chemical components in
the rain seem to be related...

169
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:22,294
- to fatal incidents yesterday.
- Let there be the mercy.

170
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,636
Take a look at this.

171
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:27,055
What is...

172
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,596
The sealing is gone!

173
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,226
- How is this...
- What should we do?

174
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,975
(A wish-granting Buddha statue
in Jinyang-gun office.)

175
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:37,475
Jinyang-gun is blocked.

176
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,315
You must turn your car around and go back.

177
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,814
Jinyang-gun is blocked.

178
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,615
You must turn your car around and go back.

179
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,365
Turn your car around, please.

180
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:46,824
- Turn your car around.
- Please.

181
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:48,534
You cannot enter. You must go back.

182
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:49,996
Jinyang-gun is blocked.

183
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,325
Turn your car around.

184
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:53,705
Turn your car around, please.

185
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,785
Jinyang-gun is blocked.

186
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:58,455
- Go back, everyone.
- I can't move my car.

187
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:03,756
What are you going? I said, go back!

188
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:10,975
Salut! Hello, everyone.

189
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:14,556
Well.

190
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,316
What's going on?

191
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,646
Who are you?

192
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:22,316
Do you have a girlfriend?

193
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,565
Why do you ask me that? Just go back.

194
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:26,695
You cannot enter.

195
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,155
My wife...

196
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:30,576
lives at the entrance of Jinyang-gun.

197
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,326
She's weak.

198
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:34,536
You can't go in. You should go back!

199
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,585
Please. I'll be fast.

200
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:40,255
Jinyang-gun is blocked completely.
You can't go in.

201
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,796
If it's an emergency,

202
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,555
shouldn't we be able to bring
our families out from there?

203
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:50,764
You should allow us to do that.

204
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:53,346
It's a guideline from
the government. Go back.

205
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,015
The guideline from the government?

206
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,816
- I beg of you.
- What are you doing?

207
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,856
Make the cars turn around.

208
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,815
This man's family is inside.

209
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,315
You must be the man in charge.

210
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:07,365
What's the issue?

211
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,276
My mother has diabetes.

212
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,325
She often gets insulin shocks.

213
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,866
She ran out of insulin.

214
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:16,664
So, I was on my way from a hospital
to get more insulins.

215
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:17,875
And this happened.

216
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:20,204
He said his wife was sick
and didn't say that.

217
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:23,046
Come on. My mom could be sick.

218
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,296
And my wife could be sick at the same time.

219
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,964
Jinyang-gun is in danger
due to a highly contagious virus.

220
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,636
Until we figure out the components
in black rain, you cannot go in.

221
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:32,975
Please follow the guideline.

222
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,764
If the strong virus is spread inside,

223
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:38,265
shouldn't you rescue people?

224
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,514
Are you going to leave them there to die?

225
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,396
It's the guideline from the government.
Please comply with it.

226
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,655
Everyone, the government is...

227
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,616
blocking the place and
leaving people to die,

228
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,325
when our families are in there.

229
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:55,704
He's right.
Why should we follow the guideline?

230
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:58,785
- Let us go in!
- Right!

231
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,835
- Let's go in.
- Stop!

232
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:02,455
Did you just hit me?

233
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:05,876
Ma'am, I don't think
we can go into Jinyang-gun.

234
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,174
I'll turn around.

235
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,465
Wait, sir. We're almost there.

236
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,056
I'm sorry, but I need to eat.

237
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:14,765
I'll turn the car around.

238
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:17,845
- His mom is sick.
- Let us go in!

239
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,355
When can we go in?

240
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:21,895
Ma'am, you can't come here. Get out.

241
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:25,395
Ma'am? I'm the chief of
Chunggeum Patrol Station!

242
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:26,645
You can't go in now.

243
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:29,025
We don't know if people in there
are alive or dead.

244
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:31,154
Who gives the ridiculous command?

245
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:32,826
We need to know the cause first.

246
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,535
So, who gave the command?

247
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:36,904
- Hey! Turn the car around now!
- Hey!

248
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,325
- We'll leave the cars here.
- Let us go in!

249
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:42,376
- It's insane.
- Calm down, please.

250
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,165
Is he not answering?

251
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,215
He's not answering.

252
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,254
Why isn't the police picking up the phone?

253
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,135
It says there are too many calls coming in.

254
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,845
Sir, what is happening now?

255
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,764
Why is everyone acting insane?

256
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,474
Yes. You should
explain what's going on, sir.

257
00:19:57,475 --> 00:19:59,055
What is happening now?

258
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,015
It's all because of the
rain from yesterday.

259
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:03,515
The rain?

260
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:07,985
Think about it.

261
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:12,485
We had the darn black rain.

262
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:14,445
It rained.

263
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:17,115
Yes. It must have contained
something strange in it.

264
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,036
Some sort of a virus.

265
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,415
- A virus?
- A virus?

266
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:23,036
A Virus?

267
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,745
There was a virus in the rain?

268
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,965
Yes. That's making everyone go crazy.

269
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,295
The infected ones are not humans.

270
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:35,096
We should kill them all or we'll die.

271
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:39,265
- Kill...?
- Kill people?

272
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,346
You saw them.

273
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,515
Do you think they're humans?

274
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,356
They're not humans.

275
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,735
- How can we kill them?
- They're not humans.

276
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,445
What should we do?

277
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:09,836
Is it Dad?

278
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,175
- Dad?
- Be quiet!

279
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:24,935
- Stay quiet.
- Mom, what's wrong?

280
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,066
- Don't speak.
- It's Dad.

281
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:30,566
Just for a moment.

282
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:32,896
- Mom.
- Be quiet just for a moment.

283
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:41,366
Quiet!

284
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:55,255
- Don't move.
- I want to go out.

285
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:13,776
Mom, I'm tired.

286
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:17,905
- Dad.
- Ha Young.

287
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,205
What happened?

288
00:22:33,215 --> 00:22:34,255
Look.

289
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,965
Look! We have an infected one in here.
Go hold her now!

290
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,755
- What?
- Get out of my way!

291
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:42,425
What's happening?

292
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:45,685
I told you...

293
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:47,396
that we need to kill them right away.

294
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:49,225
Don't!

295
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:51,396
- Hold him.
- What?

296
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:53,066
Hold him.

297
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:55,566
Come here.

298
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:58,155
You jerk. Are you out of your mind?

299
00:22:58,316 --> 00:22:59,445
You punk.

300
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:01,576
Are you crazy?

301
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,904
Let go of me! Don't kill her.

302
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,076
Stop! You punk...

303
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:10,286
- You little...
- Calm down.

304
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:14,546
That's not a human.

305
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:20,346
What are you doing?

306
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:22,755
He's trying to kill her
in front of everyone.

307
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,056
No one is stopping him?

308
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,096
What are you going to say
when you get rescued later?

309
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:27,556
Han Do Kyung.

310
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:29,265
I'll tell the police...

311
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,265
you were all part of it.

312
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,205
Han Do Kyung. You darn jerk!

313
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,465
Tell them.

314
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:04,886
Tell them I killed her.

315
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:33,955
Stop it!

316
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:37,165
You punk.

317
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:43,175
Stop it, you darn punk.

318
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:53,685
Yong Ju.

319
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:58,566
Don't.

320
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:08,616
You may not enter Jinyang-gun.

321
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:10,116
Please comply with the order.

322
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,366
- Or I will have to arrest you.
- Look.

323
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:14,455
How long do we have to wait?

324
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,455
This is absurd.

325
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,755
What are you talking about?

326
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:39,106
We got a call.

327
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:53,116
Darn it!

328
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,346
Hello?

329
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:13,515

330

Who are you?

331
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,856
My name is Han Do Kyung.

332
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:20,105
The lady suddenly passed out.

333
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:22,606
She passed out? Did Soo Jin pass out?

334
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,945
Do Kyung. Please calm down.

335
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:26,695
Can you tell me where you are...

336
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:28,655
and what is going on?

337
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:31,745
- She suddenly acted weird.
- Weird? How?

338
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:34,155
Do Kyung? Is that you?

339
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,455
Mom?

340
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:37,995
Yes, it's Mom.

341
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,046
Where are you? Are you okay?

342
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,126
I'm in the county office.

343
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:45,336
What is going on?

344
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:47,715
Hello? This is the governor of Jinyang.

345
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:49,296
What? Who?

346
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:51,715
The governor. The governor of Jinyang.

347
00:26:53,015 --> 00:26:54,596
Okay. Mr. Governor.

348
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:58,356
Is everyone in the county office?

349
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:00,605
Yes, but we're locked up.

350
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:02,649
Where are you? If you're outside,

351
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,173
can you head to the police station...

352
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:07,735
and call the police or SWAT team for us?

353
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:11,526
I'm the chief of Chunggeum Patrol Station.

354
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:13,655
Oh, are you?

355
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:15,245

Please take good care of him.

359

00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:25,004
Oh, thank you.

361
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,924
Please hurry up.

362
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,045
Can you put my son on the phone?

363
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,215
Yes, one second please.

364
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:30,755

366
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,725
Don't act up.

367
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:39,056
Listen to what grownups say and
stay quiet until I get there.

368
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:40,224
Okay.

369
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,264
- Okay.
- We're citizens of this country.

370
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:45,396
- Why is my son locked up...
- Han Do Kyung?

371
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:46,945
Hello?

372
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:52,826
I think your son is with my wife.

373
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:54,326
They're in the county office.

374
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:55,905
The county office?

375
00:27:58,326 --> 00:27:59,536
Do you have a car?

376
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:01,415
Yes, I drove here.

377
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,504
I know another way to get to the village.

378
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,546
Let's go that way.

379
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:08,255
Where's your car?

380
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,086
My car...

381
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:11,925
It's that green Galloper over there.

382
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,515
Your mother was a police officer?

383
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:24,014
Everyone. You can relax now.

384
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,974
The police will be here soon.

385
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,659
We're safe now.

386
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,118
We must stay calm in times like this.

387
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,579
You should not get worked up.

388
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,749
Young man.

389
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,039
Don't be too mean to others.

390
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,750
You shouldn't do that to
people who are older than you.

391
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,129
Everyone.

392
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,669
We're safe.

393
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,169
That's a relief.

394
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,010
I didn't do anything.

395
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,050
- Sir, thank you.
- I know.

396
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,389
- This is great.
- Hey.

397
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:53,099
Hey.

398
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:55,770
Let me ask something.

399
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:58,315
Among you,

400
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:02,270

401
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:05,144
raise your hand.

402
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,159
I got rained so much yesterday.

403
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:14,438
I was soaked.
I had to go home and get changed.

404
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,710
All of a sudden, dark rain started pouring.

405
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,588
Mr. Governor.

406
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:29,760
Please help me.

407
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,639
Sir...

408
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:39,810
Oh, my back. Help me, sir.

409
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,649
Hey. Tie him up.

410
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,189
What are you doing?

411
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,359
Tie everyone who raised their hands.
They'll go crazy at any minute.

412
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,408
Yes. You're right.

413
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:56,369
It's best to be careful.

414
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,369
Besides,

415
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,629
just so you know,

416
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,089
I'm not a young man.

417
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:14,139
- Tie them up.
- Yes.

418
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,429
Tie them.

419
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:25,688
Wait.

420
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:26,859
Not me.
