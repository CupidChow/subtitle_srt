According to Mr. Jung Ki Hoon,
these symbols are hard to read...

And being sealed in
multiple layers of seals...

means it's no weak evil spirit.

Stand straight, you piece of trash.

What are you doing, scumbag?

169
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:00,852

What are you going to do about this?

180
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,424
You can do it.

186
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:19,723
That scumbag.

187
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,273
Do you want me to catch him again?

188
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,064
Just let him go.

189
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:25,603
Wait until he's done with his thing.

190

Yes, sir.

191

It's green Galloper.

192
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:54,223
It won't start engine again.

193

Okay. Please come as soon as possible.

198
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,454
Is he a scamming jerk or something?

199
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,174
Are you doing this on purpose?

200

What's your problem?

201

What is it? What's the problem?

Let me see.

You should've called me beforehand.
Why did you handle this like this?

Calm down.

205
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:54,823
It's because the schedule
changed out of nowhere.

I told you we had
contacted the headquarters.

It's a sign that something bad will happen.

which led to the damage

the rain did not harm the crops.

On what grounds are you saying that?

My lungs are acting up again.

327
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:12,652
Just a second.

328
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:14,074
Goodness.

329
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,863
- Let me answer...
- Unbelievable.

330
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:23,203
Check this out.

331
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:34,717
Is there a fire somewhere?

332
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,774
- What is that?
- What is going on?

333
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:57,903
What is the twerp doing up there?

334
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,994
- Where?
- What's wrong with him?

335
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:04,163
If only I could jump once more.

336
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,623
If only I could jump once more.

337
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:09,044
Do you think I can't do it?

338
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:17,504
A thorough inspection
must be completed first...

339
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,422
for there to be compensation.

340
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,223
- Which is why...
- You know,

341
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:23,343
I doubt we'll get to hear
anything concrete today.

342
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:25,724
- Once analyzed...
- I'm afraid I have plans today.

343
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:28,182
- Like I said...
- I'll be heading back first.

344
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:30,484
- Already?
- What time was it again?

345
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:31,773
- It was 2am.
- Two in the morning, sir.

346
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,733
- Enough with gibberish.
- Two in the morning?

347
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,903
Just tell us how we'll be compensated.

348
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:37,823
Of course, you should be compensated.

349
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:40,652
But what I've been saying isn't gibberish.

350
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:41,902
Goodness, sir.

351
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:43,243
No compensation can be made...

352
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:45,784
without the damage being analyzed first.

353
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:50,123
Who are you?

354
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:54,423
Who are all these monsters?

355
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,383
Mr. Kim.

356
00:26:56,844 --> 00:27:00,344
Come on, Mr. Kim. What has gotten into you?

357
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:01,974
Get a grip on yourself.

358
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,923
- Open the door.
- Move!

359
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:41,713
Run!

360
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:45,724
Move!

361
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:49,353
- My gosh.
- Sir, this way.

362
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,014
Sir!

363
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:55,564
Here I come!

364
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,403

365
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:03,824
Why you...

366
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:09,244

367
