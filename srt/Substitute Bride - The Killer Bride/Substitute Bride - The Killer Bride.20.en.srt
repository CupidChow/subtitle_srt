[The killer bride]

00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,800
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,720
Look at this.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
The evidence is irrefutable.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,120
[Criminal Si Yueyao, He Yunxing's wife, is actually a spy of Daqiu.]

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,470
If you want to live,

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,110
be a good girl and sign it.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,030
Master Mao, you're really eager, aren't you?

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,430
You've even prepared the document for me to frame He Yunxing.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,670
You know what?

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,110
Since I came in here,

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,730
I've never planned on leaving alive.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,810
I didn't realize

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,350
you were such a tough girl.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,670
Come on.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,560
Let's see

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,520
how long you can stay tough.

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,070
By the way,

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,570
what was that technique of He Yunxing's called again?

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,470
Ah, yes.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,320
The Soul-Capturing Needle,

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,070
right?

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,590
Well,

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,750
I learned a trick from the old folks in the harem too.

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,020
Today,

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,230
I'll try it out on you.

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,840
Uh-oh.

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,300
I didn't get it right.

29
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,670
This one hit the right spot.

30
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,730
Will you sign it or not?

31
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,060
Stop!

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,940
Your Highness. Mr. Gu.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,220
This is not a place you should come to.

34
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,220
Pack your things.

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,360
It's time for you to return to the capital.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,950
Master Mao. I'm afraid what you're doing

37
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,530
smacks of framing a court official, doesn't it?

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,780
I'm here on imperial orders to investigate.

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,070
But it seems to me that you're seeking personal revenge, Master Mao!

40
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,950
My grandpa, His Majesty, sent you here to conduct a fair investigation,

41
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,480
yet you're trying to force a confession here.

42
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,030
I didn't expect Your Highness and Mr. Gu

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,210
to be friendly with this spy of Daqiu.

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,990
If His Majesty were to find out,

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm afraid...

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,790
What are you talking about, Master Mao?

47
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,230
Her Highness and I are only here

48
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,079
to ask Sui Feng

49
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,430
how he has been using us until now.

50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,390
Alright.

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,980
Your Highness and Mr. Gu,

52
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,650
please proceed with your questioning then.

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,470
Move aside!

54
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,220
Yueyao.

55
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,510
Is Yunxing

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,610
okay?

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,810
Master Mao wouldn't let him in.

58
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,360
He knew Master Mao would give you a hard time,

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,420
so he asked us to come and check on you.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,150
Changning.

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
Mr. Gu.

62
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,230
I want to ask you

63
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,709
for a favor.

64
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,890
[Penalty Prison]

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
How is Yueyao?

66
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,810
She's alright. She's doing fine inside.

67
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,760
Don't worry.

68
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,120
Has something happened to Yueyao?

69
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,230
Yueyao asked you not to force your way in.

70
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,760
Let's think of another way.

71
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,909
We'll make sure you see her tonight.

72
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,460
That's more like it.

73
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,830
Don't you think?

74
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,470
Oh, Mr. Gu.

75
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,340
Mr. Gu.

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,050
You've brought us wine again.

77
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,560
This is fine wine.

78
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,910
Drink up, brothers!

79
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,160
Oh, it smells so good.

80
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,430
Let's try it.

81
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,630
This wine is really good.

82
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,700
Even better than the wine we had at lunch.

83
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,500
You're right.

84
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,550
Oh, this wine...

85
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,420
This is strong stuff.

86
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,180
I'm so dizzy.

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,230
Ooh, wow, this wine really packs a punch.

88
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,050
I can't take it anymore, either.

89
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,080
This...

90
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,230
Go.

91
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,190
