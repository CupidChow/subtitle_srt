[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,950
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,590
Come at me if you dare!

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,750
Then I'll send you on your way.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,670
Don't come any closer.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,970
You...

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,980
Can't you speak?

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,030
If you can't speak,

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,230
write it down.

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,130
I am

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,440
the real Lady Zhao Qingqing, He Yong's wife.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,150
Your aunt,

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,330
the current Mrs. He, is an impostor.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,060
Just because she looks exactly like me,

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,790
she has taken my place.

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,980
She poisoned me mute and locked me in a dark prison.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,610
How could this happen?

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,110
Damn it!

19
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:12,800
Then...

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,090
That ghost I ran into last time was you, wasn't it?

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,070
That day she brought me food,

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,590
she left in a hurry and forgot to lock up.

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,030
So I escaped.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,310
But she still caught me and took me back.

25
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,390
[He Yong]

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,509
Uncle

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,310
has already passed away.

28
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,550
My condolences, Aunt.

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,540
The fake Zhao Qingqing didn't kill my aunt all these years,

30
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,210
but wanted to silence her the day she got the border defense map.

31
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,750
She wanted to use my aunt as her scapegoat

32
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,230
to quietly leave the General's Mansion.

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,380
With the truth,

34
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,990
interrogating the fake Zhao Qingqing should be much easier.

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,170
He Yunxing has Master's darts,

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,970
and knows Master's techniques.

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,790
Now looking closely at his height and build,

38
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,670
they're also similar to Master's.

39
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,950
Could he be Master?

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,500
What's wrong?

41
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,190
Did I hurt you just now?

42
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,420
I don't know.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
My stomach suddenly hurts.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,640
Let me carry you to bed to rest.

45
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,970
Thank you, Honey.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,150
Hey.

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm suddenly fine again.

48
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,160
I just remembered I have something to do.

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,030
I'll go first.

50
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,950
Didn't you just say your stomach...

51
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,790
It's nothing.

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,420
You go about your business.

53
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,150
I'm going to find my master now.

54
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,920
Changning,

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,670
I think I've been poisoned.

56
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm dying.

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,490
No, you won't.

58
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,329
To be able to hold your hand like this before I die,

59
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm so happy.

60
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,930
If before I die,

61
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,400
I could hug you again,

62
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,980
I would die without regrets.

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,960
No,

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,390
you won't die.

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,220
The doctor will be here soon.

66
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,000
You'll be fine.

67
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,370
Before I die,

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,780
can I ask you one more

69
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,910
sincere question?

70
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,850
Go ahead.

71
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,990
Do you like me?

72
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,840
Even if

73
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,070
it's just a little bit.

74
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,910
I...

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,830
I think I...

76
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:38,980
Doctor!

77
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,270
Doctor!

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,870
He's been poisoned.

79
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,110
He's dying.

80
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,990
Please save him quickly!

81
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,850
Your Highness, please let go.

82
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,000
Doctor, how is he?

83
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,600
Mr. Gu is fortunate and no vital organs were affected,

84
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,470
but it's still extremely dangerous.

85
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,870
It's penetrating wound.

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,390
We must treat it with utmost care.

87
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,390
He needs to rest and recuperate peacefully.

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,270
It will take time to recover.

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,390
What about the poison?

90
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,790
Is the poison under control?

91
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,830
Mr. Gu wasn't poisoned at all.

92
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,110
What?

93
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,210
How dare you lie to me!

94
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,350
Your Highness,

95
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,850
this could worsen the injury.

96
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,390
If the heart meridian is damaged,

97
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,990
even Hua Tuo couldn't save him if he were alive.

98
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,520
I'll let you off this time since you saved my life.

99
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,600
This is the finest wound medicine.

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,830
Please apply it to Mr. Gu, Your Highness.

101
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,560
I'll go prepare the decoction.

102
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,040
Doctor, this...

103
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,300
How am I supposed to apply this?

104
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,580
Hey, doctor!

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,190
Ah!

106
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,860
Don't move.

107
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,530
What are you looking at? Turn around!

108
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,070
I just made a mark on He Yunxing's neck.

109
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,770
If the mark is still there,

110
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,190
then he is my master.

111
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,720
Master.

112
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,800
Could you be He Yunxing?

113
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,090
I pay my respects, Master.

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,700
You're injured.

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,680
I might have been hit by

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,260
the enemy's Storm Pear Blossom Needles.

117
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,150
Let me take a look.

118
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,980
Could I have been mistaken?

119
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,470
Master isn't He Yunxing?

120
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,920
Are you alright?

121
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,440
It is you after all.

122
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,470
Why did you do this?

123
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,050
You're clearly my master, so why did you send me to kill youself?

124
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,780
I...

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,330
I was planning

126
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,700
to tell you everything

127
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,000
after capturing Sui Feng.

128
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,600
I want to know the truth now.

129
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,980
The whole truth.

130
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,100
Fifteen years ago,

131
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,560
your mother brought you, at three years old,

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,420
to the He mansion to work as a cook.

133
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,470
At that time,

134
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,970
you liked to cling to me.

135
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,800
Brother Yunxing,

136
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,550
will you play with me?

137
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,380
Sure.

138
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,580
So we became playmates.

139
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,040
We grew up together.

140
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,960
Until that year...

141
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,230
Mother!

142
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,110
Mother!

143
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't run!

144
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,710
Mother!

145
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,669
Mother!

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,370
After your mother passed away,

147
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,610
you sought revenge against Sui Feng.

148
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,180
But Sui Feng severely injured your heart meridian.

149
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,770
You were in a coma for days.

150
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,520
When you woke up again,

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,350
you had lost your memory

152
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,420
and were no longer fit to practice martial arts.

153
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,420
I knew

154
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
that once you regained your memory,

155
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,240
you would definitely seek revenge against Sui Feng.

156
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,970
I was afraid of triggering you,

157
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,220
so

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
I took on the identity of a masked master

159
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,640
to teach you qinggong,

160
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,760
poison-making,

161
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,330
in case of need.

162
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,300
I spent four years

163
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,190
becoming the leader of the Shisi Government Office

164
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,500
just to find Sui Feng and avenge you.

165
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,550
One month ago,

166
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,940
I received a secret message that Sui Feng was coming to Tingcheng.

167
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,500
So I came.

168
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
To ensure your safety,

169
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,610
I issued the assassination order to you

170
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,340
so you can come to Tingcheng

171
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,080
and me.
