00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,880
[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,690
Stop there.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,760
Master Mao.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,380
What do you want this time?

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,510
The situation on the border is volatile.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,090
I am here to take the head of Si Yueyao, the spy of Daqiu,

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,500
to deter the enemy state

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,290
and demonstrate the prestige of our Qing State.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,540
This is also for the greater good.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,080
It gives you a chance

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,910
to prove your loyalty to His Majesty, Lord He.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,460
It's killing two birds with one stone.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,070
Lord He,

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,580
sorry for any offence in advance.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,330
Do it.

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,110
Wait!

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,390
Master Mao.

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,390
I didn't know our Qing State's prestige

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,080
needs to be demonstrated through a woman's head.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,950
Your Highness, don't forget that

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,310
Si Yueyao was the leader of Daqiu's spies.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,930
You...

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,650
Master Mao.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,230
Even if you want to deter the enemy state,

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,950
you don't have to use such bloody means, do you?

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,140
Only by letting all the people see it

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,160
can it have a deterrent effect.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,780
I actually have a way

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,520
that can meet your needs

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,360
while keeping my wife's body intact, Master Mao.

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,630
If you can handle this matter well, Lord He,

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,510
I'll return the commander's token to you immediately.

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,350
May I ask how you plan to do it?

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,700
Cremation.

36
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,370
What did you say?

37
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,330
The raging flames

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,870
will not only burn away Si Yueyao's sins during her lifetime,

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,390
but also let the people see

40
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,050
how the spies of the enemy state

41
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,470
will end up.

42
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,150
What do you think, Master Mao?

43
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,850
Good.

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,870
No wonder His Majesty favors you so much, Lord He.

45
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,310
I'm deeply impressed as well.

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,590
Then I'll

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,320
watch closely how you handle this.

48
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,030
Let's go.

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,630
He Yunxing.

50
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,190
How can Yueyao's body remain intact if you do this?

51
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,320
And how can she possibly rest in peace?

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,460
Your Highness.

53
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,870
What position are you in to object?

54
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,570
You...

55
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,840
Changning.

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,390
You've indeed gone too far.

57
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,740
I didn't expect He Yunxing to be so cold-blooded and heartless.

58
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,370
Yueyao loved him so much,

59
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,350
yet he actually...

60
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,940
Changning.

61
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,710
If you can't bear to watch,

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,110
let's go back first.

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,460
No.

64
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,250
I must send Yueyao off for the last time.

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,810
Bring me Si Yueyao's autopsy report.

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,640
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,250
Why is the age left blank?

68
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,950
Sir.

69
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,330
According to the official records,

70
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,830
Si Yueyao is 18 years old.

71
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,870
But after examining the body,

72
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,279
I found that the deceased was actually at least 25 years old.

73
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,820
Do you know the masks

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,930
involved in Qiao Niang's case?

75
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,990
I do, sir.

76
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,750
They were used by Daqiu's spies for disguise.

77
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,909
Their craftsmanship is superb,

78
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,240
making it hard to distinguish between the real and the fake.

79
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,440
How dare he deceive me!

80
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,390
Master Mao.

81
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,360
You're a man of your word.

82
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,750
Now that I've got it done,

83
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,470
please return my token

84
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,670
and reinstate me.

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,670
I always keep my word.

86
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,750
Thank you, Master Mao.

87
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,340
He Yunxing.

88
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,320
You better behave yourself.

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,560
Otherwise, the next one to be set on fire will be you.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,210
You see?

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,950
If I hadn't replaced you with a man of sacrifice in disguise,

92
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,420
this Lord He

93
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,830
would now be stepping over your corpse to get his job back.

94
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,430
Now you should believe me.

95
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,890
You're half Daqiu.

96
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,890
And now in the Qing State,

97
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,390
you're officially dead.

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,950
Your best option now

99
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,630
is to defect to Daqiu.

100
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,480
You're right.

101
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,510
This is my best option now.

102
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,710
But after all, I come from a military family.

103
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,390
I can't be some nobody.

104
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,230
I want to meet your leader, Sui Feng.

105
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,390
It's not easy

106
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,070
to meet our leader.

107
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,970
What are your conditions?

108
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,890
I want you to kill He Yunxing with your own hands.

109
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,190
This is for you.

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,390
Is it pretty?

111
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,120
It is.

112
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,430
From now on, I'll always carry this sachet

113
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,870
with me.

114
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,710
Yueyao.

115
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,340
Where are you?

116
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,320
Yueyao?

117
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,030
Yueyao!

118
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,800
He Yunxing!

119
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,350
Let me ask you.

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,580
Four years ago,

121
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,320
was it you who reported my mother's identity as a spy?

122
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,280
Is that how you got into the Shisi Government Office?

123
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,390
Yes.

124
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,050
Did you know my identity,

125
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,510
and the fact that I'm General Si's biological daughter all along?

126
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,660
All these years,

127
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,270
you've gone to great lengths to keep me by your side.

128
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,600
You just wanted to use me to get close to the Si family, right?

129
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,800
I didn't.

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,870
Still trying to deceive me?

131
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,950
He Yunxing.

132
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,300
Go to hell!

133
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,549
Why didn't you dodge?

134
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,140
Si Yueyao.

135
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I sacrificed so much for you,

136
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,730
yet you've never trusted me.

137
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,360
I took that stab

138
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,750
as returning your favor.

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,210
This sachet...

140
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,310
I'm giving it back to you!

141
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,280
From now on,

142
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,280
we'll part ways,

143
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,400
owing each other nothing.

144
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,960
Catch the spy!

145
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,900
Catch the spy!

146
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,150
Yueyao?

147
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,270
You...

148
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,820
Wait.

149
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,160
What happened to you?

150
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,340
Yueyao did this?

151
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,420
Si Yueyao stabbed you?

152
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,450
She's indeed not dead.

153
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,310
After her!

154
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,150
Yes, sir!

155
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,620
Master Mao!

156
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,100
Mr. Gu.

157
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,670
Come here.

158
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,670
Go.

159
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,310
Okay.
