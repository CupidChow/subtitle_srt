00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,650
You killed my husband!

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,250
Aunt, please calm down.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
Yueyao couldn't have killed uncle.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,370
You still want to cover for her?

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,030
I saw it with my own eyes.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,230
Si Yueyao killed your uncle.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,790
Aunt, are you sure you saw Yueyao

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,530
kill uncle with your own eyes?

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,630
When I arrived, she was the only one here.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,680
Who else could it be if not her?

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,250
I will investigate

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,410
and uncover the real culprit.

[General's Mansion]

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,110
The border defense map is indeed missing.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,150
Since Sui Feng has appeared in the mansion,

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,680
we must catch him this time.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,640
Honey!

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,990
Honey!

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,630
You murderer!

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,350
Murderers will go to the eighteenth level of hell!

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,430
If I did it, I wouldn't deny it.

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,910
But if I didn’t,

25
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,170
I won’t let myself be falsely accused.

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,230
Oh, Honey!

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,200
You died so tragically!

28
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,230
This woman.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,620
She's indeed a jinx!

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,160
Don't be afraid.

31
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,509
Do you believe me?

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,630
I believe you.

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,900
Sir.

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,110
General He died with blood streaming from his orifices,

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,979
and his veins are completely ruptured.

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,979
Sir, please look.

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,270
This wound on his chest

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,430
is fatal.

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,190
General He died under strange circumstances.

40
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,420
Judging by the bloody handprint on the table,

41
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,509
I suspect

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,080
General He tore out his own heart.

43
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,020
Yunxing, how can a person tear out their own heart?

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,990
You must avenge your uncle!

45
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,070
Don't worry, Aunt.

46
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,710
I will definitely uncover the truth

47
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,870
and give Uncle a full explanation.

48
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,790
Continue.

49
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,110
Sir,

50
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,880
the scent emanating from General He's body is very strange.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,510
It was this scent that controlled General He,

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,090
making him lose his mind.

53
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,950
Soul-controlling incense.

54
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,130
It's a secret drug unique to the Daqiu spy Sui Feng.

55
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,970
I think

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,560
I smelled a similar scent on your aunt.

They are all suspects.

64
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,070
I remember now.

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,390
At the scene where my mother was killed,

66
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,850
there was also this scent.

67

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,990
I don't want to kill He Yunxing anymore.

72
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,660
Why?

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,230

75
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,079
I won't kill him.

my mother was killed by someone using soul-controlling incense.

79

who the real culprit is that harmed my family.

83
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,710
Can you tell me now?

Sir, it's that scent again.

108
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,430
The culprit is spreading this scent in the mansion

109
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,790
to cast suspicion on all the female family members

110
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,590
and prevent me from finding him.

111

Aunt, I have something to ask you.

112
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,490
Aunt, the fragrance you're using seems unusual.

113
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,580
Where did you get it?

114
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,700
The real culprit is still at large,

115
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,150
yet you're concerned about women's fragrances?

116
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,130
Aunt, you misunderstand.

came to sell fragrances in the mansion.

Your uncle saw that the female family members all liked it,

Yes, Sir.

154
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,420
Could the fragrance be a tactic used by the real culprit to confuse us?
