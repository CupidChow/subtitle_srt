[Episode 14]

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,910
Father.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,100
No need for such formality.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,840
Yunxing,

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,030
this great victory

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,560
was indeed due to their redeployment of troops

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,110
to attack the weak spots on the fake border defense map,

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,150
falling right into our ambush.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,670
It's all thanks to your strategy.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,230
You're too kind, Father.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,070
This was only possible

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,030
because of your many years of war experience,

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,200
which allowed us to create such a convincing false defense plan

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,810
that lured the enemy in.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,020
With this victory,

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,330
we severely damaged Daqiu's army.

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,530
The border

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,440
will be peaceful for a while.

20
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,290
I imagine Sui Feng and his forces will also settle down for a while.

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,030
You truly are my good son-in-law.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,770
You're too kind, Father.

23
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,630
Father.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,050
Yueyao, how have you been lately?

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,510
Father...

26
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,430
What...

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,920
What happened to you?

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,350
Where did you get this?

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,220
This is...

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,260
This is the jade pendant Mother left for you.

31
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,430
Inside,

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,630
there's a letter from her.

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,850
Yueyao,

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,670
you...

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,110
Are you really my Yueyao?

36
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,830
I am your real daughter,

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,810
Si Yueyao.

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,240
Good.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,890
As long as you're alive.

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,430
It's been over ten years.

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,380
I sent people everywhere to search for you,

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,710
but there was no news.

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,280
I thought you...

44
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,710
I thought you and your mother...

45
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,900
I was wondering why I felt

46
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,520
you looked so much like her the first time I saw you.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,630
Heaven has been kind to me.

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,970
Yueyao,

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,510
can you call me Father?

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,870
Father.

51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,480
Yes.

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,329
My dear daughter.

53
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,400
It was all my fault for being incompetent.

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,800
I knew long ago that your mother's identity was unusual,

55
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,320
but I failed to protect the two of you.

56
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,470
Now that your mother has passed away,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
you must remember

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,090
never

59
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,620
to tell this to outsiders.

60
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,750
Do you understand?

61
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,550
Si Cheng knew long ago that Yueyao's mother's identity was unusual?

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,390
Gu San.

63
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,630
What are you sneaking around for?

64
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,200
I...

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,030
I was just about to go in,

66
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,390
but my wound suddenly started hurting.

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,190
Let me take a look.

68
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,730
Your Highness?

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320
Mr. Gu?

70
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,829
We heard that General Si is here,

71
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,490
so we came to pay our respects.

72
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,810
Please come in.

73
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,370
Please.

74
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,170
Please.

75
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,550
General Si.

76
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,720
Greetings, Your Highness, Mr. Gu.

77
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,590
What made you so sad?

78
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,950
Mr. Gu, this is not sadness.

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,470
These are tears of joy.

80
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,710
Yueyao, my adopted daughter,

81
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,010
turns out to be

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,030
my long-lost biological daughter.

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,300
I've long heard that your wife passed away due to a serious illness,

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,390
and Miss Si, in her sorrow, went out alone and unfortunately got lost.

85
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,649
Who would have thought

86
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,570
the fate would be so miraculous?

87
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,190
Indeed.

88
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,610
It is also thanks to

89
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,810
His Majesty's blessing

90
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,310
that my daughter and I

91
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,520
were able to be reunited.

92
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,090
Father.

93
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,830
Yueyao, you're no longer an orphan from now on.

94
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,880
You now have a father who loves you.

95
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,300
From now on, you not only have a father,

96
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,430
but you also have me,

97
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,030
and us.

98
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,659
That's wonderful.

99
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,460
I'm truly happy for you, Yueyao.

100
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,670
Yunxing,

101
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,550
this drink

102
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,670
is for you,

103
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,140
for the care

104
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,070
you gave them back then.

105
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,710
It was my duty.

106
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,160
I also didn't expect

107
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,910
that you were Yueyao's biological father.

108
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,600
Back then, during the border war,

109
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,320
the court urgently sent me to the frontier.

110
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Later, I received a letter from home

111
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,940
saying that they had gone missing.

112
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,150
I was so anxious

113
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,950
and desperate to return to the capital,

114
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,280
but the war was intense,

115
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,510
and I couldn't leave.

116
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,770
I could only send people to search for them everywhere.

117
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,940
After the war ended,

118
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,350
I returned to the capital and continued searching.

119
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,630
For over ten years,

120
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,510
there was no news.

121
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,230
I thought they...

122
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,840
I thought Daqiu's spies had...

123
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm not a good husband,

124
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,400
and I'm an even worse father.

125
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,670
Father,

126
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,590
it has been so many years.

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,730
Please don't blame yourself anymore.

128
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,750
No matter what,

129
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,950
I still need to thank you.

130
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,190
Back then,

131
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,170
if you hadn't saved Yueyao

132
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,300
from the spy's blade,

133
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,550
my daughter and I

134
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,320
would probably never have been reunited.

135
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,950
Yueyao and I

136
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,280
were childhood sweethearts,

137
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,850
But

138
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,690
my greatest regret

139
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,800
is that I couldn't save Mother.

140
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,670
Yunxing,

141
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,510
I want to visit her.

142
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,470
Okay.

143
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,740
I never thought there would come a day when Daqiu would lose to Qing State.

144
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,270
And it's all thanks to you.

145
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,200
I deserve to die.

146
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,870
It was all because He Yunxing put on a play that was so convincing.

147
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,070
We were all deceived.

148
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,990
If we weren't on opposing sides,

149
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,250
I might actually admire him a little.

150
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,160
Were you also a part of this?

151
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,350
No, no.

152
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,350
I was not.

153
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,600
Give this to her to eat.

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,630
This time,

155
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,110
we must bring down both He Yunxing and Si Cheng in one decisive move,

and complete the task I gave you within ten days.

160
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,620
Once it's done, I will give you the antidote.

161

Otherwise, you can wait

162
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,540
