[Episode 28]

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,350
I'm here to handle the case under His Majesty's order.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,480
Who dares to stop me?

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,450
Guards!

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,720
Kill He Yunxing!

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,120
I'd like to see who dares!

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,230
His Majesty issued a decree.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,870
Li Mao, the Seal Keeping Eunuch of the Inspectorate,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,330
shall return to the capital immediately for interrogations!

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,090
Li Mao,

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,830
you've been quite smug these days.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,510
You abused your power to eliminate dissidents.

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,120
I've reported all your doings to Grandpa.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,330
Forgive me, Your Highness.

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,050
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,590
My doings

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,790
were indeed inappropriate.

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,710
But I did everything for the country.

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,470
Right?

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,330
Li Mao,

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,790
say those words to my grandpa

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,870
after you return to the capital.

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,789
Master Mao.

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,110
His Majesty ordered you to go back.

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,030
What? Do you want to disobey the order?

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,180
I dare not.

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,180
I dare not.

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,800
I'll go back immediately.

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,260
I'll go back immediately.

31

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,900
Are you guys... alright?

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,570
We're fine.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
He Yunxing, you're injured again.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,750
It's just a minor wound.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,710
It's nothing.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,890
Fortunately, you came in time.

[General's Mansion]

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,240
Here.

40
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,590
Sir.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,150
My Lady.

42
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,370
We received good news from the front line.

43
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,430
General Si achieved a great victory.

44
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,250
In this battle, Qing State destroyed Daqiu's warehouses

45
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,010
and severely damaged Daqiu.

46
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,070
Yes.

47
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,110
After this battle,

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,990
I guess Daqiu won't have the capability

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,520
to invade our country over the next ten years.

50
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,610
Qing State's army gave Daqiu a good thrashing.

51
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,380
What pleasant news!

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,240
Well,

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,079
does that mean

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,390
Changning doesn't need to go for a political marriage anymore?

55
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,110
Yes.

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,030
That's right.

57
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,310
His Majesty has withdrawn the order about the political marriage.

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,190
I have also petitioned His Majesty

59
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,720
to bestow marriage upon us.

60
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,720
Congratulations, Mr. Gu.

61
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,030
Your wish has come true.

62
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,710
Come on.

63
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,200

are a perfect match.

Today, I bestow marriage upon you.

May you two be of one heart and one mind

70

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,160
Today, I just realized

77
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,480
although Tingcheng is on the border,

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,180
it is still a beautiful place.

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,420
It's truly rare.

80
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,480
Unfortunately, I'm about to leave.

81

Hmm...

Take it.

If you miss me,

88
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,670
just take a look at it.

89
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,430

I have a way to make them come back to Tingcheng again.

122
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,470

Yes.

Now that His Majesty has bestowed marriage upon us,

142
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,520
you should call me Honey, right?

143

Of course.

154
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,190
That is the result of my hard work.

155

After all, I shamelessly pursued you for so many years.

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,510
You were not shameless.

157
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,740
You were loyal and persistent.

191
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,310
How about Red Bean Soup with Tangerine Peel?

192
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,420
♫No regrets, just forever with you♫

193
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,640
That's what I was thinking too.

194
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,340
♫It's love, love, love for you♫

195
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's go.

196
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,280
♫I can't stop thinking of you, never wanting to part♫

197
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,470
My name is Si Yueyao.

198
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,290
♫With you by my side♫

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,800
I remember everything now.

200
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,830
♫Even the air is filled with anticipation♫

201
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,310
I have a childhood sweetheart who's like a brother to me,

202
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,470
a dedicated master,

203
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,810
♫You're my only destination♫

204
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,880
and a loyal lover.

205
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,650
♫No matter how hard the journey is, it's all worth it for you♫

206
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,230
His name is He Yunxing.

207
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,760
♫Just you and me♫

208
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,310
♫Together♫
