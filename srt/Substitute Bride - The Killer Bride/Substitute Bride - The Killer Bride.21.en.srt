[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,950
[Episode 21]

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,560
What are you looking for?

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,390
The Pharmacopoeia.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,450
At a time like this?

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,230
Why are you looking for the Pharmacopoeia now?

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,230
To make medicine.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,320
What kind of medicine?

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,390
Turtle Breathing Pill.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,390
Turtle Breathing Pill?

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,420
What is that?

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,430
Something to help Yueyao escape.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,090
I'll help you look for it then.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,620
Found it.

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,490
We have 20 hours left.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,740
Can we make it work?

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,269
Hey.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,390
We've tested it on that rat so many times,

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,310
and it still hasn't worked.

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,510
We've only got eight hours left. Can we make it work or not?

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,580
Si Yueyao.

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,870
Are you sure you won't reconsider my proposal?

23
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,190
Your number is up,

24
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,150
yet you're still so calm.

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,579
Wait!

26
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,190
I...

27
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,590
I still have something to say to Si Yueyao.

28
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,990
Your Highness, please don't let emotions cloud your judgment.

29
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,030
I'm my grandpa, His Majesty's most beloved princess.

30
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,290
Master Mao, as you work in the imperial court,

31
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,400
won't you do me this favor?

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,220
Then I

33
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,440
will grant you this favor, Your Highness.

34
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,450
I wonder how things are going with them.

35
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,910
Why haven't they come yet?

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,760
Yueyao, don't be afraid.

37
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,540
I will protect you, I promise.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,520
Your Highness, it's about time.

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,410
The hour has come.

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,560
It's time to send Si Yueyao on her way to the netherworld.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,860
I'm not done yet!

42
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,710
Guards!

43
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,130
Escort Her Highness back to rest.

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,670
I'd like to see who dares to touch me!

45
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,720
Your Highness, are you trying to delay the execution?

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,270
You...

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,270
Master Mao!

48
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,970
Master Mao.

49
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,810
I want to personally see her off.

50
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,700
After all,

51
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,510
we were husband and wife.

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,030
Very well.

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,750
I'm sure Mrs. He would be pleased with this arrangement.

54
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,910
Lord He, you're indeed ruthless.

55
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,630
Your future is bright indeed.

56
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,270
Master Mao, I'd like to bury her myself.

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,510
I hope you will allow it.

58
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,030
Of course you may.

59
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,980
Please.

60
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,580
I suddenly remembered that

61
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,280
Si Yueyao is skilled in the use of poisons.

62
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,060
If the poison failed to kill her completely,

63
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,340
wouldn't all our efforts be in vain?

64
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,310
Don't you agree,

65
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,790
Lord He?

66
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,170
Yueyao.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Yueyao.

68
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,680
Yueyao!

69
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,390
What are you trying to do?

70
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,070
I'm going to kill you

71
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,440
to avenge Yueyao.

72
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,070
Yunxing!

73
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,790
Don't worry.

74
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,350
Since I asked a man of sacrifice to save you using disguise,

75
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,870
of course I won't kill you.

76
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,900
Do you want to know why I saved you?

77
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,590
I saved you

78
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,150
because of your mother, Yao Pan'er.

79
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,870
You killed my mother,

80
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,440
yet you're saying you saved me because of her?

81
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,350
Ridiculous.

82
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,900
Your mother's death can't be blamed solely on us.

83
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,410
Your father, Si Cheng,

84
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,630
and your husband, He Yunxing, both played a part in this.

85
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,780
You're talking nonsense.

86
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,640
My mother's letter clearly stated the whole truth.

87
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,390
It was you who pushed my mother to the brink of death.

88
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,630
It was you who killed my mother!

89
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,710
Silly girl.

90
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,730
Is this the letter you're talking about?

91
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,140
[To Si Cheng, my husband: I was a spy sent by Daqiu to the Qing State.]

92
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,110
How did this letter end up in your hands?

93
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,470
I forged this.

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,980
Does it look like the real one?

95
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,570
Think carefully.

96
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,050
Where did you get

97
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,920
that previous letter?

98
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,350
Did you actually see your mother write that letter?

99
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,240
Couldn't it have been forged by Si Cheng?

100
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,930
How is that possible?

101
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,190
Why not?

102
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,200
Yueyao.

103
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,670
I grew up with your mother. We ate and lived together,

104
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,680
trained together,

105
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,830
and we came from Daqiu to the Qing State together.

106
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,900
We were once the closest of friends.

107
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,909
Back then,

108
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,840
after Si Cheng discovered your mother's identity as a spy,

109
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,870
he wanted to kill both you and your mother.

110
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,750
Your mother fled with you to protect you.

111
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,730
Think about it carefully.

112
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,840
If your mother hadn't deliberately gone into hiding,

113
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,840
how could Si Cheng have failed to find any trace of you?

114
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,350
No way.

115
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,120
And if Daqiu

116
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,840
really wanted her dead,

117
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,350
we would have killed her long ago.

118
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,350
Would we have waited over ten years?

119
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,050
This can't be true.

120
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,890
I don't believe it.

121
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,950
I saw Sui Feng kill my mother with my own eyes.

122
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,750
Is what you see always the truth?

123
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,750
Then you also saw with your own eyes

124
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,720
that He Yunxing was originally a helpless orphan,

125
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,690
but after your mother was killed,

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,830
he smoothly entered the Shisi Government Office.

127
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,270
In just four years,

128
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,909
he underwent a complete transformation

129
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,440
and became the Chief Commander of the Shisi Government Office.

130
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,740
What are you implying?

131
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,470
He climbed to his high position

132
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,570
by stepping on your mother's corpse.

133
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,600
That's nonsense!

134
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,830
You don't believe me?

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,760
Then see for yourself.

136
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,270
He Yunxing has made meritorious contributions by reporting Yao Pan'er's identity as a spy.

137
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,810
Although the spy is already dead,

138
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,590
merits should still be rewarded.

139
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,750
He Yunxing is hereby permitted to enter and serve in Shisi Government Office.

140
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,950
Look carefully.

141
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,140
This bears the golden seal of the Emperor of the Qing State.

142
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,760
[...Merits should still be rewarded. He Yunxing is hereby permitted to enter and serve in Shisi Government Office.]

143
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,760
[He Yunxing has made meritorious contributions by reporting Yao Pan'er's identity as a spy. Although the spy is already dead...]

144
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,180
No one can forge this.

145
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,640
I know it's hard for you to accept this right now.

146
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,030
I will let you see the truth with your own eyes.

147
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,650
Yueyao.

148
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,530
After I avenge you

149
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,680
and your mother,

150
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,090
I will come to you.

151
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,180
Then we can

152
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,550
be together forever,

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,890
never to be separated again.

154
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,560
We can play pitch-pot,

155
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,300
fly kites,

156
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,730
and visit the night market you'd been longing for.

157
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
We'll go eat delicious sugar cakes.

158
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,430
The silver threads used for disguise...

159
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,370
She is not Yueyao.
