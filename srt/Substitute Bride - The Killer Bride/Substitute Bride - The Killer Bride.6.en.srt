[The killer bride]

00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,990
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,510
Ghost!

4
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,940
That's it?

5
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,800
I was almost scared to death.

6
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,430
There are no such things as ghosts in this world.

7
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,310
I think

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,490
someone must have dressed up as a ghost to scare people.

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,150
I'll take you to catch the ghost.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,110
I'm not going.

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,840
I'll go by myself then.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,700
Don't leave me alone!

13
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,910
Gee, come on.

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,730
Don't be afraid, there are no ghosts.

15
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,340
Ouch!

16
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,670
This is the first time you've thrown yourself in my arms.

17
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,330
But you came on a bit too strong, don't you think?

18
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,880
Changning.

19
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,789
Changning!

20
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,910
Don't move.

21
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,920
-My nose.
-Changning.

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,180
It hurts so much.

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,520
Be careful.

24
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,610
How do you feel?

25
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,350
What happened just now?

26
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,060
How did you end up like this?

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,310
We saw a female ghost.

28
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,860
Yes.

29
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,700
That female ghost looked exactly like your aunt, Madam Zhao.

30
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,810
Zhao Qingqing?

31
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,360
Ouch, my nose hurts so much.

32
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,000
Lord He, can you take a look at it for me?

33
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,030
Your Highness, you are noble.

34
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,310
I'm your servant. We're of different status.

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,970
I dare not overstep my bounds.

36
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,700
Hey, hey, let me do it.

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,380
Why don't you ask me?

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,520
Don't worry, Changning.

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,070
A man must bear sole responsibility for his own actions.

40
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,250
I will be responsible for you.

41
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,070
Do you think I need you to be responsible for me?

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,750
I, Gu Shaozhen, am a man of my word.

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,420
I said

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,550
I'd protect you forever.

45
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,390
Forever.

46
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,170
I don't want you to protect me.

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,090
I want...

48
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,040
He Yunxing can protect you.

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,510
Changning is a noble princess.

50
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,670
Tingcheng is such a dangerous place.

51
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,110
Of course she needs someone with great martial arts skills to protect her.

52
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,620
You are so good at martial arts.

53
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,880
You can definitely keep her safe, right?

54
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,010
Don't speak nonsense.

55
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,470
The Shisi Government Office is commanded by His Majesty himself.

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,670
How can its duties be changed at will?

57
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,790
Since Her Highness was brought here by Mr. Gu,

58
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,860
Mr. Gu should be responsible

59
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,790
for Her Highness's safety,

60
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,600
right?

61

[Lifelong Commitment]

62
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,470
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

63
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,940
It's getting late.

64
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,410
You should leave now.

65
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
We need to rest.

66
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,740
Leave.

67
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,769
Go.

68
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,310
Hurry up and leave.

69
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,269
You too.

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,910
Leave now.

71
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,440
Changning.

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,460
I'm leaving!

73
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,030
-Don't miss me!
-Just go.

74
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,110
Lord He.

75
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,520
How does it feel to be kicked out by your wife?

76
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,990
Still better than you being rejected by Her Highness, Mr. Gu.

77
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,070
Your skill at annoying people with your words

78
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,710
is truly masterful.

79
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,909
It's a natural talent.

80
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,640
No need to be envious.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,230
Indeed annoying.

82
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,270
But I still have to thank you for today.

83
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,990
How about we go for a drink?

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,120
Let's go.

85
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,040
That damn Gu Shaozhen.

86
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,190
Ruining my plans again.

87
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,150
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

88
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,410
I promise to help you win He Yunxing over.

89
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,960
He Yunxing is so nice to you.

90
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,870
You really don't like him at all?

91
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,590
Why would I care?

92
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,500
You haven't seen him

93
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,660
being overbearing,

94
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,770
self-righteous,

95
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,840
and arrogant.

96
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,950
Alright, alright.

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,990
Fine, I believe you, okay?

98
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,430
So what should we do next?

99
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,510
How about this?

100
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,400
Do you know how I've lived these years?

101
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,560
I don't really want to know.

102
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,350
Then let me tell you.

103
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,260
For Changning,

104
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,040
I've been through hell and high water.

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,780
Let me tell you.

106
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,820
Oh my.

107
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,040
The two of us

108
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,070
should drink for a while longer.

109
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,950
But,

110
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,110
you know what?

111
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,580
My feelings for Changning are sincere,

112
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,270
but you're the only one she can see.

113
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,070
I am the heir of the prestigious Marquis of Anguo.

114
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,130
How am I inferior to you, a workaholic?

115
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,590
If I have to say,

116
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,230
there are two things.

117
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,550
Which two things?

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,190
This thing,

119
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,420
and that thing.

120
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,440
You're messing with me.

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,990
Forget it, I don't care.

122
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,810
He Yunxing.

123
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,790
As long as you don't compete with me for Changning,

124
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,390
we can be friends.

125
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,630
Ah, no.

126
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,010
No, no, no, no.

127
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,550
Let's be brothers.

128
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,990
Does Changning have anything to do with me?

129
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,920
No.

130
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,310
But you.

131
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,350
If you really like her,

132
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,690
just confess your love to her.

133
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,950
Right.

134
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,790
I've never confessed my love to her before.

135
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,790
Alright then. Tomorrow.

136
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,350
I'll confess my love to her tomorrow.

137
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,800
I'll do it tomorrow.

138
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,710
You keep drinking.

139
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,490
I'm going to bed first.

140
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,280
Changning.

141
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,430
A little more over here.

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,610
Changning, what are you doing?

143
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,110
Don't talk to me.

144
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,830
Don't ruin my plans.

145
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,420
Come here.

146
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,100
Why are you standing there?

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
I've always been by your side.
