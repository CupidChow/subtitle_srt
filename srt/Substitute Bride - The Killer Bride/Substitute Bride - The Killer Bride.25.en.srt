00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,930
[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,950
[Episode 25]

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,990
Mr. Gu, you were in danger the day before yesterday

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,370
and fell off a cliff.

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,670
I arrived too late.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,549
I hope you can forgive me.

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,280
Master Mao, you are observant.

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,710
I specially arranged this banquet for you

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,230
because of that.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,570
Thank you, Master Mao.

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,230
What do you mean by that?

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,850
For He Yunxing and his wife,

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,270
I've done everything I could.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,350
But what did I get in return?

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,140
He Yunxing left me behind.

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,110
Si Yueyao actually tried to kill me.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,230
Only you, Master Mao,

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,290
personally led people to look for me.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,350
Through that incident,

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,430
I realized something.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,400
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,430
Only you, Master Mao,

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,630
deserve to be my good friend.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,770
Oh my God!

25
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:12,350
Mr. Gu, I'm flattered.

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,550
Please.

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,430
Because of Si Yueyao's identity,

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,789
He Yunxing's reputation and career

29
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,670
will be ruined.

30
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,039
But you, Master Mao, are different.

31
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,830
You are His Majesty's trusted subordinate

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,350
and are very capable.

33
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,710
All these years, He Yunxing has failed to eliminate Sui Feng.

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,420
You've only been here for less than three days,

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,090
and you managed to expose Si Yueyao as Sui Feng.

36
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,479
The difference is obvious.

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,910
I admire you.

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,070
Really.

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,360
Mr. Gu,

40
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,259
I'm flattered.

41
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,570
Actually,

42
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,229
it was all thanks to you.

43
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,790
If it weren't for the secret letter you wrote,

44
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,430
I wouldn't have come to Tingcheng.

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,150
Now that you've mentioned that,

46
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,220
I'm going to be frank with you.

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,230
You and I were both sent by His Majesty to supervise the officials.

48
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,790
We are on the same side.

49
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,710
I hope that after returning to the capital,

50
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,710
you can put in a good word for me in front of His Majesty.

51
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,550
My future promotions and career

52
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,600
depend on you, Master Mao.

53
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,950
Come on.

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,150
Mr. Gu, I'm flattered.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,930
You come from a prestigious and noble family.

56
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,190
In the future,

57
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,910
I'll need to rely on Mansion of Marquis of Anguo.

58
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,410
Master Mao, you just sounded too distant.

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,720
The key of the border defense map is on you.

60
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,460
I'll make you dead drunk.

61
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,830
Master Mao.

62
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,170
We both are smart guys.

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,870
We naturally won't align ourselves with someone like He Yunxing, who has lost power.

64
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,990
Am I right?

65
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,630
Mr. Gu,

66
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,630
you know how to size up the situation at such a young age.

67
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,680
You are

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,190
truly insightful.

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,910
Actually,

70
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,079
being with you

71
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,260
has made me understand what insight means.

72
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,030
It was digging into me.

73
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,710
Look at this little thing.

74
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,430
Looks like I need to make him drink more.

75
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,970
Mr. Gu, feel free to tell me everything.

76
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,720
Just say whatever you want.

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,080
As long as it's within my power,

78
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,110
I'll do my best.

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,950
The older, the wiser.

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,710
Master Mao, you know me well.

81
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,529
Here's the thing.

82
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,269
Changning and I love each other.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,890
But Changning's marriage alliance is His Majesty's order.

84
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,280
I wonder if you have a good solution.

85
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,280
You came to me

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,790
because you want my help.

87
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,550
You're a smart guy.

88
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,310
It's difficult.

89
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,550
People who disobey

90
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,900
His Majesty's orders will be beheaded.

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,310
No, no.

92
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,790
Master Mao, I'm not asking you to risk your life.

93
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,050
A little help from the sidelines will do.

94
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:58,240
After all, your words are of great significance

95
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,030
in His Majesty's heart.

96
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,320
That... won't be easy.

97
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,470
Okay.

98
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,990
I'll just

99
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,150
promise you first.

100
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,350
Master Mao.

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,650
Please.

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,690
Come on.

103
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,430
Master Mao,

104
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,150
I've already drunk all of it.

105
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,430
You should drink all of it too.

106
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,040
I've drunk enough.

107
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,870
No way.

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,870
You must drink all of it.

109
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,470
Come on. Drink.

110
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,210
We're happy today.

111
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,750
Let's have a few more drinks.

112
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,590
Let me refill your cup.

113
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,600
I can't drink more.

114
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,310
You drink more if you can.

115
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,220
Master Mao,

116
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,170
let's continue to drink.

117
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,980
You drink first.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
I'll rest for a while.

119
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,000
Then I'll drink by myself.

120
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,550
Master Mao?

121
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,950
Master Mao,

122
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,790
let's continue to drink. Why are you sleeping?

123
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,590
You think you can outsmart me?

124
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,250
Let's see how much longer you can stay smug, old man.

125
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:09,900
How did it go?

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,610
You got it?

127
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

128
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,930
Mr. Gu, I will

129
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,610
remember your kindness.

130
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,150
But if anything goes wrong,

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,550
our entire families will be beheaded.

132
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,280
Don't worry.

133
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,780
If I fail,

134
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,070
I'll take responsibility on my own.

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,270
I told you I'd treat you like my brother.

136
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,309
Since we are brothers, it's not necessary to say that.

137
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,240
I'll leave marks along the way.

138
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,980
You can use the map provided by the secret sentry to rule out the areas,

139
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,780
and you'll surely see the marks left by me.

140
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,510
By that time,

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,060
we'll cooperate with each other

142
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,790
to capture Sui Feng and his men.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,470
If it's necessary,

144
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,430
the Shisi Government Office will be at your command.

145
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,680
[Commander]

146
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,590
Okay.

147
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,120
One more thing.

148
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,610
There's a box under the bed in my room.

149
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,980
It contains the assets of the He family.

150
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,670
If I can't come back,

151
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,910
help me convert the banknotes, title deeds,

152
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,180
and assets into cash

153
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,560
and give it to General Si

154
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,110
as the military funding.

155
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,650
Are you...

156
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,710
saying your last words?
