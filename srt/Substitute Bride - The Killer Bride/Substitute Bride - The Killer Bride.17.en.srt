00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,820
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,860
Man'er is currently in a state of confusion.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,390
We should call for a doctor.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,660
Someone come here!

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,660
Call for a doctor!

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,410
That won't be necessary.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,560
Master Mao?

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,510
I think she can identify people quite clearly.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,270
I'm afraid it's you, He Yunxing, who's confused.

[Royal edict]

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,940
I have received His Majesty's orders

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,740
[Royal edict]

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,130
to investigate the case of Daqiu spies.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,020
Starting from today,

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,050
the Shisi Government Office,

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,670
and all levels of government offices in Tingcheng

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,480
must obey my commands.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,610
[Royal edict]

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,480
Receive the imperial edict.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,180
Who is this person?

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,670
Master Mao.

23
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,230
Master Mao is my grandfather's confidant.

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,770
He has always disliked He Yunxing, the newly favored courtier.

25
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,819
The two are at odds with each other.

26
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,150
Their grudge runs deep.

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,039
There's indeed no need for explanation now.

28
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,350
He won't listen to any explanation anyway.

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,130
Master Mao,

30
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,670
please follow me to the council hall.

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,090
I will personally report the case details.

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,350
There's no rush for this matter.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,630
Guards!

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,120
Detain Si Yueyao for questioning.

35
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,750
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,310
Stop!

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,770
Master Mao.

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,740
Si Yueyao

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,910
is my wife.

40
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,500
I'd like to see who dares.

41
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,390
Lord He,

42
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,860
now you must also obey my orders.

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,360
I must advise you,

44
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,390
in all matters,

45
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,770
prioritize the bigger picture.

46
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,650
Master Mao.

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,030
Yueyao is after all the wife of the Shisi Government Office Commander

48
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,790
and the daughter of a border general.

49
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,790
How can she be imprisoned so easily?

50
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,620
Why don't we temporarily confine Yueyao in the east wing room?

51
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,710
What do you think?

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,280
I think

53
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,570
Princess Changning's words are most appropriate.

54
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,430
Let's keep her under supervision first.

55
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,360
When the witness wakes up

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,690
and we obtain evidence, it won't be too late to imprison her.

57
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,020
In case there's no evidence later,

58
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,829
He Yunxing might accuse you of deliberately framing his wife.

59
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,200
Wouldn't that give others leverage against you?

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Isn't that right?

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,360
Your Highness is wise.

62
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,970
Guards!

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,350
Take Si Yueyao to the east wing room and guard her well.

64
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,810
Without my order,

65
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,580
no one is allowed to visit her.

66
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,280
-Yes!
-Yes!

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
It's alright.

68
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,250
Once Man'er wakes up,

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,800
everything will be clear.

70
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,650
I'll be fine.

71
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,750
Master Mao, is there anything else?

72
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,730
I have brought an imperial verbal edict for Your Highness.

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,930
Please come with me.

74
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,070
Verbal edict?

75
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,280
His Majesty decrees,

76
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,950
Princess Changning is to marry the crown prince of Lu State.

77
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,110
The journey will begin in one month.

78
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,820
Your Highness, please receive the edict.

79
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,890
Qing State has been at war with Daqiu for many years,

80
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,500
suffering heavy losses.

81
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,909
His Majesty hopes that Your Highness's marriage to the crown prince of Lu State

82
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,070
will secure military assistance from Lu State.

83
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,659
This is also a necessary measure.

84
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,780
Royal children are born to serve the country loyally.

85
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,860
Your Highness, you should understand this principle.

86
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,220
I disagree.

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,370
Mr. Gu, do you intend to disobey the imperial edict?

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,620
There're countless men in Qing State.

89
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,250
Now we are going to sacrifice a woman for the country's stability.

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,360
It's ridiculous.

91
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,230
This is His Majesty's decree.

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,390
Mr. Gu, are you planning to rebel?

93
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,390
Even if I am...

94
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,250
Gu Shaozhen,

95
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,460
shut your mouth.

96
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,909
Changning.

97
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,830
I, Changning,

98
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,630
accept the decree and thank His Majesty.

99
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,870
Alright, alright.

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,430
Your Highness is doing the right thing.

101
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,370
Are you really

102
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,550
going to marry the prince of Lu State?

103
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,190
I can't watch you risk your life by defying the order.

104
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,330
So what if I defy the order and take risks?

105
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,310
What does it matter even if I die?

106
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,640
No, no, no!

107
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,820
I can't watch the person I like go to his death.

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,150
What did you say?

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,990
I said...

110
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,310
I said...

111
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,600
I said I like you.

112
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,000
Gu Shaozhen.

113
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,010
I like you too.

114
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,710
What are you doing?

115
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,680
Packing my bags.

116
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,240
I'm going to elope with you.

117
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,870
All under heaven belongs to the emperor.

118
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,410
Where can we run to?

119
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,320
I can't stand by and watch you enter a political marriage.

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,430
Even if it means death,

121
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,360
I can't allow it.

122
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,750
Don't keep talking about death so casually.

123
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,690
Fortunately, we still have time.

124
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,159
Calm down first.

125
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,040
Let's think of another way.

126
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,680
It's all because of that damned Daqiu.

127
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,850
If we could catch Sui Feng

128
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,410
and dismantle Da Qiu's spy network,

129
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,510
allowing Qing State to defeat Daqiu in one fell swoop,

130
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,800
as long as Qing State can gain an absolute advantage,

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,110
the matter of the political marriage

132
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,540
should still have room for negotiation.

133
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,340
That's right!

134
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,730
I always said you were the smartest.

135
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,090
No wonder you're the man I, Changning, have fallen for.

136
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,200
Of course.

137
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,750
Sir,

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,260
what are you doing?

139
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,289
Man'er suddenly returned and falsely accused Yueyao.

140
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,500
If it's not hysteria,

141
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,780
someone must be behind this.

142
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,150
I want to wake her up

143
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,770
and get to the bottom of this.

144
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,390
Stop!

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,010
Master Mao,

146
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,790
the night is deep and the dew is heavy.

147
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,030
Why are you here

148
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,440
instead of having a rest?

149
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,770
If I were to rest well,

150
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,060
I'm afraid we might lose a perfectly good witness.

151
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,220
Master Mao, aren't you exaggerating?

152
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,100
It seems this female spy Si Yueyao is quite something,

153
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,870
even the Commander of the Shisi Government Office,

154
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,430
obeys her.

155
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,980
Without evidence,

156
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,770
I urge you

157
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,110
to be careful with your words.
