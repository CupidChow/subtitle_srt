[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,960
[Episode 26]

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,200
Are you...

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,470
saying your last words?

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,190
I won't help you with this kind of thing.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,150
If you want to give him money,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,470
come back and give it to him yourself.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,190
Now is not the time to be sentimental.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,720
I have to be prepared for the worst situation.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,590
Take it.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,030
I'll help you keep it for now.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,710
As for other things, it's up to you.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,910
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,110
Promise me

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,420
you'll bring Yueyao back safely.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,510
I will protect her

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,930
with my own life.

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,900
You should also protect yourself.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,910
Come back alive.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,099
If He Yunxing fails,

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,260
he and Yueyao...

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,750
We will see them again,

23
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,470
right?

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,720
If we can't catch Sui Feng,

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,320
the political marriage will be inevitable.

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,710
By that time...

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,789
By that time,

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,850
even if I risk everything I have,

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,830
I won't let you go for a political marriage.

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,229
How could I possibly let you risk everything you have?

31
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,690
Let's go.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
Let's go back and I'll make you some hangover soup.

33
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,039
Let's go.

34
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,150
Mr. Gu,

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,030
Commander He's secret sentry delivered this.

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,670
The secret sentry said

37
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,430
Sui Feng could be

38
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,560
in the areas marked on it.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,930
Okay.

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,530
Mobilize our men

41
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,630
and assemble them immediately.

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,380
Then go with me.

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,910
Yes.

44
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,430
Changning.

45
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,470
Any clue?

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,470
The direction of Nanshan.

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,310
We... are about to leave soon.

48
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,630
Okay.

49
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,350
Drink this first.

50
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,360
It's really good.

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,420
Alright,

52
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,030
don't worry about me.

53
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,710
I'll come back safely.

54
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,650
I'll wait for you to come back.

55
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,950
Mr. Gu,

56
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,180
our men have been assembled.

57
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,300
We can set out now.

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,910
I'm leaving.

59
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,450
Don't worry.

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,230
I'll come back safely.

61
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,730
Wait for me.

62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,470
Where's the border defense map?

63
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,650
I don't know.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,820
Gu Shaozhen made me drunk first,

65
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,910
then He Yunxing and the border defense map disappeared together.

66
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,430
I fell into his trap.

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,360
It must be He Yunxing, that jerk!

68
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,720
Issue an arrest warrant immediately.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,320
Whoever captures He Yunxing

70
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,630
will be rewarded with 100 taels of gold.

71
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,630
Yes, sir!

72
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,910
Master Mao,

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
the matter hasn't been thoroughly investigated yet.

74
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,240
It's not proper

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,750
to jump to conclusions

76
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,909
and convict He Yunxing, right?

77
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,630
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

78
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,610
Shouldn't you be preparing for the political marriage?

79
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,070
You...

80
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,810
No wonder Gu Shaozhen suddenly asked me to drink with him.

81
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,390
I'm afraid the border defense map's disappearance

82
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,950
has something to do with him too.

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,410
I will report

84
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,460
everything in detail to His Majesty.

85
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,190
Lord He, we meet again.

86
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,550
I've brought the border defense map.

87
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,800
Take me to Sui Feng.

88
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,480
If you want to see Lord Sui Feng,

89
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,070
please follow our rules, Lord He.

90
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,870
Lord He, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,250
Lord Sui Feng,

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,610
He Yunxing has arrived.

93
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,790
Lord He, how have you been?

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,360
Doctor Huo,

95
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,040
it's really you.

96
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,750
With this real map,

97
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,390
Daqiu can severely damage Qing State.

98
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,630
Deliver the map to Daqiu.

99
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,340
Yes.

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,960
Where's Yueyao?

101
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,030
Yueyao.

102
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,390
Yueyao!

103
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,970
You used the soul-controlling incense on Yueyao!

104
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,730
I had to use the soul-controlling incense on her

105
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,800
to make her obey.

106
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,730
You despicable person!

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,350
Despite our prolonged open and covert battles,

108
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,890
I was always unable to find your weakness.

109
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,550
When I saw you in Heyue Restaurant that time,

110
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,670
I knew

111
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,360
you would betray your country

112
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,510
for Si Yueyao.

113
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,870
You disguised yourself so well.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,090
Lord He, I'm flattered.

115
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,230
We... are not so different.

116
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,590
We just serve different emperors.

117
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,870
I've given you the border defense map.

118
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,070
Release Yueyao.

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,190
[Arrest warrant]

120
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,070
You're now a traitor despised by everyone.

121
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,310
You can't return to Qing State anymore.

122
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,140
[Arrest warrant]

123
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,340
Why don't you surrender to Daqiu?

124
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,270
I promise you'll have a high position and great wealth.

125
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,870
You and Yueyao can live well in Daqiu.

126
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,310
Listen,

127
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,220
even if I die,

128
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,070
I will never surrender to Daqiu!

129
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,130
A country like Qing State doesn't deserve your loyalty.

130
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,290
It's not up to you!

131
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,250
You really are stubborn.

132
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,200
Fine.

133
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,120
Let Yueyao have a chat with you.

134
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,290
Since you won't surrender to Daqiu,

135
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,590
taste what it's like to be flayed alive by your loved one.

136
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,620
Yueyao,

137
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,240
kill him.

138
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,750
Yueyao.

139
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,150
Yueyao.

140
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,230
Yueyao!

141
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,390
Yueyao!

142
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,190
Nothing over there either?

143
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,980
No.

144
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,140
What about here?

145
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,430
Go over there and keep looking.

146
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,880
Yes.

147
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,020
Mr. Gu,

148
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,180
we've found traces of Lord He.

149
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,970
Good!

150
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,740
Close in on them!

151
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,630
-Yes!
-Yes!

152
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,670
Yueyao,

153
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,670
calm down!

154
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,930
I'm Yunxing.

155
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,890
Yueyao!

156
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,970
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

157
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,570
God bless us.

158
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,710
I hope when Grandpa receives the letter,

159
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,980
he can distinguish between right and wrong.
