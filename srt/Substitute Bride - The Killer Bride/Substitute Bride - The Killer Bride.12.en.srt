[Episode 12]

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,110
Mother,

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,390
you really are a spy for Daqiu.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,680
Si Cheng?

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,750
My real father

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,310
is General Si?

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,400
Yao, what's wrong?

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,390
General Si?

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,630
Yao,

11
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,920
it seems that this

12
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,430
was all destined from fate.

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,630
Your mother has been watching over you,

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,150
which is why you can be reunited with your father.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,160
But...

16
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,830
how am I supposed to tell Father?

17
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,850
Right now,

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,590
the situation at the frontline is still tense.

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,870
Let's wait for Dad to come back first.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,950
Alright.

21
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,150
Sir, bad news.

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,430
Xu Yun'er is missing.

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,110
When did Xu Yun'er go missing?

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,310
The kitchen sent food once last night,

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,270
and the doctor also brought her medicine once.

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,130
The guard said

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,070
Xu Yun'er was in her room the whole time last night.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,220
He saw her through the window.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,710
But this morning, when he came to deliver food,

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,240
he found Xu Yun'er was gone.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,810
Xu Yun'er is injured.

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,030
She will definitely leave behind some traces.

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,870
There.

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,110
The Storm Pear Blossom Needles?

35
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,430
That.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,160
Give me that.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,780
The box for the border defense map?

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,310
This Xu Yun'er, even while injured,

39
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,650
not only killed the guard

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,510
but also managed to take the border defense map.

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,610
This spy

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,190
is truly impressive.

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,040
In fact, the one who's impressive is our Lord.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,570
Xu Yun'er was deliberately let go by our Lord.

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,470
The border defense map is fake.

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,829
I'm going to lure the snake out of its hole.

47
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,890
So what do we do now?

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,550
Jiu Feng,

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,320
set up secret sentries.

50
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,150
If there's any sign of Xu Yun'er,

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,220
report to me immediately.

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,740
Yes.

53
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,150
Lord Sui Feng.

54
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,300
Where is the border defense map?

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,630
I didn't get the border defense map.

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,590
Please forgive me.

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,810
I will investigate thoroughly as soon as possible

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,870
and retrieve the border defense map.

60
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,940
If you fail to get the map,

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,470
you know what the consequences will be.

62
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,270
Yes.

[General's Mansion]

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,720
All packed up?

65
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,240
Since we are here at the frontier,

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,680
we should enjoy ourselves thoroughly before heading back to the capital.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,370
Changning,

68
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,829
do you have any wishes?

69
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
I want...

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,030
I want to taste all the delicacies of Tingcheng

71
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,680
and see all the scenery of the frontier.

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,880
Alright, no problem.

73
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,690
Leave it to me.

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700
I'll arrange everything tomorrow.

75
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,710
Changning, Mr. Gu.

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,320
What are you doing?

77
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,460
Yueyao, have a seat.

78
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,670
I was just about to tell you.

79
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm moving out now.

80
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,560
I've stayed here for so long.

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
It's time for me to make room for He Yunxing.

82
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,560
Why?

83
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,170
Are you still mad at me?

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,790
How could I, a noble princess,

85
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,910
be angry with you?

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,830
I've already moved on.

87
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,560
Changning,

88
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,600
about what happened before,

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,630
it was my fault.

90
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,470
This jade pendant looks like it's made with Daqiu craftsmanship.

91
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,870
I will certainly do it without hesitation.

92
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,140
You two sisters don't need to be so formal.

93
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,310
If Changning says she has moved on, then she surely has.

94
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,020
Let's talk about something lighter.

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,680
Yueyao.

96
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,550
The craftsmanship of your jade pendant is quite exquisite.

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Was it a gift from He Yunxing?

98
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,020
No.

99
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,909
It's a keepsake my mother left me.

100
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,550
Yueyao,

101
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,150
you poor thing.

102
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,870
You lost both your parents when you were young

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,430
and were left all alone.

104
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,710
Don't worry,

105
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll treat you better from now on.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,440
But now I have He Yunxing,

107

108
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,580

I'm already very happy and content.

110

Oh, by the way, Yueyao,

111
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,970
we're going out for some delicious food tomorrow.

112
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,820
Would you like to join us?

113
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,340
She's always inseparable from He Yunxing.

114
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,710
Let's not get in the way.

115
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,840
Why don't we

116
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,470
just bring some food back for Yueyao?

117
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,350
How about that?

118
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:37,830
What do you think?

119
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,630
Yes, yes, yes.

120
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,510
That's right.

121
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,510
I have something to do tomorrow.

122
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,440
You two go ahead.

123
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,620
Yes.

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,510
Well then,

125
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,630
let's head back now

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,010
and not disturb Yueyao's rest any longer.

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,380
Alright then.

128
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,909
Yueyao, rest early.

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,630
There's one more here.

130
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,360
Give it to me.

00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,150

[Entry and Exit]

136
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,370
Have you noticed anything suspicious?

137
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,420
That day, after Xu Yun'er met with Doctor Huo,

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,130
she suddenly changed her story

139
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,730
and claimed to be Sui Feng.

140
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,150
Don't you think there's something suspicious

141
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,940
about that?

142
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
And when he was massaging Xu Yun'er,

143
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,110
his technique was very strange,

144
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,720
as if he was telling her something.

145
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,230
Are you suspecting that Doctor Huo is Xu Yun'er's superior, Sui Feng?

146
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,490
It's just a suspicion.

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,400
Let's focus on ourselves.

191
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,530
Don't disturb them.

192
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,550
Keep enjoying the music.

193
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,640
I heard the border defense map of Qing State is in your hands.

194
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,570
That's right.

195
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,960
The border defense map is with me.

196
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,450
But this border defense map is a highly sought-after item,

197
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,800
so the price

198
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,790
naturally won't be low.

199
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,690
Is this enough?

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,890
Where's the map?

201
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,920
It's you?

202
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,360
Who are you?

203
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,590
It's you!

204
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,610
Give me the map.

205
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,570
No!

206
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,640
You value money over your life!

207
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,250
Stop!
