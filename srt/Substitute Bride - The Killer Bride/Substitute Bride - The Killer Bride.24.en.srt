[The killer bride]

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,940
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,630
Master Mao, what you said is right.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,790
I will definitely catch Si Yueyao personally

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,810
to vent the hatred in my heart.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,190
Love begets hate.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,090
That's really not necessary.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,990
You should

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,510
have a peaceful state of mind.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,220
You should treat women

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,900
like cats and dogs.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,850
If you don't care,

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,870
you won't get hurt.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,770
Master Mao, your level

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,030
is far beyond what an ordinary person like me can reach.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,540
Master Mao,

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,890
I came here today

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,600
because I... want another favor from you.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
I want to personally lead a troop

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,350
to capture Si Yueyao.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,580
Please grant my wish.

22
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,910
Okay.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,710
I'll give you another chance to redeem yourself.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,950
Thank you, Master Mao.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,230
I will not betray your trust in me.

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,080
Consider this stab...

27
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,200
my repayment to you.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,780
I'm giving this sachet

29
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,000
back to you!

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,789
From now on,

31
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,690
we'll go our separate ways

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,810
and we are even.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,350
I wonder how Yunxing is doing.

34
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,950
Do you still remember your sachet?

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,810
He has always carried it with him.

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,940
What medicine did Yunxing give me?

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,070
Astragalus membranaceus, radix paeoniae alba, medicinal cyathula root, and fish maw.

38
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,630
I see.

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,930
Eat.

40
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,390
When will you take me to Sui Feng?

41
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,840
How could this happen?

42
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,510
Sir.

43
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,160
Sir, please let me go.

44
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,230
Or I really won't be able to survive.

45
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,960
You want to go to Sui Feng for the antidote, right?

46
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,950
Yueyao has always wanted to detoxify you,

47
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,600
but you framed her.

48
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,530
There is no cure

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,560
for the poison in your body.

50
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,420
That's not possible.

51
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,680
They promised me

52
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,270
if I went to them for the antidote within ten days,

53
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,070
I could live.

54
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,390
You should know

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,530
how Master Liu in the western suburb

56
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,430
and Madam Feng on South Street

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,270
died

58
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,070
since you're so well-informed.

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,070
I heard they died of a strange disease.

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,920
But what does that have to do with me?

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,829
The Shisi Government Office has already confirmed

62
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,070
they were informants of Daqiu's spies.

63
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,150
When they were no longer useful,

64
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,930
they both died mysteriously.

65
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,970
Their symptoms are exactly the same as yours.

66
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,870
Impossible.

67
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,640
Xu Yun'er is a bitch.

68
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,670
She lied to me.

69
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,800
I don't want to die.

70
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,470
I haven't been freed from my slave status.

71
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,600
I haven't got married or had children.

72
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,770
I don't want to die.

73
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,850
Sir.

74
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,910
Sir, please save me.

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,830
Yueyao left a prescription,

76
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,510
which can delay the onset of the poison

77
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,710
and extend your life.

78
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,050
If you meet a miracle-working doctor

79
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,230
during this period,

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,190
you might have a slim chance of survival.

81
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,670
Sir,

82
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,320
I'll tell you everything

83
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,140
as long as I can stay alive.

84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
Tell me then.

85
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,320
Xu Yun'er and Sui Feng

86
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,440
asked me to frame Si Yueyao.

87
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,210
They said it could bring you and General Si down.

88
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,250
And Qing State's border would be left defenseless.

89
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,630
Then Daqiu could seize the chance to capture the cities along the border.

90
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,870
You are aware of the stakes,

91
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,210
yet you still let them manipulate you.

92
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,910
Sir,

93
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,250
I'm just an ordinary person.

94
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,230
I just wanted to stay alive.

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,510
Continue.

96
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,430
The person who kidnapped me in Heyue Restaurant

97
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,950
was Sui Feng you've been looking for.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,710
You saw Sui Feng's face?

99
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,110
His face was always covered.

100
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,270
I didn't see his face.

101
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,210
But I know one of his characteristics.

102
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,240
He has congenital uneven legs.

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,310
Also,

104
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,250
I think Sui Feng must know Yueyao very well.

105
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,710
That's why he could easily make others believe she's Sui Feng.

106
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,640
Uneven legs?

107
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,920
And knowing Yueyao well?

108
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,659
[General's Mansion]

109
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,580
Doctor Huo.

110
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,590
Lord Sui Feng.

111
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,390
Yueyao, we meet again.

112
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,550
Doctor Huo?

113
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,970
I didn't expect

114
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,800
you to be Sui Feng.

115
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,640
No.

116
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,860
Lord Sui Feng.

117
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,110
Get up.

118
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,190
You're still so impulsive.

119
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,040
You asked Man'er to frame me.

120
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,070
Everything was designed by you!

121
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,290
You're getting smarter and smarter.

122
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,550
I'm going to kill you!

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,600
I knew you didn't surrender sincerely.

124
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,890
Your martial arts skills are still so poor.

125
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,780
Your mother

126
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,450
was far better than you.

127
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,570
Sir,

128
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,130
how should we deal with her?

129
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,670
Lock her up.

130
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,790
She's still very useful.

131
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,350
This is the plant Man'er said

133
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,810
she saw at the place where she lived

134
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,790
after Sui Feng took her.

135
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,560
If we find where this plant is,

136
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,890
we can locate Sui Feng.

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Ask our secret sentries to map all the areas near Tingcheng

138
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,390
where this type of plant grows.

139
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,670
If I'm not here,

140
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,680
give it to Gu Shaozhen.

141
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,820
Yes, sir.

142
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,870
[General's Mansion]

143
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,430
That's roughly how things unfolded.

144
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,400
Sui Feng hid it so well.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,300
How despicable!

146
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
It's all my fault.

147
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,850
I jumped to conclusions quickly.

148
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,230
I wrote a secret letter to His Majesty,

149
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,630
who sent Master Mao here.

150
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,490
Otherwise,

151
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,870
there wouldn't have been so much trouble.

152
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,870
It's all my fault.

153
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,490
Spies are cunning.

154
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,070
Framing others is a common tactic of theirs.

155
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,930
You don't need to blame yourself.

156
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,550
Sir,

157
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,310
a child just delivered a letter

158
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,590
and said it's for you.

159
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,510
He Yunxing,

160
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,190
Si Yueyao is in my hands.

161
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,220
If you want to save her,

162
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,110
trade the real border defense map for her.

163
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,020
Sui Feng is truly despicable.

164
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,930
He wants you to trade the border defense map for Yueyao's life.

165
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,850
He Yunxing,

166
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,700
Sui Feng is cunning and treacherous.

167
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,530
Saving her is the priority.

168
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,670
We'll go with you.

169
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,440
No.

170
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,570
I'll go alone.

171
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,340
I can't let anything happen to Yueyao.

172
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,270
But the border defense map is in Master Mao's hands now.

173
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,430
Mr. Gu,

174
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,260
I need your help.

175
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,350
No problem.

176
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,110
I still owe Yueyao a favor.

177
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,290
This is the plan.
