[The killer bride]

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,960
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,020
Yueyao?

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,020
Yueyao!

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,390
Yueyao!

6
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,610
Yueyao.

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,180
Mr. Gu.

8
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,030
Long time no see.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,390
Why is it you?

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,990
You know what?

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,670
The officers and soldiers will be here in no time.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,280
I advise you to release me now.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,360
You mean those idiots led by Master Mao?

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,150
I tricked them easily,

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,790
and now they're wandering aimlessly on another hill.

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,989
You...

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,660
Yueyao?

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,230
Yueyao.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,070
Save me.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,070
Please save me.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,830
When He Yunxing tried to kill me,

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,970
why didn't you say,

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,030
'save me'?

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,150
It was all because of Master Mao's coercion.

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,070
He Yunxing has always loved you.

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,490
How could you misunderstand him like this?

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,310
Do you remember your sachet?

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,680
He's been carrying it with him all along.

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,420
Why waste words on him?

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,520
Yueyao.

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,190
Our people will be here soon.

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,390
Cut his tendons now

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,570
so he can't move.

34
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,590
Are you really going to do that,

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,110
Yueyao?

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,270
We're friends, aren't we?

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,190
Do it.

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,820
There are people coming.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,600
You're right.

40
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,750
Since we're friends,

41
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,950
let's play something fun.

42
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,270
This poison amplifies pain sensation.

43
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,750
This way, when your tendons are cut,

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,860
you can experience ten times the pain.

45
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,310
You...

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
Si Yueyao.

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,510
You vicious woman.

48
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,450
You'll come to no good, just like your mother!

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,579
Why did you take the liberty of doing that?

50
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,310
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

51
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,170
If he hadn't mentioned my mother,

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,460
I might have spared his miserable life.

53
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,890
Was the sachet Gu Shaozhen mentioned

54
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,270
the one He Yunxing gave you just now?

55
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,930
You mean this?

56
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,329
To me,

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,840
it's already absolutely meaningless.

58
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,080
Gu Shaozhen.

59
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,660
Gu Shaozhen!

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,340
Wake up, Gu Shaozhen!

61
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,120
Gu Shaozhen, you're awake.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,380
Changning.

63
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,829
I'm not dead?

64
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,710
Of course you're not dead.

65
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,790
We looked for you for a long time

66
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,970
until we saw this at the edge of the cliff

67
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,120
and found you hanging on a tree.

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,660
You can enjoy

69
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,470
ten times the pain.

70
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,490
You...

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,860
Enrage me.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
Si Yueyao.

73
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,910
You vicious woman.

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,010
You'll come to no good, just like your mother!

75
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,590
It must be because Yueyao feared I'd be caught by the spies

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,110
that she deliberately pushed me onto that tree

77
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,360
and left the sachet as a marker for you.

78
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,350
You were scratched all over by branches.

79
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,870
It must be very painful.

80
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,740
I don't feel any pain at all.

81
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,920
It must be because of the pill Yueyao gave me.

82
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,550
Yueyao saved you.

83
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,030
But what about her?

84
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,390
How should we save her?

85
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,230
Where's He Yunxing?

86
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,030
How's he doing?

87
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,810
Let's go see him first.

88
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,310
Okay.

89
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,440
[General's Mansion]

90
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,080
He Yunxing.

91
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,380
How's your injury?

92
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,770
It's been bandaged. I'm okay.

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,310
What about Yueyao?

94
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,350
Is she hurt?

95
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,750
She's alright.

96
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,550
She's with Xu Yun'er now.

97
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,710
I know.

98
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,150
Did you deliver the message

99
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,990
I asked you to?

100
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,080
You can trust me to get things done.

101
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,760
Do you remember your sachet?

102
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,020
He's been carrying it with him all along.

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,810
But will Yueyao understand what you mean?

104
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,230
She'll definitely understand.

105
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,230
He Yunxing.

106
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,070
Why did Yueyao try to kill you?

107
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,970
Xu Yun'er wants to coax Yueyao into defecting to Daqiu.

108
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,150
Assassinating me

109
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,150
was probably Yueyao's way of proving her loyalty.

110
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,470
Yueyao wanted to use this opportunity to get close to Sui Feng,

111
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,620
so as to avenge her mother.

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,650
Then isn't it like Yueyao's entering the tiger's cave alone?

113
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,610
It's very dangerous.

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,220
Yes.

115
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,430
So,

116
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,190
we need to find her as soon as possible.

117
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,050
Where should we go to look for her?

118
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,070
Sir.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,310
There's still no news

120
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,070
on Her Ladyship's whereabouts.

121
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,880
Send more people.

122
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,810
Keep searching.

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,560
What's wrong?

124
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,750
If you have something to say, just go ahead.

125
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,120
Master Mao has ordered

126
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,470
that all actions of the Shisi Government Office

127
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,370
must be approved by him.

128
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,640
As of now,

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,650
there's no one else we could use.

130
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,670
My father also sent someone to deliver a secret message,

131
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,200
saying that Master Mao has submitted a memorial to His Majesty,

132
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,060
suggesting to reduce General Si's military power.

133
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,470
That damn Master Mao.

134
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,210
Gu Shaozhen.

135
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,910
Aren't you usually full of clever ideas?

136
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,740
Why don't you have any ideas now?

137
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,280
I do have a good idea to pull the rug from under their feet.

138
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,680
Say it.

139
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,540
Find someone to disguise as a Daqiu citizen

140
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,659
and assassinate the prince of the Lu State.

141
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,610
What kind of bad idea is that?

142
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,430
Let alone whether it would work or not,

143
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,490
even if it did,

144
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,380
could Yueyao survive until then?

145
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,909
Tch.

146
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,470
He Yunxing, what idea do you have?

147
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,030
Master Mao.

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,610
I've come specifically to express my gratitude.

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,230
Yesterday, you put aside our past grievances

150
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,870
and saved my life from that vicious woman.

151
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,990
I, He,

152
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,920
am deeply grateful.

153
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,950
There's no need to thank me.

154
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,890
Lord He, you resorted to fraudulence to let Si Yueyao escape,

155
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,790
and then used cremation to destroy the evidence.

156
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,350
And today, you came here

157
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,750
with false intentions of reconciliation.

158
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,980
Do you think

159
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,380
I would fall for that again?

160
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,290
Master Mao.

161
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,350
It was a huge misunderstanding.

162
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,950
Before, I was just-

163
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,510
Don't bother explaining.

164
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,360
No matter what you say,

165
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,070
I won't let Si Yueyao off the hook.

166
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,630
Not only will you not spare her, Master Mao,

167
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,030
I won't let her go either.

168
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,560
I was confused before,

169
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,670
blinded by that vicious woman.

170
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,470
It wasn't until she stabbed me yesterday

171
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,400
that I finally saw her true colors.

172
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,890
Alas.

173
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,230
Look at you.

174
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,910
The chief commander of Shisi Government Office

175
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,150
actually got all battered and bruised by a female spy.

176
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,070
You

177
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,350
are still too young and naïve.

178
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,580
As the ancient saying goes,

179
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,789
deep love leads to a short life,

180
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,380
and extreme wisdom leads to injury.

181
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,240
Master Mao, what you said is very true.

182
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,230
I will capture Si Yueyao myself

183
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,250
to vent the hatred in my heart.

184
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,500
Hatred caused by love

185
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,430
is unnecessary.

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,330
Your state of mind

187
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,880
should be more peaceful.

188
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,700
When it comes to women,

189
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,350
you should treat them like cats and dogs.

190
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,190
If you don't care,

191
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,310
you won't get hurt.

192
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,230
Master Mao, your level of enlightenment

193
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,470
is beyond the reach of an ordinary person like me.

194
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,990
Master Mao.

195
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,360
Actually, I came here today

196
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,030
because I have another request.

197
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,390
I want to personally lead the troops

198
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,620
to capture Si Yueyao.

199
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,610
I hope you will grant me this favor, Master Mao.

200
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,350
Alright then.

201
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,100
I'll give you another chance to redeem yourself.

202
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,390
Thank you, Master Mao.

203
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,670
I won't let you down, Master Mao.
