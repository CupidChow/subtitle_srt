Case reenactment.

4
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,990
According to Qiao Niang,

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,870
that night, she was asked to serve tea in the study.

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,390
Serve tea.

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,830
You!

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,350
We're in the middle of an act.

9
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,350
I'm so scared!

10
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,910
Don't come any closer!

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,840
You almost scared me to death.

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,370
Don't.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,660
Don't come any closer!

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,590
Keep struggling.

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,240
Don't get distracted.

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,080
The hairpin.

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,250
Don't!

18
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:15,789
Don't! Don't!

19
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:16,880
Don't come closer!

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,920
Don't...

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,960
I...

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,900
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,720
I didn't mean to do that.

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,150
You.

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,910
This is the first time I've had such an unprofessional partner.

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,759
Do you do this kind of thing with others a lot?

27
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,830
What? Are you jealous?

28
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,450
Of course not.

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,160
I was just asking.

30
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,550
Don't worry.

31
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,539
I only did this kind of thing

32
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,270
with Jiu Feng and the others.

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,950
I don't care at all.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,820
Go on. It's not over yet.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,960
Wait... Wait a moment.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,750
In this position,

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,579
it's very hard to exert force.

38
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,720
How could she have killed him this way?

39
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,260
I see.

40
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,110
What's with this?

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,010
It seems this wound is actually two wounds,

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,790
one deep and one shallow.

43
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,570
The shallow wound

44
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,130
was caused by the hairpin,

45
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,829
while the wide and deep wound

46
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,750
was caused by Uncle gouging himself.

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,510
The real culprit must have used this wound

48
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,900
to frame Qiao Niang for the murder.

49
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,300
I consulted the ancient texts

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,370
and found that excessive inhalation of soul-controlling incense

51
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,070
can drive a person insane.

52
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,910
Uncle must have been in a state of madness

53
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,440
when he inflicted the fatal wound on himself.

54
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,200
So you're saying,

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,950
the real culprit used the wound left by Qiao Niang

56
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,190
and made it look like a fatal wound

57
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,480
to cover up the fact that Uncle had been poisoned by soul-controlling incense.

58
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
That's right.

59
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,480
It seems the murderer has been hiding in the General's Mansion all along.

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,430
As long as we find the person who has the soul-controlling incense,

61
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,290
that person must be the murderer.

[Wine]

63
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,580
The bandage is loose?

64
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,870
Let me help you rebandage it.

65
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,790
Done.

66
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,590
You've been busy all day.

67
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,310
You must be...

68
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,360
You must be quite tired, right?

69
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,340
Do you want to take a nap?

70
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
How can I sleep in a carriage?

71
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,100
There's nothing to lean on.

72
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,250
You can lean on me.

73
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,350
Thank you.

75
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,000

[General's Mansion]

77
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,380
Sir!

78
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,270
Sir!

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sir, something terrible happened.

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,530
Go ahead.

81
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,280
Qiao Niang committed suicide.

82
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,720
Smell this.

83
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,810
This is soul-controlling incense.

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,710
Sir.

85
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,990
This is Qiao Niang's confession letter.

86
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,570
There are no signs of homicide.

87
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,950
Qiao Niang hadn't left her room either.

88
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,950
She had been resting in her room the whole time.

89
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,740
"I was the one who used the soul-controlling incense to knock out He Yong

90
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,520
and killed him with a hairpin."

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,070
Just as we were about to investigate who has the soul-controlling incense,

92
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,200
Qiao Niang committed suicide with it.

93
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,960
Isn't that a bit too much of a coincidence?

94
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,350
Does this belong to Qiao Niang?

95
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,800
It is hers.

96
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,350
Honey.

97
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,710
It's getting late.

98
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,350
You've had a tiring journey today.

99
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,120
You should go back and rest early.

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,680
Jiu Feng.

101
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,240
Yes, Sir.

102
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,870
Escort her back.

103
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,830
Yes, Sir.

104
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,850
Qiao Niang was a pitiful person.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,410
General lusted for her beauty,

106
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,710
which brought about calamity,

107
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,840
and had himself meet his doom by her hand.

108
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,310
But as a woman myself,

109
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,430
I can understand her to some extent.

110
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,790
May Buddha bless her.

111
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,030
I hope Qiao Niang finds peace in her afterlife soon.

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,230
Aunt.

113
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,430
Ever since Qiao Niang entered the household,

114
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,590
you've been taking good care of her.

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,380
Who would have thought she'd kill Uncle?

116
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,670
And now you're even praying for her.

117
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,110
I truly admire your compassion.

118
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,190
The ill-fated relationship between Qiao Niang and your uncle

119
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,070
was the result of your uncle's doings when he was alive.

120
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,670
Besides, Qiao Niang is already dead.

121
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,950
I just hope that the He family will not face any more misfortunes in the future.

122
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,670
Man'er.

123
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,630
Take these snacks to the altar.

124
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,370
So clumsy!

125
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,070
Aunt.

126
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,990
I've bothered you today.

127
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,470
If there's nothing else,

128
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,990
I'll take my leave now.

129
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,450
Hey. Changning.

130
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,990
What are you doing here?

131
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,200
Yueyao.

132
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,950
I went out to look for you just now,

133
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,550
but I ended up seeing a ghost.

134
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,730
Who's there?
