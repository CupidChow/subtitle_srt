[The killer bride]

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,950
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,450
Why did you ask me to come up here?

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,050
I asked you to...

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,720
I asked you to come to enjoy the flowers.

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,850
Are you alright?

7
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,650
I'm fine.

8
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,170
I just saw Madam Zhao vanish into thin air by the window.

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,490
Let's go.

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,230
He Yunxing.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,180
Where's my heart-fluttering moment?

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,580
Where's my "beauty saves the hero" moment?

13
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,390
That's nice.

14
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,220
A perfect match!

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,310
Strange.

16
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,789
Why is there nothing here?

17
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,120
Are you sure Aunt disappeared here?

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,200
Yes, it must be here.

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,350
What are you doing?

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,750
Aunt.

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,270
We came to visit you.

22
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,009
We didn't expect you to be out.

23
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,550
We apologize for the intrusion.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,150
If you say so.

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm doing very well.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
If there's nothing else,

27
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,430
you should leave.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,690
Sir,

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,880
I just saw a suspicious person moving swiftly across the rooftops,

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,270
coming from our direction.

31
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,530
Have you seen them?

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,910
The suspicious people

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,870
are right in front of me, aren't they?

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,870
We were also concerned about your safety, Aunt.

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,230
Please understand, Aunt.

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,590
There have been many disturbances in the mansion lately.

37
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,150
If you really care,

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,390
then don't disturb my rest.

39
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
If Zhao Qingqing is indeed Sui Feng,

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,579
using the new border defense map as bait

41
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,440
should prompt her to take action.

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,620
Sir,

43
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,390
General Si has sent a message,

44
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,320
requesting to discuss border defense matters at the mansion tonight.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,270
Changning,

46
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,880
don't be angry anymore.

47
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,640
I accidentally

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,460
saw Madam Zhao.

49
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,030
I just accidentally...

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,930
I'm not angry with you.

51
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,740
What I'm upset about is

52
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,070
that they say "when a woman pursues a man, there's only a thin veil between them,"

53
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,270
but it's all nonsense.

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,590
Why is it so difficult?

55
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,870
Maybe for others it's a thin veil,

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,890
but for you, it's

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,880
an iron curtain.

58
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,170
If I can't win him over by tactics,

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,310
then I'll use force.

60
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,990
What's this?

61
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,020
[Hehuan Powder]

62
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,430
Hehuan Powder?

63
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,550
Where did you get it?

64
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,950
I bought it on the street.

65
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,800
The medicine seller said this drug is amazing.

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,430
It can make a man instantly fall for a woman.

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,800
[Hehuan Powder]

68
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
What do you think?

69
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,180
This...

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,680
Isn't… isn't this a bit too forceful?

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,710
So you know what it is, don't you?

72
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,040
I do know.

73
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,270
I'll use it then.

74
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,450
You don't want me to do so?

75
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,880
Are you kidding?

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,040
Of course, I do.

77
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,120
Let's use Hehuan Powder on him.

78
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,209
[General's Mansion]

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,250
Father-in-law, you're indeed far-sighted.

80
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,320
This newly revised border defense map

81
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,090
is truly an excellent border defense strategy.

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
You must keep it safe.

83
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,710
Assign people to guard it closely.

84
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,090
There must not be any mistakes.

85
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,890
Rest assured.

86
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,150
I have matters to attend to in the army.

87
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,350
I'll take my leave now.

88
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,870
Give my regards to Yueyao.

89
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,030
I'll come visit her another day.

90
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,090
Alright, take care, Father-in-law.

91
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,470
Honey.

92
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,220
Why are you being so especially nice to me today?

93
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,710
Don't you like it?

94
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,230
How is it?

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,100
Does it taste good?

96
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,490
Is there more? I'd like another bowl.

97
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,110
Well,

98
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,980
drinking too much isn't good for your health.

99
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,240
You can go back to your work now.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,810
I'll be going now.

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,950
Changning,

102
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,390
Changning!

103
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,540
Who locked the door?

104
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,470
Gu Shaozhen, you're ruining my plans again.

105
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,030
Open the door!

106
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,670
What are you doing?

107
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,150
Open up!

108
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,810
What are you doing?

109
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,110
-Put me down, Gu Shaozhen.
-Open the door!

110
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,900
Put me down!

111
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,320
The time is running out!

112
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,740
Oh no, something's going to happen!

113
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,700
What did you put in there?

114
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,160
I-i-iced pear with rock sugar!

115
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,790
This is the third time you've helped Changning get close to me.

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,230
I...

117
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,630
I...

118
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,720
In your heart,

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,180
is there no place for me at all?

120
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,030
I...

121
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,170
Please calm down.

122
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,030
You're not serious, are you?

123
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,410
How much did you actually put in?

124
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,420
Just a little bit.

125
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,780
What you need to do now is stay as far away from me as possible.

126
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,830
No, I can't.

127
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,400
You'll get into trouble like this.

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,070
It's my fault.

129
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,700
I brought this upon myself.

130
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,950
I...

131
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,500
I absolutely won't leave you alone like this.

132
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,310
Come on.

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,400
Do you know what you're saying?

134
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,910
You...

135
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,110
You...

136
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,059
Why are you bleeding so much?

137
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,360
This dart...

138
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,270
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,000
I found it...

140
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,140
I found it in our wedding chamber.

141
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,679
Don't talk anymore.

142
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,440
Let's stop the bleeding first.

143
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,040
Put me down!

144
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,200
I'll count to three.

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,860
One.

146
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,670
Two.

147
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,710
Three!

148
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,740
You often countdown.

149
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,050
Can't you do anything else?

150
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,280
What are you up to?

151
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,740
You always ruin my plans.

152
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm asking you a question.

153
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,510
Cat got your tongue?

154
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,530
I'm warning you.

155
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,020
Stop following me.

156
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,360
I like you!
