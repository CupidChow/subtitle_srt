1
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,435
Chun Yu Chun Yu, listen to me

2
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,370
You can do it

3
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,304
I trust you

4
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,579
spring rain

5
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,382
let's do it again

6
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:38,758
Mr. Yan

7
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,360
It's time to start the game

8
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,428
No

9
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,297
next level

10
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,298
Need to be remodeled

11
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:46,966
At this time

12
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,101
We can get straight to the point

13
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,137
Let's take a break tonight

14
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:52,872
good

15
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,795
Why

16
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,005
This would be dangerous

17
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:28,908
Actually I used to

18
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,243
Be a member of Micro Technology

19
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,444
Because I can't stand it

20
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,845
what they did

21
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,347
Just resigned and left

22
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,220
But if the secret

23
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,387
Know I'm helping you

24
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,189
I'm in danger

25
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,192
Understood

26
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,961
I'll keep it secret

27
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,031
Important equipment of microtechnology

28
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,000
It should be at device two

29
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,401
receive

30
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,943
Do you know Chun Yiming?

31
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,646
Does he have anything to do with all this?

32
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,484
Didn’t enter the game again last night

33
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:24,524
Yes

34
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,003
Why didn't you get in again?

35
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,406
Xu Wenya

36
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,274
Xu Wenya

37
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,382
wake up quickly

38
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:49,882
wake up quickly

39
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,018
What are you doing?

40
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,624
What are you doing?

41
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,759
Not in the game again

42
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,062
Yes

43
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,198
Why haven't you entered the game again?

44
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,032
no

45
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,368
I've put on my jeans

46
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,402
Why are you not in the game again?

47
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,742
Why

48
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,314
Will it be like last time?

49
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,515
Something went wrong with the system

50
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:23,950
Probably not

51
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,518
They have completed

52
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,352
Our information

53
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,820
that's why

54
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,489
Are you giving us a day off?

55
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,192
Dream on you

56
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,463
They all started yesterday

57
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,498
Following us

58
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,866
It's definitely not that simple

59
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,837
Are you holding back some big move?

60
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,840
no matter what

61
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,075
We still follow what we said yesterday

62
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,043
Business as usual, be careful

63
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:51,911
good

64
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:52,645
good

65
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,181
Right

66
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,483
Didn’t you say that we need to investigate carefully?

67
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,485
What progress have these two great masters made?

68
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,393
spring rain

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,262
Is there any progress?

70
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,367
nothing

71
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,306
Chunyu said there was no progress yet

72
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,310
I don't have it yet either

73
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,621
Senior

74
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,191
Just now Teacher Zhao

75
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,759
When introducing the Turing test

76
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,593
the movie mentioned

77
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,327
What's it called?

78
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,462
Ex Machina

79
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,863
Okay, I'll look at it another day

80
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:44,997
By the way, there's another one

81
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,199
A biographical film dedicated to Turing

82
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,300
called the imitation game

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,067
Quite good looking

84
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,035
Highly recommended to you

85
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,203
spring rain

86
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:51,671
Sorry

87
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:52,672
spring rain

88
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:53,706
Is class over?

89
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:56,909
The library is newly opened

90
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,044
A good coffee shop

91
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:58,911
Do you want to go together?

92
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,780
I still have classes

93
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,915
Which building is it? I'll take you there.

94
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,750
No

95
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,018
You give it to your junior sister

96
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:06,919
Answer your questions

97
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:08,721
no

98
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,222
answer

99
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:12,925
Sorry

100
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:13,826
Let’s communicate next time

101
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,527
I have something else to do

102
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,728
Okay, senior

103
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,002
spring rain

104
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:24,937
spring rain

105
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,307
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

106
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,342
It's OK

107
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,320
In the context of the new era

108
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,155
Spiritual culture of the elderly

109
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,190
and learning needs

110
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,157
Faster growth

111
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,793
Show differentiation and diversification

112
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,995
multi-level features

113
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,565
Facing the new situation

114
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,567
New requirements, new challenges

115
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,069
What about the traditional education model for the elderly?

116
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,071
completely unsatisfied

117
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,606
Personalization for seniors

118
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,608
Diverse learning needs

119
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,777
and higher quality requirements

120
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,947
We need more innovative

121
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,081
Elderly education model

122
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,384
Open a new model of education for the elderly

123
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,985
inspire seniors

124
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,520
Passion for active learning

125
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,822
Expand new forms of education for the elderly

126
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,958
to change their quality of life

127
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,993
develop their intellectual abilities

128
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,129
Enrich their spiritual world

129
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,598
Make it easier for older people to integrate

130
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,966
Rapidly developing technology

131
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,900
modern society

132
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,669
for them

133
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,503
able to engage in

134
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,704
Meet the requirements of the times

135
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,673
Facilitate social activities

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:34,941
At the same time

137
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,043
And in line with their age level

138
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,277
and physical characteristics

139
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,499
Where are you

140
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,304
Lao Lin

141
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,606
Let's take a moment

142
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,607
Going to the supermarket to buy something

143
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,041
Do you want to come together?

144
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,109
You go ahead

145
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,944
I will be with my wife and kids soon

146
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,712
Pass a video

147
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,313
That's OK

148
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,948
Anyway, you are alone in the dormitory

149
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,116
Just take care of hygiene

150
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:17,984
Clean it up

151
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,919
He said he had to check at noon

152
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,579
Didn't you go to the supermarket?

153
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,148
Forgot my cell phone

154
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,116
You're so sneaky

155
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,117
What good stuff are you looking at?

156
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:26,886
Not authentic anymore, Lao Lin

157
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:27,420
You good thing

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,021
Let's share it with everyone

159
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,956
you let go

160
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:31,624
you

161
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,364
I just said this

162
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,799
Do you want to video chat with your wife?

163
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,000
You're not going to pick it up when it comes

164
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:49,875
Wife

165
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,343
Lin

166
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,978
Who is that vixen?

167
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,314
What did you say?

168
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,782
Stop playing dumb with me

169
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,383
I ask you

170
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,718
Where did the money in the passbook go?

171
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,552
What passbook

172
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,620
I don’t have a bankbook with me

173
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:02,888
Our family’s bankbook

174
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,156
Card folded into one

175
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,725
The bankbook is here with me

176
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,326
The bank card is on you

177
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,728
If not for the day before yesterday

178
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,862
Transfer living expenses to my daughter

179
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,664
I didn’t know I was missing eight thousand yuan.

180
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,365
this money

181
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,201
I didn't spend it on myself

182
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,603
I just bought a computer

183
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,271
Come

184
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:20,906
Come to invoice

185
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,007
Did you see it?

186
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:22,708
invoice

187
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:23,509
Did you see it?

188
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,711
What do you need a computer for?

189
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,712
For my daughter

190
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:27,913
I was thinking

191
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,248
Waiting for her birthday

192
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:29,949
Take it out again

193
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:30,916
give her a surprise

194
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,619
I can prove this, sister-in-law

195
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,221
This old Lin

196
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,155
hide the computer

197
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,923
No one will see this

198
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:39,959
Did you hear it?

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,594
Okay

200
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,863
We still have to go to the supermarket to do some shopping

201
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:44,663
Hang up

202
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,567
Finally I can watch blockbusters

203
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,602
Stop moving

204
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,236
Go, go, go

205
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,438
Aren't you going to the supermarket?

206
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,272
You go quickly

207
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:10,790
Mr. Yan

208
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:11,824
as you wish

209
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,192
New game level completed

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,193
Can be started immediately

211
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,195
Make sure nothing goes wrong

212
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,035
Fighting and killing is so boring.

213
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,271
Next

214
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,306
Let's try it out

215
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,073
People's hearts

216
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,818
Hello you are

217
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,120
My husband has been missing for three days

218
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,321
His name is Chen Jianzhang

219
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,989
He is the medical director of Guangming Hospital

220
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,524
This is my ID

221
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,626
This is proof of our relationship

222
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,830
Since he took leave two days ago

223
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,764
Just lost contact

224
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,666
No one answered the phone

225
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,868
He told me that he wanted to go back to his hometown

226
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:56,669
but not at all

227
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,837
His ticket purchase information

228
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,071
My family didn’t say anything either.

229
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,406
Didn't see him go back

230
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,307
OK please wait a moment

231
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,147
You said your husband

232
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,515
Which department is the medical director of?

233
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,749
neurosurgery

234
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:18,757
This way

235
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,525
your message

236
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,359
We have completed registration

237
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,360
As soon as there is any news

238
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,728
We will contact you promptly

239
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,564
You go back first

240
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,166
Still have to try hard

241
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,400
Get in touch with your husband

242
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:29,668
Thank you

243
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,139
Guangming Hospital

244
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,742
Or neurosurgery?

245
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,244
no

246
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,144
I have to inform the Leaf team immediately

247
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,779
The relationship between this hospital and Tianji

248
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,313
Not simple

249
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,105
Good morning

250
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:06,906
Hello, senior engineer

251
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,043
Right

252
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,945
There is one thing I want to trouble you with

253
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,380
Is there a map of the company?

254
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,147
Can you send it to me?

255
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,318
Our company has so many offices

256
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,219
I'm afraid I went wrong

257
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,086
OK

258
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,959
Already sent to your email

259
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:27,793
Pay attention to check

260
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,661
OK thank you

261
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,261
You are welcome

262
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:30,863
Understood

263
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,464
I'll keep it secret

264
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:33,999
Important equipment of microtechnology

265
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,434
It should be at device two

266
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,004
morning

267
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,921
Sure enough it's here

268
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,390
Gao Xuan

269
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,327
Nian Sulan

270
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,561
why are you here

271
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,264
We will meet each other wherever we are destined.

272
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,200
Right

273
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,601
What are you doing in Building 1?

274
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,804
new engineer

275
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,505
Shouldn't we be working in Building 2?

276
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,873
yes

277
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,275
I was just thinking

278
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,543
Come and visit the laboratory

279
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,945
I am also very interested in the laboratory

280
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,980
How about I go with you?

281
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,981
It's okay, no need

282
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:25,684
OK

283
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,986
If it doesn't take up your time

284
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,586
no delay

285
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,588
Okay, sorry to trouble you.

286
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:36,996
Manager Tang

287
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,365
miss nian

288
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,200
Come, come, come

289
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:41,834
welcome

290
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:42,301
Come

291
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,168
Please come inside

292
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:44,837
Unexpectedly, Miss Nian

293
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,105
Will you come to visit us?

294
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,039
I've heard it from my dad a long time ago

295
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,073
The laboratory is particularly interesting

296
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,641
I came here specially to take a look today

297
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,244
It’s not really a laboratory.

298
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,512
Just one

299
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,514
Device Management Center

300
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,116
It doesn’t matter

301
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:58,317
Right

302
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,318
Take me, senior, quickly

303
00:16:59,351 --> 00:16:59,952
Look around

304
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:00,953
OK

305
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,521
I don’t know about senior engineers

306
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,922
Which part of our place

307
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,890
More interested

308
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,925
To be honest with you, Manager Tang

309
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,794
I'm interested in everything

310
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,062
I might have to trouble you

311
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,096
You are welcome

312
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:12,965
That's it

313
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,235
Our equipment center

314
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,202
The main job

315
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,203
Divided into three parts

316
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,937
One

317
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,907
Is the management of daily office equipment

318
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:22,708
Two

319
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,276
Is the management of R&D equipment

320
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,345
Three

321
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,946
It is the management of self-developed equipment

322
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,481
By the way, senior engineer

323
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,650
Look at what you have besides these

324
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,819
Anything else you want to know

325
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,588
You just said self-developed equipment

326
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,356
I quite want to

327
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,323
Learn more about it

328
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,558
This one

329
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,395
What about self-developed equipment?

330
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,430
involves some

331
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,664
company secrets

332
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm afraid it's not very convenient

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,234
OK, I know very well

334
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,336
Then I'm sorry

335
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,137
This way

336
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,038
Take a look here

337
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,006
okay

338
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,047
OK

339
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:02,714
Manager Tang

340
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,182
You stay

341
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:03,916
Let's go first

342
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:04,483
good

343
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,085
That year the young lady walked slowly

344
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:06,752
Senior engineer walks slowly

345
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,553
Sorry to trouble you

346
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:07,986
good

347
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,098
good day

348
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,999
Because there are beautiful people around me

349
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,169
This sugar is so sprinkled

350
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,204
Likely

351
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,206
I'll kill you single guy

352
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,046
Nian Sulan

353
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,583
There is something

354
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,184
I want to say sorry to you

355
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:40,819
What's up

356
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,554
Today I was

357
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:43,889
I want to visit the equipment department

358
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,958
But because there is no reservation

359
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:46,859
So I can't get in

360
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,193
I took advantage of your identity

361
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,263
This shows

362
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,664
I'm valuable to you

363
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,600
I didn't mean that

364
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,235
I want to say

365
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,070
I won't use you again in the future

366
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,438
What's this

367
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,405
I don't mind

368
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,509
What I like is Chunyu

369
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:04,676
Sorry

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,000
sister

371
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,339
Sister, why are you here?

372
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,917
Is it still like that?

373
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,754
Don't you like music?

374
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,059
Xiao Xian

375
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,327
Did she force you to do so?

376
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,761
I was lazy as soon as I left

377
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,639
She is more talented than you

378
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,982
The tip of the sword must be accurate

379
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:51,883
move forward

380
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:52,551
move forward

381
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,285
good

382
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,219
sword tip

383
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,287
Pay attention to the rhythm

384
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,021
good

385
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,223
Back Back

386
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:00,726
good

387
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:03,829
Pay attention to the rhythm

388
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:04,763
Pay attention to the rhythm

389
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,669
Pay attention to the fast pace

390
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,004
Be more fierce. Be more fierce.

391
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:12,604
fierce

392
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,305
yes good

393
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,239
right

394
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,741
insist

395
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:16,842
insist

396
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,076
insist

397
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:21,880
Rest for ten minutes

398
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,225
what are you playing

399
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,626
I'm playing a game console

400
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,560
do you want to play

401
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,498
Look, this is us

402
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,099
let's avoid them

403
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,200
Hit them too

404
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,402
Click this Click this

405
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,836
Click this and we can move

406
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:45,904
Click four keys

407
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:46,838
Any key will do

408
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,106
See if it's moving

409
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,808
Let me tell you, this is really fun

410
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,279
Nan Xiaoqin

411
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,484
You've had enough rest

412
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,019
Isn’t it ten minutes?

413
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,387
You've had enough rest

414
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,063
enter

415
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,230
sword tip

416
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,165
Pay attention to the tip of the sword

417
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:14,700
retreat

418
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,002
enough

419
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,440
pick up the sword

420
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:22,908
continue

421
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,044
We are not your substitute

422
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,279
We are not here to make amends

423
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,313
your regret

424
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,383
This path is yours to choose

425
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,118
I'm just

426
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,786
I just don't want to disappoint you

427
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:36,788
so many years

428
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,589
i never have

429
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,490
past myself

430
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,991
All I have is you

431
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,427
I have already paid

432
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,962
It cost me a leg

433
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:44,930
I won't let you again

434
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,597
use your dreams

435
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,032
crush another youth

436
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,568
Xiao Xian

437
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,602
you tell her

438
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,437
What you want to pick up is not the foil sword

439
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,238
It's the guitar

440
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:00,345
Walk

441
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:03,682
sister

442
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,218
I don't want to disappoint my mother

443
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,553
The decision my mother made for me

444
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,688
Must be the best

445
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:11,990
in addition

446
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,658
if something happens

447
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,993
Make mom happy

448
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,762
I'm willing to try

449
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,105
She chose this path herself

450
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,780
After your father resigned

451
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,315
It's never been touched here

452
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,384
Haven't cleaned in months

453
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,351
The gray is a bit big

454
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:16,621
spring rain

455
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,191
Where is your father?

456
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,859
Is one of the founders of the company

457
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,128
So we kept

458
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,995
this office

459
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,964
It's also respect for him

460
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,233
after he left

461
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,302
Is there no news about him?

462
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,638
He left too suddenly

463
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,407
Didn't say the reason

464
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,276
But it's always been the same here

465
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,512
Take your time and watch

466
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:41,913
hope to find some

467
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:42,681
his clues

468
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:43,982
Thank you

469
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:29,828
spring rain

470
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,596
Keep an eye on your Gao Xuan

471
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,739
The alumni group has exploded

472
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,007
Everyone is spreading the word

473
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,642
Say they made it official

474
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,644
Take good care of your family, Gao Xuan.

475
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,280
Who?

476
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,524
Latest model

477
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,162
What happened to your brother last time

478
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,097
I went a little too far

479
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,164
It's a compensation

480
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:16,835
Don't look down on it

481
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,009
What about live broadcast?

482
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:25,777
you arrive

483
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,514
Senior sister

484
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,816
What do you want from me?

485
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,521
No one else in the dormitory is here

486
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,426
do you want me to

487
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,595
Keep an eye on her for you

488
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,167
If it's not troublesome

489
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,301
Just take it easy

490
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,606
I'm sorry

491
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:55,473
Chunyu is my friend

492
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,107
i can't help you

493
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:56,741
Don't, don't, don't

494
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,009
This is a small gift

495
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,378
Or you can give me something as well

496
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,179
We reciprocate politely

497
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:01,980
This won't work

498
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,914
this game it

499
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:03,748
game

500
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,018
Could it be Gao Xuan and Chun Yu?

501
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,086
The one we play with, right?

502
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:09,788
Yes

503
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:10,955
I'm in that game too

504
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:11,890
But this game

505
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,590
Okay, Okay

506
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,425
That's it

507
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:14,325
You keep the perfume

508
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,160
I took this

509
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:15,727
I

510
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,063
I also have this helmet

511
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,564
What's so great

512
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,836
Anyway, I reminded you

513
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,198
So angry

514
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:00,872
How is it

515
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,606
Isn't this better?

516
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:04,442
Xiaoqin

517
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,443
why are you so late

518
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,177
I've been waiting for you for a long time

519
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:06,978
what do you want to do

520
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:15,520
wrist braces

521
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:16,621
I gave it to you

522
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,423
what happened yesterday

523
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,657
I was wrong

524
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,126
I apologize to you

525
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,962
Don't be angry with me, okay?

526
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:27,632
never mind

527
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,803
Just want to stay by myself for a while

528
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,738
I'm going back to the dormitory first

529
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,272
You go

530
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,607
Xiaoqin

531
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:39,964
What are you talking about?

532
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,366
My own helmet is better

533
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,269
It turns out that Gao Xuan and Chunyu

534
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,104
Just playing this game

535
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,061
I am

536
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,398
Entered the game

537
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,207
spring rain

538
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,647
You must have many questions in your mind

539
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,716
Only continue

540
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,018
Only you can know the answer

541
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:18,930
spring rain

542
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:21,966
Lin Uncle Lin

543
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:23,668
you

544
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,270
Did you see anyone else?

545
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:27,638
No

546
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,273
just me

547
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,242
Did you hear that?

548
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,276
what's the sound

549
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:33,911
no

550
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,287
What does it smell like?

551
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,258
What a broken place

552
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,326
wet

553
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,265
Is anyone there?

554
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,436
Senior, are you there?

555
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,106
Senior Gao Xuan

556
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,241
who

557
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,112
Don't, don't, don't

558
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:08,880
it's me

559
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:09,547
Eighty thousand

560
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,549
Acting all day long

561
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,216
Are you annoyed?

562
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,486
No, I'm not pretending

563
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,754
I just walked out normally

564
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:17,388
shut up

565
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,222
don't want to talk to you

566
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,034
what is this place

567
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,436
nuclear bomb base

568
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,073
Xiaoqin

569
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,107
is it possible

570
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:36,908
The scene in this level

571
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:37,875
is the most anti-human

572
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,177
731 black sun

573
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,257
Sprained ankle

574
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,325
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

575
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,059
Can't leave

576
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:55,927
Can't leave, Xiaoqin

577
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,228
Sprained ankle

578
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,740
What's up

579
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:12,877
Are you okay?

580
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,384
It's okay

581
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,386
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

582
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,788
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

583
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,589
It hurts me so much. It hurts me so much.

584
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,924
It hurts so much. It's stuck.

585
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:27,725
Can't take it out

586
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,394
It hurts. It hurts.

587
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:32,597
It hurts so much. It hurts so much.

588
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,197
Does it still hurt?

589
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:34,432
It hurts

590
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,900
Look, it hurts so much that I'm sweating

591
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,002
It still hurts

592
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,270
Then cut it off

593
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:39,904
Don't

594
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:41,205
I

595
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:41,706
not me

596
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,306
Pulled out

597
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,141
Come out Come out

598
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,308
Don't, don't, don't

599
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,343
Don't be angry Don't be angry Don't be angry

600
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:45,843
I

601
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,378
Xiaoqin, I'm kidding you

602
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:47,645
This

603
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:48,479
right

604
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,885
you or else

605
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,353
Don't be angry with me, okay?

606
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,021
Ours

607
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:58,189
At once

608
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:00,458
All right

609
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:01,459
who

610
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:12,904
Senior sister

611
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,205
Xu Wenya

612
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:14,906
no

613
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,808
You really came in

614
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,180
I'll just come and experience it casually

615
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,148
Look at the games you are all playing

616
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:24,949
exactly how

617
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,021
Fine

618
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,289
Let's go then

619
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,192
Lead the way

620
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,099
Senior sister

621
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,235
This game is actually

622
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:44,969
Very average

623
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,538
Whether it is the environment or atmosphere

624
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:48,539
tell the truth

625
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,141
Than the games developed by my dad’s company

626
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:50,808
Far from it

627
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,143
Right

628
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,277
What about the rest

629
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,080
you say

630
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:57,982
Senior Gao and others

631
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,351
What are you anxious about?

632
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,352
Won't you see me later?

633
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,420
I didn't say I was in a hurry.

634
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,088
I'll ask my teammates what others are there?

635
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:06,824
All right

636
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:15,700
What sound?

637
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,836
No, I don’t know

638
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,378
Isn't it just a game?

639
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,313
As for being afraid?

640
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,748
You are too timid

641
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,270
Xiao Gao

642
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,604
What are you looking at?

643
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,073
Nothing, Uncle Lin

644
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,742
You are here

645
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,644
The two of us are at the front entrance

646
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,278
encountered

647
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,017
This

648
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:07,618
There's a conflict

649
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,224
Take the initiative

650
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:15,426
OK

651
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,061
They seem to be in front

652
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,663
I'll go find them

653
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:22,400
spring rain

654
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,404
are you right to me

655
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,338
Is there any misunderstanding?

656
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,809
Yesterday I went to Micro Technology

657
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:32,843
Something really happened

658
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,378
I also accidentally

659
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,346
Meet Nian Sulan

660
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,580
when she took photos

661
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,782
I have absolutely no idea

662
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,986
Everyone is an adult

663
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,387
you have your own business

664
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,188
I have my own business

665
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,556
Everyone is busy with their own things.

666
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,458
spring rain

667
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,629
Nian Sulan and I

668
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:52,663
Nothing really

669
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,098
Don't think too much

670
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,301
That's not what I care about

671
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,240
You really don't have anything else to do

672
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,275
Are you going to tell me?

673
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,678
what other things

674
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:12,983
Walk

675
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:19,423
Eighty thousand

676
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,125
Were you shouting just now?

677
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:21,926
no

678
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:22,960
I thought it was you

679
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:24,362
That

680
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:26,897
Where is Xu Wenya?

681
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,199
It’s Xu Wenya

682
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:29,600
elegant

683
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,673
Senior

684
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,074
Nian Sulan

685
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,478
Senior

686
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,246
Great to see you today

687
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,181
Those monsters just now were so scary

688
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,082
i feel myself

689
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,016
Almost dead

690
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:46,550
monster

691
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:47,985
What monster are you talking about?

692
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:48,953
and

693
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:49,920
Why are you in the game?

694
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,723
I didn't see any monster clearly.

695
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,326
As for games?

696
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,264
I heard this game is very good

697
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,098
you are all playing

698
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,167
So I looked for Wenya

699
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,468
Asked about the game

700
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,970
And this gaming helmet

701
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,704
I already have it

702
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:07,505
Xu Wenya

703
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,506
How can you be casual

704
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,707
Tell her about the game

705
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:11,475
That

706
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,944
Did she have to ask?

707
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,113
I wanted to remind her that she was in danger

708
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,248
She ran away without listening

709
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:17,948
It's OK

710
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,550
How can we call it a game if it's not dangerous?

711
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,285
Say it again

712
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,720
Senior, aren’t you a master?

713
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,021
I'm ready to hug your thigh

714
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:24,955
Just lie down and win

715
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,726
in this game

716
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:29,927
But there is no great god

717
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,529
You have to rely on yourself

718
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:32,696
no problem

719
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:33,831
I can protect myself

720
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,067
and

721
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,470
Dear fellow students,

722
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,539
You are all veterans

723
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,007
I'm a newbie

724
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,442
I need to trouble you to take care of me

725
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,184
OK OK

726
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,286
Everyone is here

727
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,068
Everyone

728
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,904
Today’s game is actually very simple

729
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:14,872
Game name

730
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,273
Guess who is lying

731
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,875
game rules

732
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,643
One question and one answer

733
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,878
if lie

734
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,079
severe punishment

735
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,182
Quiz game

736
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,318
sounds like

737
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,019
It's relatively simple

738
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,754
The simpler, the more dangerous it is

739
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,823
Have we suffered too many losses?

740
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,227
That's right

741
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:37,962
There's no way to escape anyway

742
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,163
Just face it bravely

743
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,297
That's all it can do

744
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,033
Game starts

745
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,969
please first player

746
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,304
Stand in front of the door and start answering

747
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:03,954
That

748
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,490
Which of us will go first?

749
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,600
Now they all have opinions about me

750
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,302
The situation must be reversed

751
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,641
Then I'll help you out.

752
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,385
Player confirmation

753
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,920
Nian Sulan

754
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,522
I found this

755
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,257
There is someone you hate the most

756
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,760
Please say her name

757
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,642
Of course there is no one I hate

758
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,279
Judgment

759
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:08,385
lie
