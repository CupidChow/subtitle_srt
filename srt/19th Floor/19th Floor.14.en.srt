1
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Brother Qiang

2
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,280
Eighty thousand

3
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,960
you how you

4
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,320
I thought it was over

5
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,000
You're down there alone

6
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,360
I came down here to save you.

7
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Brother Qiang

8
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,480
Just don't follow me

9
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,280
So much nonsense

10
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,040
Who made us brothers?

11
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
What about the others?

12
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,640
How about everyone else up there?

13
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,680
What about Doudou?

14
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,520
Is Doudou okay?

15
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't worry

16
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,600
They're safe up there

17
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
Doudou all day long

18
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
game

19
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
Run out of the finish line

20
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,560
Start

21
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,320
So that's the end

22
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Let's go first

23
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
It's that simple

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Yes

25
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
This is too simple

26
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
The game before that

27
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,960
All so strange

28
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,560
I guess it’s because of our two brothers.

29
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
You've suffered too much before, right?

30
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,400
What will happen if it falls?

31
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
This will lead to death. What will happen?

32
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,880
It's okay

33
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
I won't jump down by myself

34
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,080
Who knows?

35
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,160
how does this feel

36
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,120
Something's wrong

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Yes, the distance from this door

38
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,600
As if nothing has changed

39
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
It's because we walked too slowly

40
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Wait a moment

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,760
It just said this level

42
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,640
What's your name?

43
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,360
Run out of the finish line

44
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
Are you going to run?

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,840
Then let's try running together

46
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,640
OK

47
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,320
Let's go

48
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,920
Eighty thousand, let me tell you

49
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,800
Running since childhood

50
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm a professional

51
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,080
no no

52
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,640
wait a moment

53
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,240
Brother Qiang

54
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Don't run so fast

55
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,240
Just wait for me

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,600
right

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
We are both equally fast

58
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,200
run together

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,600
good

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,240
Why is this door still so far away?

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
Let's leave it alone. Let's run.

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,480
Let’s talk after we run away

63
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,400
OK

64
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,520
feel

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,640
Nothing has changed at all

66
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,520
this door

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,280
Then let's run faster and try

68
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,240
Accelerate Accelerate

69
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Brother Qiang

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120
How do I feel the distance

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,720
Nothing has changed at all

72
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,360
Let’s talk after we run away

73
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
Etc., etc

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,560
Not strong strong brother

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing? Keep running.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,440
No, wait a moment

77
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,400
What are you doing?

78
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,560
no

79
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,160
You keep running like this

80
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,080
Something's definitely wrong

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Brother Qiang

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,040
You take two more steps forward

83
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,760
Take two steps in my direction

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Come, come, come

85
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,400
What's the meaning

86
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,160
Don't stop Don't stop

87
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,720
You go on

88
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,600
what do you mean

89
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Can you tell?

90
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,400
What can I tell?

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,320
Look

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
That is to say, we only need

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,080
walk backwards

94
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,160
That's right

95
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,960
Yes

96
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,840
Take one

97
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
No, Brother Qiang

98
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,440
How do I feel about this wall?

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,960
There's still something not quite right.

100
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:11,920
no

101
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Brother Qiang

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,920
What's up

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,200
Brother Qiang

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,480
How do I feel the distance

105
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,640
Nothing has changed at all

106
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
Don't worry about it for now. Let's run away later.

107
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,160
what do you mean

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,440
So the real rules of the game are

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,160
Only one person runs in the opposite direction

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,480
A person is not moving or running forward

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
to run out of that door

112
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
That is to say, the two of us

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Only one person can pass the level

114
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:46,960
Brother Qiang

115
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,520
Brother Qiang

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,160
Brother Qiang

117
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
What's up

118
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,120
What are you thinking about?

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
What's going on down here

120
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Is it game over?

121
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,840
It's been so long

122
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
Why isn't it over yet?

123
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
Waiting like this is not an option

124
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Let's all look for it again

125
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
See if there is any mechanism

126
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,760
you say

127
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Will people change?

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,040
You mean Brother Qiang?

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,240
But Brother Qiang is here to save 80,000 people

130
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,040
Just went down

131
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,400
Can

132
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
before life and death

133
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Will the original intention change?

134
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,080
Brother Qiang

135
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,400
What should I do?

136
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,880
Eighty thousand

137
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,840
What's up

138
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,240
I know your brother

139
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Just because I'm there

140
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,320
wasted time

141
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
That’s why I made you come down

142
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
Brother Qiang, OK

143
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
Don't talk about this

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,360
It has nothing to do with you

145
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,680
What about this time?

146
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,000
Just treat me as your brother and I will give it back to you.

147
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,160
Brother Qiang

148
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,880
Brother Qiang

149
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,920
You follow me like this

150
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Neither of us can get out

151
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,560
Brother Qiang, believe me

152
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,120
There must be a way

153
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,280
We can both get out

154
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,440
Brother Qiang

155
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,600
Calm down

156
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,400
Brother, you have to run

157
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
Can you run over there?

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,040
You let me be a hero for once

159
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,840
Okay ah

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,520
Brother Qiang Brother Qiang

161
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,440
you listen to me

162
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,160
Brother Qiang

163
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,400
Calm down

164
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,880
I was

165
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,960
It's to save Doudou

166
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,840
no matter what i

167
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,560
Can't let Doudou

168
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,320
Got the bomb

169
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,480
That's why I wasted my time

170
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:18,920
came down

171
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
It has nothing to do with you

172
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
Please let me take a breath first

173
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,760
No, I really can't run anymore

174
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,920
I'm so tired

175
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,760
Brother Qiang

176
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,120
I can't run anymore

177
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
I really can't run anymore, Brother Qiang

178
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,800
no

179
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,880
Brother, I can't run anymore

180
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,680
I really can't run anymore

181
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
Give me a break

182
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,840
Just a moment

183
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,760
Brother Qiang

184
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,560
No more

185
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,680
No way, it's too late

186
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
No, I can't hold on to this anymore

187
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,520
What to do

188
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,240
what to do

189
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,520
I really can't hold on to this thing.

190
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
I've lost two brothers

191
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
Brother Qiang, think of a way

192
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:07,960
what to do

193
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,120
Can't lose another one

194
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,840
Brother Qiang

195
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,880
What are you doing?

196
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,560
Brat, I'm telling you

197
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,080
If you wait a moment and follow me again

198
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,880
I'll kill you

199
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,880
no no no

200
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,440
wait wait wait

201
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,520
Brother Qiang, what's wrong with you?

202
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,880
Brother Qiang

203
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,560
what to do

204
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,800
Not brothers

205
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,520
After you go out

206
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,760
Better do me a favor

207
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,600
Please help me go see A Yong

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,640
With Hei Er’s grandma

209
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,840
All right

210
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,720
Brother Qiang, let me tell you

211
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,440
That's your own business

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,400
You have to do it yourself

213
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
you are my brother

214
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,840
I asked you to help me with this

215
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,680
you can't help

216
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,160
no

217
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,680
Then leave me here now

218
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,960
You are not my eldest brother yet

219
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,440
Big brother

220
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,560
Big brother

221
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,360
Big brother

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
Big brother

223
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,200
Brother Qiang

224
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,320
Brother Qiang

225
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,240
no

226
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,320
Brother Qiang

227
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,320
Brother Qiang

228
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,080
Stop, Brother Qiang

229
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,200
I am Zhang Tianqiang

230
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,680
All I do is run away

231
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,120
this time

232
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,880
I still have to run

233
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,920
Brother Qiang

234
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,800
Brother Qiang, stop

235
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Hurry up Zhang Tianqiang

236
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,240
faster

237
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,520
Brother Qiang, no

238
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,360
Brother Qiang

239
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,680
don't want

240
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,200
Brother Qiang

241
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,440
Brother Qiang

242
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
don't want

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,240
Brother Qiang

244
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
Brother Qiang

245
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,960
Brother Qiang

246
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,240
Eighty thousand

247
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,600
Come out

248
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,920
It's okay, 80,000

249
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,240
It's not your fault

250
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,400
I am strong strong strong

251
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,880
Strong brother him

252
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Congratulations everyone

253
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,600
The Nineteen-Storey World Part One

254
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,080
pass

255
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,640
Can't die

256
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,160
I haven't helped you yet

257
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Are you chasing Doudou?

258
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,160
Eighty thousand

259
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Eighty thousand

260
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,240
Eighty thousand

261
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,120
Stop thinking about it

262
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,520
It’s not your fault

263
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,920
Even Brother Qiang is in a coma now

264
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,440
this game

265
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,480
When will it be the first time?

266
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,560
Eighty thousand

267
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,000
never mind

268
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,320
let him be

269
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,560
Just let him be alone

270
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,520
But Xu Wenya

271
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
What should we tell her?

272
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,760
Brother Qiang is in the hospital now

273
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,760
People who died in the game

274
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,200
In reality, you will fall into a coma

275
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,840
so

276
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,000
want to save them

277
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
You have to enter the game

278
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,520
And pass the level

279
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,120
Is there any way

280
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
Don't enter the game

281
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,600
If they ask you to sign a

282
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,120
Game Experience Officer Agreement

283
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,440
It's better not to sign

284
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,560
In this case

285
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,160
Can you escape everything?

286
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
no

287
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,120
reality and games

288
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,920
How is there any contact?

289
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,640
Why does this happen?

290
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
Put it on me

291
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,600
spring rain

292
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,000
You, you are kidding me

293
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,800
Yes or no

294
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,520
I know

295
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,480
before me

296
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,400
Talking a little hastily

297
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,000
Not very good to you

298
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,160
You may not like me very much

299
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,160
but

300
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,040
We don't want

301
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,200
Make fun of this

302
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,800
ok

303
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,000
Why don't you speak?

304
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,840
You speak

305
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,200
Can you tell me the truth?

306
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm telling the truth

307
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,200
What should I do?

308
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,080
spring rain

309
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,040
you will protect me

310
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,920
right?

311
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,720
I will find a way

312
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,880
Remove the chip

313
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,520
need a

314
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
Special pulse equipment

315
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,760
You went to Tianji Company

316
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Look for equipment

317
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,320
this software

318
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,160
Can copy Tianji’s access card

319
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,080
why do you know

320
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,720
So many things about the 19th floor

321
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,160
You are a Tianji person

322
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,960
no

323
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,000
You don't say anything either

324
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,240
Are you meditating?

325
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,440
no

326
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,040
I can tell you

327
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,000
What's your name?

328
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,040
what's it called

329
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,600
What do you call the strong one?

330
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
I have paid off all his money.

331
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,560
Hold it back

332
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
Useless stuff

333
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,480
yes

334
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm worthless

335
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
It will only hurt your friends

336
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,480
hold

337
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
Do you know your Uncle Zhang?

338
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,880
car accident

339
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,640
That day

340
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,320
I should have been the one driving the car

341
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,800
He's doing my job because he's doing it for me

342
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,880
Driving while fatigued

343
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,280
After he was paralyzed

344
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,040
many years

345
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,520
I live in self-blame

346
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,600
but

347
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,840
But blame yourself

348
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,360
It didn't make me relieved

349
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,280
Didn't let him stand up again

350
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
Instead, let me and him

351
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,480
live longer

352
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,600
The longer you live, the harder you work

353
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,040
All these years

354
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,200
I always

355
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
Supporting their family

356
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
But I know

357
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
It's wrong not to pay back the money

358
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,920
no excuse

359
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,720
i was wrong

360
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,920
And let me tell you

361
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,120
Just say sorry

362
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
That's not ability

363
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
Can be solved sorry

364
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,600
That's the point

365
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,080
No dad

366
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,840
okay

367
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,600
boy

368
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,680
There are no cowards in our old Yang family

369
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,120
Didn't I say yesterday

370
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
Go to the hospital today

371
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Are you looking at Qingyou, Brother Qiang?

372
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,360
Where are you

373
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,840
dad

374
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm going back to school first

375
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,600
You finish your meal before leaving

376
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm almost done

377
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:31,960
Don't, don't, don't

378
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,520
No more, Dad

379
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,720
Me I'm too late

380
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,240
no

381
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,960
Too late

382
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,960
It's too late, hurry up and get out

383
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,680
Hurry up

384
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,120
Quick, quick, quick, get out

385
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,800
Let's go, Dad

386
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,240
Get out of here

387
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,280
By the way, Dad

388
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,600
Thank you

389
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,400
Thanks

390
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,960
Thank you

391
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,240
Nasty

392
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
Let me ask

393
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,760
patients who live here

394
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,200
Where have you gone?

395
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,880
Have you been transferred to another hospital?

396
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,720
I don’t know the details either.

397
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,560
Ask the nurse

398
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,000
spring rain

399
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,280
Brother Qiang is missing

400
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,080
Where have you gone?

401
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,800
have no idea

402
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Qingyou is also missing

403
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,800
nurse

404
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,960
Hello, let me ask

405
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,560
The tranquility of Ward No. 4

406
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,920
and Zhang Tianqiang from Ward No. 3

407
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,560
Where have you gone?

408
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,360
Let me check it for you

409
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,840
No. 4

410
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,600
Quiet

411
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
Their condition is special

412
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,480
Has been transferred to the special care ward

413
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,200
Special care unit

414
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,240
Where are you?

415
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,320
Only the patient's family

416
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,040
to enter

417
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,080
Intensive care unit visit

418
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,520
Are you two family members?

419
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,480
no

420
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,920
But we are very good friends

421
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,840
Friends can't

422
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,120
It must be

423
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,440
Only immediate family members of the patient can

424
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,680
This is the rule of our hospital

425
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,320
Not a doctor

426
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,320
We are really him

427
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,920
very good friend

428
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,080
Can you

429
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,840
I'm sorry

430
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,160
Really not possible

431
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,680
In the bathhouse today

432
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,840
The person who met Dr. Jia

433
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,160
I always feel like I’ve seen it somewhere

434
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,680
And on the back of his right hand

435
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,360
There is a very obvious mole

436
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,720
Doctor

437
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,280
Just be accommodating

438
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,840
okay

439
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,000
The hospital has hospital regulations

440
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,040
Let's not cause any trouble

441
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,880
Thank you

442
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,160
Walk

443
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,040
This is the situation

444
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I'll just talk about the director

445
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,440
Something doesn't look right at first glance

446
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,360
Then we now

447
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,440
Do you want to tell Lao Gao first?

448
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,880
he is in class

449
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Don’t tell him now

450
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,280
What should I do?

451
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,600
How about we first

452
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,640
Keep an eye on this Director Chen

453
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,760
We have watched Dr. Jia before

454
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,960
The effect is not very good

455
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,680
And they are now

456
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,480
Everyone found us

457
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm sure you won't reveal your flaws easily.

458
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,480
What do you think we should do?

459
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,280
We have to find this special care unit first.

460
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,440
But that's not to say

461
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,200
we are not relatives

462
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,600
Are you not allowed to enter the special care ward?

463
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,560
Put on this clothes

464
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,840
I feel very uneasy

465
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,160
If not for Brother Qiang

466
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
I won't do this

467
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,360
I didn’t see the special care ward here either.

468
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,240
Eighty thousand

469
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,360
All four of them are here

470
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,280
What should I do? Chunyu

471
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,240
How to get them out?

472
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,840
Go, go, go

473
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,320
I've already taken it

474
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,920
video here

475
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
You are too courageous

476
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,720
Wait for a while to be educated and criticized.

477
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,240
if you don't give us

478
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,160
a word of explanation

479
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,080
I will soon

480
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,240
Send the video

481
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,920
calm down

482
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,880
let's talk

483
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,160
What to talk about

484
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,960
Secret

485
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,840
That's all I know

486
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,320
I'm also paying attention

487
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,720
Those patients in the special care ward

488
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,880
so

489
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
When I saw you guys coming in

490
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,800
I followed here

491
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,520
So where is Dr. Jia now?

492
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,280
I don't know either

493
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,680
I can't contact him now

494
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,240
You have to help us find the truth

495
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,920
Also help us rescue our friends

496
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,480
this could be us

497
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,400
Only chance

498
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,240
It's me who doesn't recognize people clearly

499
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
I will help you

500
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,760
Video of today’s ward

501
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,960
You keep it

502
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,880
use evidence

503
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,080
in exchange for

504
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
you mean this

505
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,720
I'm afraid this is not enough

506
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,200
We have to think of another way

507
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,600
I heard Xiao Jia say

508
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,880
Tianji was taken away

509
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,080
That agreement of yours

510
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,280
Today's video

511
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
Can confirm player is unconscious

512
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
And that agreement

513
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,920
It can be proved

514
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,160
Players and secrets

515
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,800
There is indeed a contractual relationship

516
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,400
These two things

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,760
A complete chain of evidence is formed

518
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,040
Hello

519
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,680
Hello Lao Gao

520
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,400
where are you

521
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,680
I was out

522
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,360
Is there something wrong?

523
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,320
I want to tell you

524
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,480
We're about to take action

525
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,280
Chunyu won't let me say it

526
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,840
But I think

527
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,800
I still have to tell you

528
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,120
action

529
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,800
what action

530
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,560
Chunyu and I went to shoot

531
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,880
Video of Brother Qiang and the others in coma

532
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,840
We're going to figure it out tonight

533
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,000
When he sneaked into Tianji to find us,

534
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
The experience agreement you signed

535
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,200
This way we have control

536
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,520
Evidence that Tianji is involved in the conspiracy?

537
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
Then use this thing again

538
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,160
Go force them to wake up Brother Qiang

539
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,600
He Qingyou

540
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,000
Get everyone out of the game at the same time

541
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,000
This action is so hasty

542
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,640
Why not in advance

543
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,360
Discuss this with me

544
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,760
this this

545
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,160
Chunyu is afraid that you won’t agree with me

546
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
Just kill it first and then play it.

547
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,360
Okay, Lao Gao

548
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,880
I won’t tell you anymore

549
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,440
Don't tell Chunyu

550
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,120
I told you

551
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm leaving soon

552
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,760
what to do

553
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,480
Go Go

554
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,120
What are you doing?

555
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,560
what to do

556
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,000
This investigation is too strict.

557
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,160
It doesn’t matter

558
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,800
wait until night

559
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,360
Climb the window

560
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400
Or crawl through the ventilation duct?

561
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,280
It's not like making a movie

562
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,320
What should I do?

563
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,600
This place looks

564
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
Not even a back door

565
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,600
What kind of broken company is this?

566
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,760
All the money is spent on the security department

567
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,960
What's up

568
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,840
What do you want to do with me

569
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,640
rest assured

570
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,800
I won't do anything to you

571
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,920
You just need to be here with us

572
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,160
rest for a while

573
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,400
no

574
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,440
I

575
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,920
i don't know anything

576
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,600
Why are you arresting me?

577
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,000
What are you doing?

578
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,960
let me go

579
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,840
let go

580
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,680
take me where

581
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,760
Be prepared to meet them

582
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,280
Play with them

583
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,720
yes

584
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
This is Tianji Technology

585
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,640
The latest virtual reality equipment

586
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,000
How exciting

587
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,760
