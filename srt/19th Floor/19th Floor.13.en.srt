1
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
Why am I here?

2
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
It's not a prank, is it?

3
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,080
What's up

4
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
What is this?

5
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,720
arrive

6
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,640
two persons

7
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,640
You guys are so fast

8
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,360
Uncle Lin

9
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,280
We also just arrived

10
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,080
Lao Gao

11
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,840
And me

12
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Doudou

13
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Doudou me me me

14
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,080
Eighty thousand

15
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,480
Brother Qiang

16
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,880
Let me tell you

17
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,400
Wait a moment and go in

18
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,080
stand behind me

19
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
i can protect you

20
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,320
good

21
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,040
and

22
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
Your brother and I are not a fool either.

23
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,920
her affairs

24
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
I will also help you then

25
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,600
Are you really lying?

26
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,880
That's for sure. Why did I lie to you?

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
But we have to save A Yong first.

28
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,320
Chunyu Senior

29
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
Why are you here?

30
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
Xu Wenya

31
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,920
you

32
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,960
What's your name? What's your name?

33
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,400
Yang Bawan, you look like you’re fooling around

34
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
Do you know a man

35
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
The biggest charm of your body

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,680
what is

37
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,120
sense of security

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
Brother, let me teach you a trick

39
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Beauty

40
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,000
I tell you

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Wait a minute after we go in

42
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,640
It's quite dangerous in there

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,400
But don't be afraid

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,360
Stand behind me and I will protect you

45
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,960
Are you crazy?

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,200
Who wants you to protect Brother Qiang?

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,080
My strong brother, strong brother

48
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Brother Qiang Brother Qiang Brother Qiang

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,480
Forget it, forget it

50
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,160
How can we meet for the first time?

51
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,800
Just hit people

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Forget it, forget it, forget it

53
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
this touch

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,880
This dream is too real, right?

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
Each of you

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
it all seems possible

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Very incredible

58
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
But Xu Wenya

59
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,000
this is not a dream

60
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,640
not a dream

61
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,480
Then we now

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Where is it?

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,320
game

64
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,400
game

65
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,840
But

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,040
How did I get in?

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Think about it

68
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,200
have you ever worn one

69
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,840
Tianji Technology

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,960
Virtual reality equipment

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,240
When I was unpacking the express in the afternoon

72
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,160
I wore a helmet

73
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,320
So this is really a game

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,760
Then you are veteran drivers.

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
This is not a simple game

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,880
Anyway, wait a moment

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't ask too much

78
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,560
Don't talk nonsense

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,440
what do we do

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,560
Just do whatever you want

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,040
How did you enter the game?

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Still acting like a big devil

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,920
Everyone, let's go

84
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,440
Do we have to go in?

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,000
You can play outside alone

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,080
No one stops you

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,920
Why are everyone so fierce?

88
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,960
This battle

89
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,280
It looks very perverted at first glance.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,120
This looks pretty exciting

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,120
Why are you so perverted?

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,480
Classmate Xu

93
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,680
as a senior

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,280
I still want to give you one

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,040
a kind reminder

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,160
It's dangerous here

97
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,320
be safe

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
Two of you

99
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
nervous

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,920
What happened before

101
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,080
Let's go

102
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Welcome to the happy world

103
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,080
Have fun

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
Always smiling

105
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,600
The atmosphere of this game

106
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,080
It's pretty good, too

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,480
All of us follow the agreement

108
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Game continues

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,120
You better keep your promise

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,480
Yes

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,360
After we clear customs

112
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
Must wake up Qingyou

113
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,960
And A Yong

114
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
That's just a non-player character

115
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Shouldn't answer us

116
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
Qingyou and all this

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,840
What does it matter?

118
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,840
girl

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,480
Don't worry so much for now

120
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,320
Let’s get through this level first.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
But

122
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,480
now

123
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Please come to the stage

124
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,520
In front of the dealer box in the center

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,440
per person

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Choose a card

127
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,440
What is this?

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
Just lucky draw

129
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,920
There may be numbers on the cards

130
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,920
Corresponding to these hatch numbers

131
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,440
no

132
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,360
What are we doing in this cabin?

133
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Stop talking so much nonsense

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,920
Let’s talk about the cards

135
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,160
Doudou

136
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,240
We are next to each other

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
I'll be able to take care of you in a while

138
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,720
Players please

139
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,080
Follow selected number

140
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,840
Enter the corresponding cabin

141
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
Preparing for the game

142
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
You really got it right

143
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,080
Why don't you even explain the rules?

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,320
Maybe when we get inside the cabin

145
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,400
Only then can it speak

146
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
Everyone be careful

147
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,280
Doudou

148
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
Please pay attention to your safety too

149
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,000
So serious?

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
Eighty thousand

151
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,160
be careful

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,680
But don't be afraid

153
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,840
If anything happens, I'll cover you

154
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
Don't worry, Brother Qiang

155
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
Please pay attention to your safety too

156
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,680
Eighty thousand

157
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,000
In my room

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
Why is there a small train?

159
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,280
Brother Qiang, what are you talking about?

160
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,840
Eighty thousand

161
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,160
Yang Bawan

162
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Brother Qiang

163
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Doudou

164
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,320
I know

165
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,440
no

166
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,720
Senior

168
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,720
no

169

uncle

170
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
What's going on?

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,680
Little girl, what did you say?

172
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
I can't hear what you said

173
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,280
The game will kill me

174
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
time three minutes

175
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
game rules

176
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,880
There's a bomb in the train

177
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Fully wound

178
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,440
The train is starting

179
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,800
end of time

180
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,320
train explosion

181
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,560
Whose area do you park in?

182
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
Whoever is finished

183
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,600
What little train

184
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,560
Do you have a fire or train there?

185
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,640
fire Fire

186
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,640
If you follow the serial number

187
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,400
That train should be there

188
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,240
This clockwork

189
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,360
right

190
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,920
Use this clockwork

191
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,560
come on

192
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,000
I come first

193
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,440
calm calm calm down

194
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,960
Game starts

195
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,960
This thing has a bomb

196
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
To scare people, right?

197
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,480
rules say

198
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,040
In whose area does the train stop?

199
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,640
Whoever

200
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,320
so everyone

201
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,440
It is divided into regions

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
That is to say

203
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
As long as the small train is in the player's

204
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,440
The area exploded

205
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,560
There's a clockwork on it

206
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,240
Turned

207
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
That person will die

208
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,880
Why did it stop?

209
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,400
turn around turn

210
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,560
clockwork

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,280
Uncle Lin, what are you doing?

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,760
There really is a bomb

213
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,280
Gao Xuan

214
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,720
clockwork

215
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,320
it that

216
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,800
It seems like everyone needs to wind up

217
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,960
Only then can the little train restart

218
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,120
little girl

219
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,720
clockwork

220
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920
send clockwork

221
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,520
This

222
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
This thing won't be here with me

223
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,280
Explode

224
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,840
Wrong

225
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,400
It just said it would take three minutes

226
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,320
It's still early

227
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,200
i should be safe

228
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,720
no matter what

229
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,640
Trains will eventually explode

230
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,640
Someone will definitely die

231
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,640
Is there no solution to this game?

232
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,440
Wrong

233
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,800
There must be a way

234
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
Let everyone pass the test

235
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,560
three minutes

236
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
That's one hundred and eighty seconds

237
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
That is to say

238
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
This time is very important

239
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,440
Just calculate it

240
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,280
The train’s trajectory and destination

241
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,320
Let it explode at the designated location

242
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
It should be avoidable

243
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,640
time

244
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
To calculate time

245
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
how to calculate time

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,840
time

247
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,280
Doudou is timing

248
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,400
when timer ends

249
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,760
The train explodes immediately

250
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,440
Whose area do you park in?

251
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,760
Whoever is finished

252
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,240
Right

253
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,520
Brother Qiang is number one

254
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,800
So the little train is at his place

255
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,920
Game starts

256
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,440
nothing can be done

257
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
Can we just wait for the train to come?

258
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,400
Chunyu and Gao Xuan are both thinking of ways

259
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,720
what can i do

260
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
How can I help everyone?

261
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,440
time three minutes

262
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
no timer

263
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,280
Right

264
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,440
My normal heart rate is sixty

265
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,560
A superb swordsman

266
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
Even in a life and death duel

267
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,040
last minute

268
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,400
Also stay absolutely calm

269
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
Doudou is here

270
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
Doudou is timing

271
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,400
one two three

272
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,720
Four

273
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,080
five

274
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,080
six

275
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,160
seven

276
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,400
eight

277
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,400
Nine

278
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,120
ten

279
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,440
ten seconds

280
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,920
five seconds

281
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,640
i bounce

282
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,040
What the hell is this?

283
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,160
It can still be like this

284
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,680
Why are you still turning around?

285
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,320
What's going on

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,960
What's the matter

287
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,040
three three

288
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
It's been some time

289
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,320
It takes five seconds to wind the spring

290
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,560
Train ten seconds

291
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,880
Arrive at the next glass cabin

292
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,680
so

293
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Each running time is fifteen seconds

294
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,920
Fifteen seconds from Brother Qiang

295
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Thirty seconds to Laolin

296
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,600
forty five seconds

297
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,160
One hundred and sixty five seconds

298
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,080
One hundred and eighty seconds

299
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
Why are you back?

300
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
How long has it been now?

301
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,840
It won't explode here, right?

302
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,480
spring rain

303
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,040
spring rain

304
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,360
i bounce

305
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,760
one

306
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,080
two

307
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,640
three

308
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,040
Four

309
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,680
five

310
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,760
i bounce

311
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,520
right

312
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,760
The U-turn was delayed for five seconds

313
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,880
so

314
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,960
Come out of Doudou cabin

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,080
It's one hundred and seventy-five seconds

316
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,400
Five seconds on the road

317
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,600
This way

318
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,080
One hundred and eighty seconds

319
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,040
it's right there

320
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,800
The game is called "Blow me up to death and I'm done"

321
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
It just shouted something

322
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
i bounce

323
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,520
so

324
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
The clown is me

325
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,560
Blow up the clown before it's over

326
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
Lao Lin, hurry up

327
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,520
Lao Lin No

328
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,840
No rush

329
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,680
Come come

330
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Just twist it

331
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Just twist it

332
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,040
send send send send send

333
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,600
Don't panic Don't panic

334
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,280
What's going on with this guy?

335
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Brother Qiang

336
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,920
Don't be anxious

337
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,360
As long as it's normal

338
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,800
No one will be bombed

339
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,320
Brother Qiang

340
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,440
Brother Qiang

341
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,520
Hurry up, hurry up

342
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,320
Do it quickly

343
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,400
Why hasn’t the train started yet?

344
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,840
Brother Qiang was delayed for ten seconds.

345
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,800
Then Doudou won’t have time to twist it.

346
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,040
broken

347
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,600
If this is the case

348
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,400
The bomb will explode at Doudou's place

349
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,880
Eighty thousand

350
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,640
no time

351
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,320
The train stopped moving again

352
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,320
Yang Bawan

353
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,960
what to do

354
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
No, no, no

355
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
I absolutely cannot let Doudou die

356
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,480
everyone needs me

357
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,240
calm down

358
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,640
calm down

359
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,840
Eighty thousand

360
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,600
Yang Bawan

361
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,320
Eighty thousand

362
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Yang Bawan

363
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,680
No

364
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,320
Eighty thousand

365
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm fine

366
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,520
It's OK

367
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,080
Are you kidding me?

368
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,240
It's okay It's okay

369
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,680
It's okay, look

370
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,480
Doudou

371
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,600
Eighty thousand

372
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,440
Eighty thousand

373
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,200
Eighty thousand

374
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,200
Doudou, my name is Yang Bawan

375
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Remember to come to me

376
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,880
Eighty thousand

377
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,280
Eighty thousand

378
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,880
How

379
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
What's going on?

380
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,000
let me out

381
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,880
let me out

382
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,640
Yang Bawan

383
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
80,000 80,000 Yang 80,000

384
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,320
Yang Bawan

385
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,120
Eighty thousand

386
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,000
Eighty thousand

387
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,400
80,000, are you okay?

388
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,640
Yang Bawan

389
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,760
Yang Bawan

390
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,080
Eighty thousand. Nothing can happen to you. Eighty thousand.

391
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,840
Yang Bawan

392
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,880
Yang Bawan

393
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,120
Yang Bawan

394
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,200
Stop being hypocritical

395
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,760
If it weren't for you wasting time

396
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,000
Something will happen to 80,000 yuan

397
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Why do you rely on me?

398
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,600
Why do you rely on me?

399
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,400
Then Yang Bawan isn’t it?

400
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,560
I went down to save you.

401
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,920
You are still justified in harming others.

402
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,480
Doudou Doudou

403
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,000
No it's not

404
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,480
Don’t you understand yet?

405
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
If no one wastes time

406
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,800
No one will die

407
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,960
if

408
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,080
each of us

409
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,360
All are normal operations

410
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,000
After the timer ends

411
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,240
The little train will be here

412
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,760
In that case

413
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,560
The one who was killed was the clown.

414
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,400
Everyone

415
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,360
The broadcast hasn’t said yet

416
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,440
game is over

417
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,600
Actually this game is very simple

418
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,400
As long as we trust each other

419
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,880
You will definitely be able to pass the test

420
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,040
what we have to do

421
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Just face it calmly

422
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,040
Don't make mistakes

423
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,280
Please come to the dealing box

424
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,440
Continue to choose cards

425
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,320
Enter the cabin

426
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,600
Preparing for round two

427
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,000
Still want to play

428
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,680
if we don't continue

429
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,200
I can't save those other people

430
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,560
We can't leave ourselves

431
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,320
Brother Qiang

432
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,960
Take the cards

433
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,240
clown

434
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,080
So wait for the little train

435
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,520
As long as it's here with the clown

436
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,360
If it explodes

437
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,720
We will all be safe

438
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,640
Really? Chunyu

439
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,520
The game will kill me

440
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,560
second round

441
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,720
time one hundred seconds

442
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,840
game rules

443
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
blow me up

444
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,960
Players who failed in the first round were rescued

445
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,400
Everyone clears the level

446
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,880
Can't blow me up

447
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,640
Players who failed in two rounds

448
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,240
Enter the elimination house together

449
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,040
Make the ultimate elimination

450
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,640
The winner passes the level with other players

451
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,640
Eighty thousand people are not dead

452
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,720
As long as we blow up the clown

453
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,760
can save him

454
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,760
Eighty-eighty thousand can still be saved.

455
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,080
Is it possible to save 80,000 yuan?

456
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
Game starts

457
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,240
ten seconds

458
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,480
The small train comes out of cabin No. 7

459
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,080
ten seconds

460
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,240
Spring rain arrives in twenty-five seconds

461
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,360
From Doudou to Wenya in forty seconds

462
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,840
Finally at exactly one hundred seconds

463
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,680
The small train enters cabin No. 7

464
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,600
explode

465
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,520
Why is it only eight seconds?

466
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,880
The time has advanced

467
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,600
eight seconds

468
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
No matter what

469
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,120
i am safe

470
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,320
i am safe

471
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,760
i am safe

472
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,280
The train is getting faster

473
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,880
Why are you here so quickly?

474
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,400
Doudou Doudou

475
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
You can't mess up

476
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,000
Doudou

477
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,280
Doudou, my name is Yang Bawan

478
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
Remember to come to me

479
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,200
she is so special

480
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,200
a girl

481
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
so brave

482
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,240
So powerful

483
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
so what

484
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,200
I'm really looking forward to it in the game

485
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,320
meet her again

486
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,840
The train is getting faster

487
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,400
Can't predict

488
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,080
There's no way we can blow up the Joker

489
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,120
The train is faster now

490
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,800
Even if we cooperate well

491
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,440
where the last bomb went off

492
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
It won’t be Cabin No. 7

493
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,040
And it's probably

494
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,160
Doudou, don’t panic

495
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,080
I can't count

496
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,840
What should I do?

497
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,320
Can't blow me up

498
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,400
two wheel player

499
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,800
Enter the elimination house together

500
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,920
Make the ultimate elimination

501
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,960
It seems that there is a turning point in the elimination room.

502
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,200
I must find a way

503
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,720
Save 80,000 people

504
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,520
I'm going to save 80,000

505
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,120
Brother Qiang

506
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,080
Brother Qiang

507
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,560
what are you doing

508
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,320
Brother Qiang

509
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,480
Hold on tight

510
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,640
time is coming

511
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,400
Brother Qiang, what are you doing?

512
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,000
Twist the clockwork A Qiang

513
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,000
Please stop hurting others, okay?

514
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,680
Your brother is interesting enough

515
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,000
from now on

516
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,720
I, Zhang Tianqiang, am your eldest brother

517
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,200
Then you are in the game

518
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,040
You have to cover me

519
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,400
As long as I'm here

520
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,520
You are definitely here

521
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,720
my brother

522
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,560
I'll save it myself

523
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
time is up

524
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,280
This strong brother

525
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,440
Although it looks bad

526
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,080
I didn't expect the last one

527
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Quite handsome

528
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,600
I don’t know what they will do next

529
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,360
What will happen

530
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,520
I hope they both

531
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,400
Is everything okay?

532
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,400
But he said this is the ultimate elimination

533
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,520
that is to say

534
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,440
both of them

535
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
only one person can
