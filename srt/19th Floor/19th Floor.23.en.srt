1
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,612
Mom

2
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,681
I'm here to see you

3
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,444
you say

4
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,147
Why

5
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,049
beautiful things

6
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,283
It’s all so short

7
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,892
I remember we used to be like

8
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,429
It was a good time too

9
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,433
I think that time

10
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,368
He should love us

11
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,441
But why after arriving in Jiangning?

12
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,011
Everything is different

13
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,081
You said you leave early and come back late every day

14
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,249
My wife doesn't care

15
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,350
Don't care about the child

16
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,118
dad

17
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:14,887
dad

18
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,756
You have to come back early

19
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:22,996
I'll try my best

20
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,640
happy birthday to you

21
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,643
happy birthday to you

22
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,146
happy birthday to you

23
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,449
happy birthday to you

24
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,252
Make a wish quickly

25
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,389
I hope my birthday will be next year

26
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,291
Dad can spend time with me

27
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,528
Silly boy

28
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,997
If you say this wish, it won't work.

29
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,432
If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.

30
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,534
If he doesn't come back, we'll live the same life

31
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,068
right

32
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,803
Chunyu cutting cake

33
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,605
Come

34
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,276
after you left

35
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,047
Although I am very angry with him

36
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,650
I deliberately got low marks

37
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,253
I ignored him on purpose

38
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,156
Just because in my heart

39
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,991
Always have some expectations

40
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:25,892
I think

41
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,263
I think he can change back

42
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,834
but now i know

43
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,603
impossible

44
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,775
He has lost his mind

45
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,350
I'm sorry, Mom

46
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,855
I shouldn't have told you this

47
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,164
because i know

48
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,603
Even if the world has changed

49
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,276
you won't change

50
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,515
I often think

51
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,688
if you are still here

52
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,029
You will definitely love me and love me

53
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,131
right?

54
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,536
Mom

55
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,810
I'm really tired

56
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,471
Chunyu where are you

57
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,041
spring rain

58
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,476
Let's meet and chat, shall we?

59
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,514
spring rain

60
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:12,959
Uncle Lin

61
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,627
Can we go in and talk?

62
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,830
Of course, please come in

63
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,343
Uncle Lin, you can sit wherever you like

64
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,720
Uncle Lin, please drink a glass of water first

65
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:44,790
Uncle Lin

66
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:45,791
how do you know

67
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,692
I live here

68
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,327
This matter is not important

69
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,228
What's important

70
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,130
What I'm going to tell you now

71
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,132
OK

72
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:53,933
you said

73
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,804
It's time for you to know everything

74
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,642
actually

75
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,612
I am Mazzolini

76
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,389
This way

77
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,424
Come

78
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,893
Everything is there

79
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,096
It seems that according to the picture

80
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,598
It is easy for deviations to occur

81
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,000
I was too careless

82
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,684
How about we leave first?

83
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,519
give them some space

84
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,388
I am becoming more and more discerning.

85
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:30,923
This is not Master Xiaoqin

86
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:31,791
Well trained

87
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,171
all day today

88
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,405
I haven't seen you

89
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,040
Are you okay?

90
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,412
It's OK

91
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,681
I

92
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,784
I went to see my mother

93
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,525
spring rain

94
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,994
Wait until I clear the customs today

95
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,730
I'll tell you again

96
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,064
ok

97
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,936
tell me what

98
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:19,872
Mazzolini

99
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,073
I

100
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,442
And everything I know

101
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,324
Xiaoqin

102
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,425
How

103
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,827
I look better in the game

104
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,729
I don't look good in reality

105
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,331
No no no no no

106
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,032
you are in the game

107
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,267
Looks as good as in reality

108
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,835
So beautiful and brave

109
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,936
Still so upright

110
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,571
And they are all very nice to me

111
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,673
Everything else is correct

112
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,474
The last one is wrong

113
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,511
What is this?

114
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,248
careful

115
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:37,950
Are your legs okay?

116
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:40,586
I'm fine

117
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,054
You, you go first

118
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,122
I follow slowly

119
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,991
Then I'll go and take a look first

120
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,493
I'll come find you soon

121
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,928
Pay attention to yourself

122
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:49,895
Um

123
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,504
spring rain

124
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,311
spring rain

125
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,155
spring rain

126
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,959
spring rain

127
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,451
spring rain

128
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,256
you have grown up

129
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,504
Mom

130
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,044
I miss you so much

131
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,049
mother

132
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,785
Miss you too

133
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,722
It's okay now

134
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,959
everything is over

135
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,229
you

136
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,797
I

137
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,165
And dad

138
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,401
our family

139
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,636
can be together well

140
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,673
from now on

141
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,842
never separate again

142
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,628
Silly boy

143
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,730
Yes or no

144
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,333
I'm angry with my dad again

145
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,235
don't be angry

146
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:12,638
your dad

147
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,608
He is the one who loves you the most and loves you the most

148
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,211
This point

149
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,247
He has never changed

150
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,655
He is not

151
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,466
Mom

152
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,574
I know

153
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,878
you are fake

154
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,452
my mother has

155
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,989
Been gone for a long time

156
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,027
Silly boy

157
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,414
Isn't this just a moth?

158
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,615
don't you think

159
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,050
It's much bigger than an ordinary moth

160
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,684
what happened

161
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,319
She said there are moths here

162
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,689
When we first came in

163
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,323
In the air raid shelter

164
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,358
I've seen similar moths too

165
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,893
I guess it has to do with customs clearance conditions

166
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:41,527
yes

167
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:42,995
Probably

168
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:43,762
right

169
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,164
Where is the spring rain?

170
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,433
She's behind. Come right away.

171
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:48,600
why didn't you

172
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,601
Be with her

173
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,136
So dangerous now

174
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,371
I'll go find her

175
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,609
spring rain

176
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,248
spring rain

177
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:06,919
spring rain

178
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,824
spring rain

179
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,528
spring rain

180
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,531
spring rain

181
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:23,936
I'll go over there

182
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,608
Follow Uncle Lin and don't let anything happen.

183
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:30,576
Walk

184
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,545
You wait for me

185
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:50,729
spring rain

186
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:55,968
Dangerous

187
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,604
spring rain

188
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:03,809
spring rain

189
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,286
spring rain

190
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,587
spring rain

191
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,156
spring rain

192
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,291
spring rain

193
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
Chunyu, it’s okay, it’s okay

194
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:23,929
don't be afraid

195
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:24,930
I am here

196
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:25,931
I am here

197
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,234
Not afraid

198
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,170
It's okay

199
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,315
I know

200
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:44,750
all the time

201
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,851
you have suffered a lot

202
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:48,954
But don't worry

203
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,390
I will always be by your side

204
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,495
Not afraid

205
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:58,864
Not afraid

206
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,037
no matter what happens

207
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,039
I won't give up on you

208
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,613
But please

209
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,082
Never give up on yourself

210
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:18,951
OK

211
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,336
What's good

212
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,643
So romantic and touching

213
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,613
But what's the point?

214
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,050
He said he would never give up on you

215
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,719
Do you believe it? Chunyu

216
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,653
shut up

217
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,123
Are you feeling guilty?

218
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,959
He didn't even believe what he said

219
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,028
why do you believe

220
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,363
What nonsense like this?

221
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,465
in this world

222
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,867
Emotions for geniuses

223
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,170
It's an airtight wall

224
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,472
the only thing that can be done

225
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,840
Just to trap you

226
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,176
what is the most important

227
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,645
it's you

228
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,346
is freedom

229
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,950
You who are not bound by love and love

230
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,985
Is the real self

231
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,589
Just take me and your mother as an example.

232
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,426
I was trapped by her back then

233
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,494
a long time

234
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
But one day

235
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,598
I am free

236
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,439
Do you know what day it is?

237
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,874
I told you to shut up

238
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,609
on that day

239
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,210
that afternoon

240
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,047
It's pouring rain

241
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,748
You are also in the car

242
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,451
哢哓哢哓

243
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,086
thunder and lightning

244
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,156
The car is roaring in Mercedes Benz

245
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:05,390
Sudden

246
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,358
bang

247
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:10,929
the whole world

248
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,664
suddenly became quiet

249
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,333
at this moment

250
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,635
That bondage

251
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,004
That blocked me for many years

252
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,706
airtight wall

253
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,641
it disappeared

254
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,844
I got a new life

255
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:32,951
spring rain

256
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,086
spring rain

257
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,153
Don't listen to his nonsense

258
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:36,855
he is lying

259
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,323
he is lying

260
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,831
That day is still your birthday

261
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,232
Right, Chunyu?

262
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,491
spring rain spring rain

263
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:17,829
spring rain

264
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:18,930
spring rain

265
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:19,865
spring rain

266
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:21,600
spring rain

267
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,503
spring rain

268
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,199
spring rain

269
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,000
spring rain

270
00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,704
spring rain

271
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,206
spring rain

272
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,041
This is not the real you

273
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,276
you are angry now

274
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,110
Also very helpless

275
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,745
But you must never give up on yourself

276
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,647
Because all this is an illusion

277
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,150
spring rain

278
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,885
Chunyu, stop

279
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,753
stop

280
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:18,657
spring rain

281
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,225
Chunyu, stop

282
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,626
stop stop

283
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,564
why stop

284
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,966
you are already free

285
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:28,633
spring rain

286
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:29,534
look

287
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,904
The light is ahead

288
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,041
Isn't this exactly

289
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,976
Is it a goal you want to chase?

290
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,149
spring rain

291
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,284
Go forward

292
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,187
Freedom is at hand

293
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,728
Don't listen to his nonsense

294
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,063
What he said

295
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,364
Things about your father

296
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,765
It's all lies

297
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,567
It's not a lie at all

298
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,370
The truth is often cruel

299
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,838
No one wants to hear it

300
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,807
But the fact is the fact

301
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,208
cannot be changed

302
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,109
Don't listen to him

303
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,211
What is your father thinking?

304
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,446
He doesn't know at all

305
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,281
I don't know who knows

306
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,249
spring rain

307
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,984
You have to make your own judgment

308
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,552
Don't listen to his noise

309
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,253
shut up

310
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,354
you know nothing

311
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,655
But I know

312
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,690
I know everything kid

313
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,758
I know everything

314
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,559
Everything

315
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,627
I still remember it all

316
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,128
I remember it all vividly, child

317
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,363
Because

318
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:37,469
Lao Gao

319
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,070
This door can't be opened

320
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,272
What to do now

321
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,439
We can't get in

322
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,007
do not know either

323
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:42,908
How's the situation inside?

324
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,013
Let's not be anxious first

325
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,416
I believe as long as Uncle Lin is inside

326
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,584
Chunyu will be fine

327
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:53,752
Uncle Lin

328
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,320
what do you mean

329
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,027
In fact, Uncle Lin in the game

330
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,229
It's not that we are in school

331
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,463
The Uncle Lin I know

332
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,666
Then he is

333
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,335
He is from Chunyu

334
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,304
I'm dad

335
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,373
I am the father, child

336
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,908
I am the father, child

337
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,763
How can you really make it up?

338
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,967
Everyone started talking nonsense

339
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,134
spring rain

340
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,770
This old man is obviously lying to you.

341
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,272
If he weren't Lao Lin

342
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,307
Why didn't you tell me sooner or later?

343
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,675
Just say it now

344
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,910
I didn't lie to you, kid.

345
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,645
I'm just stuck

346
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,479
In Lao Lin’s body

347
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,880
I don't dare to reveal my identity

348
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,082
That's to protect you

349
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,317
Continue editing

350
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,453
really want to protect you

351
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,721
Why do I still let you

352
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,055
Play this game

353
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,991
You believe me kid

354
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,026
your date of birth is

355
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,828
June 5th

356
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:11,696
the day you were born

357
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,998
It rained a little

358
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,065
so your mother

359
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,367
I’ll name you Chunyu

360
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,068
and

361
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,937
Your mother's name is Zhou Xiaoting

362
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:19,804
we later

363
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,473
We returned to Jiangning together

364
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,109
Okay, Okay, Okay

365
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,012
Even if you are Chun Yiming

366
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,547
Is everything I said wrong?

367
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,683
Why did you suddenly

368
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,651
became one

369
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,519
A good father who loves his daughter

370
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,322
what have you done before

371
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,657
Have you forgotten?

372
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,825
Why did you return to Jiangning in the first place?

373
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,827
Is it really for

374
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,596
Will Chunyu reunite with her grandma?

375
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,464
It's not all for yourself

376
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,599
You bastard

377
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,370
everything that happened after

378
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,672
Including the death of Chunyu’s mother

379
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,573
Doesn't it have anything to do with you?

380
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,107
child

381
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:57,709
spring rain

382
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,010
He lied to you

383
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,312
Haven't you lied to your mother enough?

384
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,953
spring rain

385
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,189
you're free

386
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,429
spring rain

387
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,371
Hold on tight, kid.

388
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:01,906
I pull you up

389
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,612
I beg you

390
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,647
You let my daughter go

391
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,483
What's wrong with you?

392
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,251
Don't hurt her, okay?

393
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,185
I beg you

394
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,253
I beg you

395
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,123
Moths always fly to the flame

396
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,291
Because she has been mothed

397
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,159
Boarded

398
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,629
She can't hear anything you say

399
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,030
How can I save her?

400
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:26,998
I beg you

401
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:27,665
I beg you

402
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,434
Tell me how to save her

403
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,271
Hold on kid

404
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,572
It's actually very simple

405
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,809
As long as the moth is still on her

406
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,644
No one can stop her

407
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,246
unless

408
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:43,948
Unless a moth

409
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,683
transfer host

410
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,438
Hold on

411
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,407
Dad pull you up

412
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,276
hold on

413
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,360
child

414
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,162
I'm sorry for your mother

415
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,131
sorry for you

416
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,535
I can't undo what happened in the past

417
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,505
But I hope you will

418
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,974
It must be good

419
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,131
Uncle Lin

420
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,920
dad

421
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:20,932
Yan Mingliang

422
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,334
You deliberately pretended to be Uncle Chun

423
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,637
That's right

424
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,040
This is all my plan

425
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:30,975
Anyway congratulations

426
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,443
Passed successfully

427
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,082
spring rain

428
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,144
spring rain

429
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,280
you're awake

430
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,252
Come on, slow down

431
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,055
careful

432
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:26,931
where is this

433
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,233
This is what the New Year gives us

434
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,168
Find a safe house

435
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,269
secret person

436
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,270
Don't know here

437
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,707
How long have I been unconscious?

438
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,644
in the morning

439
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,212
Nan Xiaoqin and Xu Wenya

440
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,213
Out of the game

441
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,214
they found

442
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,248
You have been unconscious

443
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,349
Then contacted me

444
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,385
President Nian arranged this place

445
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:50,988
Don't think too much

446
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,123
Just wake up

447
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,324
Let me get you a glass of water

448
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,732
Uncle Lin and Chun Yiming

449
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,069
What's going on

450
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,393
Have a drink first

451
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,076
I just found out too

452
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,877
all the truth

453
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,547
yesterday afternoon

454
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,150
Uncle Lin suddenly ran over to me

455
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:55,753
Uncle Lin

456
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,224
It's time for you to know everything

457
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:02,793
actually

458
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,664
I am Mazzolini

459
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,870
You are Mazzolini

460
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,839
I am also Chun Yiming

461
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,807
Chunyu's father

462
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,014
After the car accident

463
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,750
The relationship between our father and daughter

464
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,985
A big problem occurred

465
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,922
I try to relax

466
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,690
want to get close to her

467
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,527
But it pains me so much

468
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,663
What's more, I'm helpless

469
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,566
Chunyu ignored me at all

470
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,869
She doesn't argue with me either

471
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:46,971
just ignore me

472
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,273
just like

473
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,443
My father

474
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,045
It's like it doesn't exist at all

475
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:58,950
Mom

476
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:01,986
spring rain

477
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,721
let me see you

478
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:05,489
Mom

479
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,391
This is bought for you

480
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,693
Ginseng protein powder

481
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,794
Very good

482
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:12,863
spring rain

483
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,733
This is your favorite food

484
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,767
Tiramisu

485
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,111
spring rain

486
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:27,912
Your class teacher

487
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,679
Called me

488
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,514
Tell me about your recent results

489
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,049
The decline is abnormal.

490
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,121
Dad knows

491
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,757
There are some things in your heart that you can't handle

492
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,192
But

493
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,129
Dad is talking to you

494
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,598
Can you please stop playing games?

495
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:50,601
spring rain

496
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:52,903
give me

497
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,038
spring rain

498
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:55,606
Get away from me

499
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,074
Spread the spring rain

500
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,643
Let go, let go

501
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,910
Let go or not let you go

502
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,716
A child without a mother is already pitiful

503
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,318
Let's play some games. What's up?

504
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,120
I tell you

505
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,988
This is not your lab

506
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,256
child

507
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,492
Nor is it your instrument.

508
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,626
jars

509
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,065
because of spring rain

510
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,767
He has been unwilling to communicate with me

511
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,670
Then I thought about it

512
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,705
Using brain-computer interface technology

513
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,240
to make a game

514
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,109
Maybe I can

515
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,611
Communicated with Chunyu

516
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,281
half year ago

517
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,549
we are done

518
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,117
All preparations

519
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,553
test day

520
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,721
Yan Mingliang

521
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,289
you've already seen it

522
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,425
He is a project investor

523
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,427
Also a technical partner

524
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,529
That day at his home

525
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,830
Something big happened

526
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,265
But he still

527
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,833
Arrived at the laboratory on time

528
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,601
test

529
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,234
bright

530
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,373
How about we

531
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,874
Stop for a moment

532
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,275
Why

533
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,477
Something went wrong at your house

534
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,411
Such a big thing

535
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,046
It's better to take a rest first.

536
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,081
Old spring

537
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,816
There is only work now

538
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,085
Can make me forget the pain temporarily

539
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,887
Let's go

540
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,590
You have to keep walking on the road

541
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,158
Then slow down

542
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,559
Beware of danger

543
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:56,794
It's OK

544
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,163
fear and danger now

545
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,165
That's what we need most

546
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,238
bright

547
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,144
Lao Chun Lao Chun

548
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,085
Laochun

549
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:22,386
Laochun

550
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:23,854
Wake up, Lao Chun

551
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,125
How is it possible?

552
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,062
This is a virtual world

553
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,132
How could he be in a coma?

554
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,143
Lao Chun Lao Chun

555
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:46,811

556
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,078
Chief Engineer Chief Engineer

557
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:48,946
Hit 120 quickly. Hurry up.

558
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:50,347
no no no

559
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:51,115
Wait first

560
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,250
chief engineer

561
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,285
chief engineer

562
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:07,865
Laochun

563
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,102
woke up

564
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,238
Chief Engineer, are you okay?

565
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,208
Are you okay?

566
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,211
Laochun

567
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,714
Was I in the system just now?

568
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:24,615
Comatose

569
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,687
How could this happen?

570
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,089
At the moment when I fell into the water just now

571
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,524
Because of extreme fright

572
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,825
you are in the game

573
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,528
briefly lost consciousness

574
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,033
This is a big loophole

575
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,602
yes

576
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,405
The experiment must be suspended

577
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,074
Let’s put this question first

578
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:50,841
Let’s talk about it after it’s solved

579
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,042
right

580
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,911
Show me the data just now

581
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,079
In case something goes wrong

582
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:55,913
But what to do?

583
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,651
It was at that time that Yan Mingliang

584
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,753
started his plan
