1
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,624
this is a

2
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,925
Works that transcend the times

3
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,961
is a perfect virtual

4
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,296
But extremely real

5
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,932
It’s the excitement beyond the limit

6
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,468
It’s an unprecedented free world

7
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:16,536
This

8
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,005
That's the nineteenth floor

9
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,410
It is made up of countless

10
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,012
Thrilling levels

11
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,348
Infinite streaming game

12
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,983
all players

13
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,652
Break through the levels under unified rules

14
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,087
very fair

15
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,421
very free

16
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,390
Colleagues

17
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,925
Our nineteenth floor

18
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,028
It will definitely become history

19
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
in front of the people who made history

20
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,701
Those ordinary people who do nothing

21
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,369
can only be used as

22
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,771
Background board on his road to success

23
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,574
so

24
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,544
on your path to achievement

25
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,212
Me and my mother

26
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,580
It's just a background board, right?

27
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,286
I ask you

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,054
Do you remember

29
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,657
When we were still in Bei'an

30
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,058
You come back from get off work

31
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,627
my mother

32
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,663
My mother made it for you

33
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,031
My favorite black chicken soup

34
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,067
You also brought her a bouquet of flowers

35
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,104
Excuse me

36
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,840
Maybe too much time has passed

37
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,343
I don't quite remember

38
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,211
It doesn’t matter

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
I remember

40
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,618
Because it was that day

41
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,486
you said

42
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,988
What happened when you signed the contract successfully?

43
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,656
That was that day

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,792
You said we were moving

45
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,260
You also said

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,264
What do you think is most important

47
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,832
It's our family together

48
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,736
That moment I really saw you

49
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,071
There is joy in the eyes

50
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,406
I really thought

51
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,775
you are right to us

52
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,777
The family's future is full of expectations

53
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,646
but you are just right

54
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,214
Your own future is full of expectations

55
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,249
without us

56
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:10,650
right

57
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,085
spring rain

58
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,453
you are still young

59
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,588
There are some things you don't understand

60
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,856
for my mother's death

61
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,225
Aren't you a little ashamed?

62
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,493
It's all over

63
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,728
Don't mention it again

64
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,696
But it can't get through here

65
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,232
Don't dwell on the past

66
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,271
You are my daughter Chun Yiming

67
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,373
You are not one of those ordinary people

68
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,807
I tried my best

69
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,409
Let you enter the game

70
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,245
Isn’t it because I hope you can clear the level as soon as possible?

71
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,546
become a new world

72
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,848
The first hero?

73
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,650
only this

74
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,852
Only then can you truly understand me

75
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:46,986
only this

76
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,054
Only then can you continue

77
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,022
My great achievements

78
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,189
Chun Yiming

79
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,626
you're crazy you know that

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,895
I don't want to hear it anymore

81
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,063
You are talking nonsense

82
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,432
For your great achievements

83
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,067
I'm not interested at all

84
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,202
my whole life

85
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,171
will not become

86
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,205
people like you

87
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,978
time has come

88
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,847
Your friends are already in

89
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,084
You can only move forward now

90
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,298
Why

91
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,167
why do you do this to me

92
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:36,969
spring rain

93
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:38,371
you

94
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,273
What happened to you

95
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,009
do you really not know

96
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:44,944
I

97
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,813
What do I know?

98
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,349
who is mazzolini

99
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,617
What are you doing with him?

100
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,052
You say it

101
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,262
spring rain me

102
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,130
spring rain

103
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,367
I gonna go see

104
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,711
What's going on with you two?

105
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,296
spring rain

106
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,732
Are your legs feeling better?

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,567
It's okay

108
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,969
I'll just take a break

109
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,374
You and that Gao Xuan

110
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,542
What happened

111
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,613
It has nothing to do with him

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,349
what is that

113
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,161
Uncle Lin

114
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,630
Let me ask you a question

115
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,100
you say

116
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,703
You said you would do it for yourself

117
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,405
Don't you care about your daughter at all?

118
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,509
Before I had a daughter

119
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,144
Maybe

120
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,580
But now

121
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,683
I work outside all year round

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,851
Rarely go home

123
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,387
in my daughter's opinion

124
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,823
I just want to make money

125
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,858
save money

126
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,693
But actually

127
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,563
Everything I do is for her

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,201
never mind

129
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,803
The situation is different

130
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,405
In fact, they are all the same

131
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,008
Father for his daughter

132
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,710
anything can be done

133
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,981
Maybe this father

134
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,283
Just not good at communication

135
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,285
And daughter

136
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,888
also for some reasons

137
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,624
Maybe you misunderstood your father?

138
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,930
I don't think there's any misunderstanding

139
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,298
On the contrary

140
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,867
The more I get to know him, the more I

141
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:31,577
Lao Gao

142
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:32,979
Let me tell you

143
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,413
Sometimes people get along with each other

144
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,615
Still need space

145
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,250
You have to learn to give in

146
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,218
What do you know?

147
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,853
If you don’t know the situation, don’t talk nonsense.

148
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,259
I just care about it

149
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,097
Chunyu, what’s wrong with you, Chunyu?

150
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,332
spring rain

151
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:56,702
spring rain

152
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:00,573
spring rain

153
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:01,641
Where are the people?

154
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,309
Yes

155
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,244
I just heard the sound, it's obviously not far away

156
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,812
I came over and saw no one.

157
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:08,881
spring rain

158
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,216
Over there

159
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,253
spring rain

160
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,390
Chunyu, what’s wrong with you?

161
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,190
spring rain

162
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,191
spring rain

163
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:19,926
spring rain

164
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,128
spring rain

165
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,297
What's wrong, Chunyu?

166
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,364
spring rain

167
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,500
spring rain

168
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,139
Wrong

169
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:37,977
broken

170
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,853
It's been so long

171
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,488
Why haven't they followed?

172
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,823
Let's go back and have a look

173
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,729
Come on, I'll help you

174
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,530
It's OK

175
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,631
It's okay It's okay

176
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,298
I help you

177
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,044
Lao Gao

178
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,412
What is this for?

179
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:14,880
What else can you do?

180
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,082
The game is about to begin

181
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:17,984
But

182
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,652
So dark

183
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,853
How to start?

184
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,824
possible

185
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,192
This is the one who wants to be in

186
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,860
A game played in the dark

187
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,630
That that

188
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,264
We've been here for half a day now

189
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,933
There was no movement at all.

190
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,442
Where are they?

191
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,379
Maybe over there

192
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,647
Let's go over and have a look

193
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,214
Come

194
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,751
Lao Gao

195
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,085
What on earth do you want to do?

196
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:53,919
Use your strongest brain

197
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,820
Think about it

198
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:07,833
may be waiting

199
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,735
But what are you waiting for?

200
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,348
Waiting for an opportunity to start

201
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,485
The game begins

202
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,366
Eighty thousand

203
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:17,937
Xiaoqin

204
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:19,972
elegant

205
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,614
What's wrong, Lao Gao?

206
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,483
Is there anything strange about this mirror?

207
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,151
This is a one-way mirror

208
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,819
There should be another room opposite

209
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,455
They can't see or hear

210
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,228
This

211
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,696
We can't see the other side

212
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,964
But the other side

213
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,132
should be able to see us

214
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,700
Then just follow that

215
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,502
Interrogating prisoners in the detention center

216
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,503
Is it the same as the control room?

217
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,270
That's right

218
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,071
But

219
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,506
Who will be on the other side?

220
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,141
Needless to say?

221
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,408
It must be Yan Mingliang

222
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,576
Not necessarily him

223
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,444
He is usually there

224
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,612
Monitoring us from outside the system

225
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,946
No need to come in

226
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:01,881
Not necessarily

227
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,815
A pervert like him

228
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,749
Maybe he likes this

229
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,050
It feels like being there

230
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:09,588
Uncle Lin

231
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,524
Is it poison gas?

232
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:13,959
Probably not

233
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,297
What's going on?

234
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,865
Why do you feel a little cold?

235
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,606
It seems a little cold

236
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,378
Is this air conditioning?

237
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,123
Is this a thermometer?

238
00:13:59,104 --> 00:13:59,939
It's air conditioner

239
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,208
Their room seems to be cooling down

240
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,243
no response

241
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,283
Oh my God, this can't work. This, this, this.

242
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,952
It's too cold

243
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,256
This won't work. This won't work. This, this, this.

244
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,657
It's a little too cold for this

245
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,561
We have to find a way to save them quickly

246
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:23,929
Uncle Lin

247
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,071
Xiaoqin

248
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,206
How about I give you a hug?

249
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,343
This will make it less cold

250
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,447
Eighty thousand

251
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,652
If this is a game

252
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,487
All the spaces in the game

253
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,089
All are provided to players

254
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:51,991
Then the players of this game

255
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,025
Isn't it just us?

256
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,364
you mean

257
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,566
The people opposite are Chunyu and Lao Lin

258
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,211
spring rain

259
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,615
Spring Rain Uncle Lin

260
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,616
You guys think of a solution first

261
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,051
Get us out

262
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,252
spring rain

263
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,620
can you see

264
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,123
If you could see it

265
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,591
Let's turn off the air conditioner first.

266
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,493
Otherwise it would be too cold

267
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,229
don't worry

268
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,530
I'm here to save you now

269
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,765
Useless

270
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,900
they can't hear

271
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,007
who are you

272
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:09,969
Senior

273
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,904
Is something wrong?

274
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,641
if they both were inside

275
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,176
No response to us for a long time

276
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:18,944
Maybe they're there

277
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,045
Worse than here

278
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,057
You let them go

279
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,492
Come to me if something happens

280
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,960
you are right

281
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,063
This level is just for you

282
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,100
I want to clear the level and save them

283
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,735
There is only one way

284
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,004
what

285
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,372
very simple

286
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,307
Just take the last round

287
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,742
Finished things not done

288
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,012
Tell me what's on your mind

289
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,415
Who do you hate the most?

290
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,983
It's that simple

291
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:58,817
right

292
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,020
It couldn't be simpler

293
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,188
Come on let's talk

294
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,068
Eighty thousand

295
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,012
can you ok

296
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,166
spring rain

297
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,168
Will come to save us?

298
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:50,736
Yes

299
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:04,616
Xiaoqin

300
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,586
I have something to tell you

301
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:08,854
shut up

302
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,056
don't say anything

303
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,858
Talk about it later

304
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,126
I

305
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,495
I'm afraid

306
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,232
There will be no chance in the future

307
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:20,933
will not

308
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,535
spring rain

309
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,205
He will definitely save us

310
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:27,973
right

311
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,944
Definitely will

312
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,385
Say it quickly

313
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,488
Who provoked you?

314
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,990
Who has caused you psychological shadow?

315
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,392
who is good to you

316
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,827
He treats you badly

317
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,295
who do you love him

318
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,864
He hurt you

319
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,000
Who hates you deeply?

320
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,803
Isn't this question very simple?

321
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,072
Why can't I say it?

322
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,529
why do you

323
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,963
We are always told to talk about the people we hate

324
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,465
Is this so important?

325
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,200
Of course it's important

326
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,770
Rules are the first priority here

327
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,138
The process to follow

328
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,673
You must finish

329
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,842
Since it's us who don't follow the rules

330
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,710
Just punish us directly

331
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,812
Don't say whether these are available or not

332
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,281
No way

333
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,550
this is the rule

334
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,986
You two, stop dawdling.

335
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,621
Put it off any longer

336
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,023
them

337
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,524
It really doesn’t work anymore

338
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:54,893
No

339
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,361
Not like this

340
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,163
In fact, the rules are in your heart

341
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,498
It doesn't matter at all, right?

342
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,867
What exactly is your purpose?

343
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,502
What do you want to do?

344
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,807
i do it all

345
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,143
all for you

346
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,546
good for me

347
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,247
spring rain

348
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,415
Don't listen to him

349
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,050
Of course I do it for you

350
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,819
Because you have to cut it all off

351
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,789
What to hate or not to hate

352
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,290
None of it matters

353
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,892
more importantly

354
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,428
You have to be the best version of yourself

355
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,263
spring rain

356
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,831
why are you wasting

357
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,099
own talents

358
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,567
You retaliate against me like this

359
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,269
What's the point?

360
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,607
Isn’t it because your mother is dead?

361
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,242
Isn't it just that I had something to do that day?

362
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,977
Didn't you go to your birthday?

363
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,245
why do you insist

364
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,180
Hold on to it tightly and won't let go

365
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,051
I tell you

366
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,256
All love, hate and joy are just clouds

367
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,291
You must cut them off

368
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,527
Only then can you gain true freedom

369
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,029
only this

370
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:05,631
Only you can

371
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,266
Passed the 19th floor smoothly

372
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,500
only this

373
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,503
Only then can you live a good life

374
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,808
How much loss did I suffer back then?

375
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,243
I just know these truths

376
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,811
I just want you now

377
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,146
Avoid detours

378
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,216
Why don’t you understand? Chunyu

379
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,309
in your heart

380
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,378
Only yourself is the most important

381
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,981
It doesn't matter to anyone else, right?

382
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,451
Isn’t what you said nonsense?

383
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,219
What else is there than myself

384
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,321
What's more important

385
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,856
How about your friend

386
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,525
where is your family

387
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,659
Those that are good to you

388
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,660
Where is the person who loves you?

389
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,095
Aren't they all important?

390
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,696
spring rain

391
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:11,530
He is not you

392
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,497
do you know

393
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,901
The day of the car accident

394
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,870
what happened

395
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,340
why did you break your promise

396
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,908
Didn't you promise me

397
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,509
Will you come anyway?

398
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,978
Yes, everything about you is important

399
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:28,413
Children are not important

400
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,548
me to you

401
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,982
It's even less important, right?

402
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,369
mother

403
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,870
Where are we going?

404
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,507
mother

405
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,608
Don't cry

406
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,377
shall we go home

407
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,348
spring rain

408
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,084
Mom, I'm sorry

409
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,053
It was all my mother's fault just now

410
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,058
Dad is too busy

411
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,861
He didn't come to your birthday

412
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,529
There must be a reason

413
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,464
Don't blame him

414
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,601
your dad

415
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,604
is the best dad in the world

416
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,672
he loves you

417
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,641
love mom too

418
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,943
he is us

419
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,212
most important family

420
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,415
I know

421
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,453
let's go home

422
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,004
do you know

423
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,506
She told me

424
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,707
The last sentence is

425
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,342
spring rain

426
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,814
Your dad only has you now

427
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,582
You have to love him well

428
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,252
She was at the last moment

429
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,487
They are still talking to you

430
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,422
Think about you

431
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,492
Why are you doing this to her?

432
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,694
she loves you so much

433
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,929
gave everything for you

434
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,131
what about you

435
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,633
Do you feel she is in your heart

436
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,601
Is it important?

437
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:36,341
good

438
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,213
I can answer you now

439
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,185
in this world

440
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,388
There is such a person

441
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,325
he is

442
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,527
My father who is related to me by blood

443
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,298
but i would rather

444
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,569
he never showed up

445
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,447
I hate him

446
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,622
This is the person I hate the most

447
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,292
my father

448
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,728
Chun Yiming

449
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,265
good

450
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,569
what about you

451
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,373
Who do you hate the most?

452
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,544
What I hate the most

453
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,280
What I hate the most

454
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,723
It's me

455
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,231
Myself

456
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,530
It’s done

457
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,471
Chunyu and the others succeeded

458
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,774
Congratulations everyone

459
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,509
Game cleared

460
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:16,895
let her go

461
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:53,498
spring rain

462
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:54,866
spring rain

463
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,503
are you okay

464
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,773
what do you want to say

465
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,743
For some time ago

466
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,611
I'm sorry for what happened.

467
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,146
But I can't help it

468
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,415
The world that Teacher Chun wants to create

469
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,382
It's also my dream

470
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,217
for this

471
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,852
I invest a lot of money

472
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,120
energy and time

473
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,255
i am willing to give everything

474
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,524
I know you are resistant

475
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,725
but

476
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,727
If you truly understand him

477
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:23,862
you will identify with him

478
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:24,496
sorry

479
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,030
I can't understand

480
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,031
Nor will I agree with it

481
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,334
What do you want to do?

482
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,103
spring rain

483
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,872
Don't you understand yet?

484
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,007
we need together

485
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,109
Complete a great project

486
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:39,511
we

487
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,013
need your help

488
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,021
I won't help you

489
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,686
Chunyu where are you

490
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,890
no

491
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,391
I have to say something today

492
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,826
Can you let me say it?

493
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,028
good

494
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,231
Then you say it

495
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,201
Xiaoqin

496
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,337
actually

497
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:14,739
I

498
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,844
I

499
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,452
What do I want to say?

500
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:31,823
I forgot

501
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,125
Yang Bawan

502
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,096
Even if you are in my dream

503
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,564
Still so cowardly

504
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,812
This is you and Yang Bawan

505
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:28,813
It's a partnership, right?

506
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,491
Really

507
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,360
Can't hide anything

508
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,494
My piano goddess

509
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:44,896
However

510
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,731
Not considered a partnership

511
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,002
At best, he's an accomplice.

512
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,306
Yesterday during recess

513
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,140
Yang Bawan

514
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,242
she left

515
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,010
Let me talk to you

516
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,546
Yang Bawan called me to the corridor

517
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,281
What do I think about you two?

518
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,182
It's weird today

519
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,683
what happened

520
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:07,785
Nothing

521
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,753
Say it quickly

522
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,721
Let me help you think of a solution

523
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,689
Keep begging me

524
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,058
do you know

525
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:14,926
Xiaoqin raised a pot

526
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,094
green mandala

527
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,462
have no idea

528
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:18,963
That thing

529
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:19,897
It never sprouted

530
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:20,698
That didn't sprout

531
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,766
How did she know it was green?

532
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,134
Don't interrupt me

533
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,537
She kept saying that she would wait until it sprouts

534
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,805
Everything is fine

535
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:29,741
The result was yesterday

536
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,343
I saw her using a pot of boiling water

537
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,644
Pour it in that flower pot

538
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,848
But who knows

539
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,583
By 10:50 p.m.

540
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,684
When the lights are almost out

541
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,451
Sudden

542
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,120
I received a text message

543
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:43,788
elegant

544
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:44,689
Come

545
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:46,824
What's the matter

546
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:47,992
do me a favor

547
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,260
what

548
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,102
sure

549
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,140
Thank you

550
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,541
You are welcome

551
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,852
What's wrong

552
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,387
That's it

553
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,290
I was also helpless

554
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,660
Don't blame me

555
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,129
Forced to have no choice

556
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,730
I'm afraid this is all

557
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,665
You helped him plan it, right?

558
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:01,732
I didn’t

559
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,367
This is all what he thought about

560
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,536
You don’t even know, Xiaoqin

561
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,071
Yesterday Yang Bawan

562
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,072
Visited several

563
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,140
Flower, Bird, Insect and Fish Market

564
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,008
Dozens or hundreds of green plant shops

565
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,610
I finally found one

566
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,178
real

567
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:16,981
real

568
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,449
I lied to you

569
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,884
I am a puppy

570
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,258
This is not it at all

571
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,459
green mandala

572
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,262
Just an ordinary pot of green radish

573
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,143
She saw the flowerpot

574
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:48,813
But she said it wasn't

575
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,814
green mandala

576
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,215
But pothos

577
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,450
It's over, it's over

578
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,217
It's my fault

579
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,585
This is too careless.

580
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,788
what should i do

581
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,825
I don't know either

582
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,693
Please help me think of a solution

583
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,061
Are there any remedies?

584
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:05,696
have

585
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:06,864
Say it quickly Say it quickly

586
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,267
Sit back and wait, it's over

587
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,140
It's over, it's over, it's over

588
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,974
It's really over this time

589
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,243
Yang Bawan

590
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,215
Xiaoqin

591
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,351
me me me

592
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,686
There are classes in the morning

593
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,587
I'm late. I'm late.

594
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,588
I'll leave first

595
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:38,930
sorry

596
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,164
Sorry, Xiaoqin

597
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,232
I really didn’t know this was pothos

598
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,099
Not a green mandala

599
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,334
you give it to me

600
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,802
Can I give you another one?

601
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,871
It doesn't matter what it is

602
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,209
What's important

603
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,744
seeds of hope

604
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,246
It has sprouted in my heart

605
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,127
you mean

606
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,171
very nice

607
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:22,506
Xiaoqin

608
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,542
You, why don't you sit down first?

609
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,443
I'll buy you whatever you want to eat

610
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,143
OK

611
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:26,911
Come

612
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,287
Why isn't Uncle Lin here?

613
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,723
I also asked this morning

614
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:39,724
The aunt at the window next door said

615
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,524
He took leave today

616
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,259
I won’t come over today

617
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,627
But

618
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,061
Chunyu is not in the dormitory either

619
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:45,696
Chunyu and Uncle Lin

620
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,497
Is it in the game?

621
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:47,632
What stimulated you?

622
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,671
Yes

623
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:54,972
do you feel

624
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:55,740
This time the game

625
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,174
A little different from before

626
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,710
But what's the difference?

627
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,146
have no idea

628
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,881
But I always feel

629
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:04,782
it's digging

630
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,350
Our innermost secrets

631
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,567
Let's have a good chat

632
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,703
for children
