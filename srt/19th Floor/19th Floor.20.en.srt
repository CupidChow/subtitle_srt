1
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,092
Game starts

2
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,296
That

3
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,699
Which of us will go first?

4
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,872
Then I'll help you out.

5
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,415
Player confirmation

6
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,084
Nian Sulan

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,819
Questions start

8
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,754
Have you always felt

9
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,490
I am much better than others

10
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,125
Not bad

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,594
but to be honest

12
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,696
My family conditions are okay

13
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,431
Academic performance is also okay

14
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,000
Or student union president

15
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,301
so

16
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,702
More or less

17
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,970
There will still be a sense of superiority

18
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,038
I admit it

19
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,476
Judgment

20
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,813
Honesty

21
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,154
second question

22
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,455
There's still a problem

23
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,059
I found this

24
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,861
There is someone you hate the most

25
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,996
Please say her name

26
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:30,643
present

27
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,512
Not my dear juniors and juniors

28
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,280
That's my respected senior

29
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,648
There is one more

30
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,016
affable uncle

31
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,018
Of course there is no one I hate

32
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,854
Really? Really?

33
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,089
Of course

34
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,658
final warning

35
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,727
Liars will suffer

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,262
severe punishment

37
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,830
Senior sister

38
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,332
this game

39
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,833
You must tell the truth

40
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,401
Nian Sulan

41
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,070
This game is better than you think

42
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,770
be more dangerous

43
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,038
Think clearly before answering

44
00:03:59,372 --> 00:03:59,806
right

45
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,140
Don't lie

46
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,942
People who died in the game

47
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,477
Will be comatose in reality

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,012
who lied

49
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,013
If you don't want me to play, just say so.

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,780
No need to say this

51
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,781
scary nonsense

52
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,051
Judgment

53
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,124
lie

54
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,001
Why should you judge?

55
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,168
Where did I lie?

56
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,103
What kind of broken game is this?

57
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:30,970
Not fun at all

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,671
this kind of game

59
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,405
I want to put it in my dad’s company

60
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,406
Can't even pass the project meeting

61
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,394
Senior sister

62
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,237
Yan Mingliang, you are going too far

63
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,806
Who is Yan Mingliang?

64
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,474
Stop pretending

65
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,411
Don't care who I am

66
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,046
Just focus on the game

67
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:13,813
Enough

68
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,448
continue

69
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:20,953
spring rain

70
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:21,654
spring rain

71
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,221
spring rain

72
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,856
Let’s discuss it first, Chunyu

73
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,593
Player confirmation

74
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,461
spring rain

75
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,262
Lin Yongfu

76
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:29,562
Lao Gao

77
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,730
How come you confirmed it?

78
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,099
Other players please step back

79
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:37,203
spring rain

80
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:37,804
Uncle Lin

81
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,772
Be careful

82
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,610
First question

83
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,513
Have you ever lost

84
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,881
favorite person

85
00:05:59,459 --> 00:05:59,926
right

86
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,495
right

87
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,731
Judgment

88
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,100
Honesty

89
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,969
second question

90
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,840
Does his death have anything to do with you?

91
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,675
mother

92
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,111
mother

93
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,081
mother

94
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,618
mother

95
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,520
please answer

96
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:32,725
right

97
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:34,794
right

98
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:36,763
Judgment

99
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,498
Honesty

100
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,669
The third question

101
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,972
Who do you hate the most?

102
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,911
Yes, everything about you is important

103
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,079
Children are not important

104
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:53,846
for you

105
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,781
I'm even less important

106
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,515
Really?

107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,720
Who do you hate?

108
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,954
Such a simple thing

109
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,256
Can't you even say it?

110
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,091
Please answer truthfully

111
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,364
spring spring rain

112
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,198
Uncle Lin

113
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,332
You have to say it quickly

114
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:14,901
Yes, Chunyu

115
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,768
what are you hesitating about

116
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,036
Please answer quickly

117
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,207
last three seconds

118
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:22,975
three

119
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,479
two

120
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:27,480
spring rain

121
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:28,915
one

122
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:29,849
time is up

123
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:31,317
spring rain

124
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:31,951
Uncle Lin

125
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,219
spring rain

126
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:33,753
spring rain

127
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:34,620
Uncle Lin

128
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,192
What the hell did you do to them?

129
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,893
refuse to answer

130
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,562
must be punished

131
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:55,975
Forget it, Chunyu

132
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,845
Don’t worry about this issue anymore

133
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,081
Are you okay, Uncle Lin?

134
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,483
It's okay It's okay

135
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:04,717
My legs

136
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,852
Already have rheumatism

137
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,087
Now the pain is getting worse

138
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,689
Even if it's fighting fire with fire

139
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,257
Come, let me help you

140
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,130
How is it

141
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,166
It's OK It's OK

142
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:22,902
Let's go

143
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,604
I'll hold you up

144
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,552
what is that

145
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,753
Still shining

146
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,524
There may be fluorescent powder in it

147
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,336
left

148
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,513
Two players open the maze tunnel

149
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,215
They're fine

150
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,150
Escape from the tunnel

151
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,818
You can pass the level

152
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,522
Remaining players please continue the game

153
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,977
Will I go wrong?

154
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,412
I feel the passage here

155
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,413
Almost the same

156
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,114
The wind is blowing this way

157
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,649
The exit is most likely over here

158
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:44,917
OK

159
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,960
There was such a big battle just now

160
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,261
Get us both down

161
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:55,895
I thought

162
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,796
Is there any scary mechanism?

163
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,763
Waiting for us

164
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,131
The result is nothing

165
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,535
What's wrong, Chunyu?

166
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,338
Uncle Lin

167
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,607
You were right to worry just now

168
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,976
This should be a punishment mechanism

169
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,111
We just didn't answer the question

170
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,379
It means not complying

171
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,246
game rules

172
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,581
But the game goes on

173
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,817
It's definitely not that simple

174
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,450
What's wrong with you

175
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,118
Are you okay?

176
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,460
Go Go quickly

177
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,973
Player confirmation

178
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,207
Gao Xuan

179
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,843
Questions start

180
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,112
Enter the game from

181
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,681
Start from the first day

182
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,016
You are hiding a secret

183
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,153
You know a lot of inside stories on the 19th floor

184
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,088
But you hid it from them

185
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,923
Yes or no

186
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,372
yes

187
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,378
Judgment

188
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,080
Honesty

189
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,250
Next, please answer Xu Wenya

190
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,852
Why did you ask a question?

191
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,686
Just change someone.

192
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,698
Why are you hiding it?

193
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,632
Such an important thing

194
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,174
first question

195
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,277
Are you a selfish person?

196
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:33,819
yes

197
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,155
Judgment

198
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,923
Honesty

199
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,725
second question

200
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,595
If you want to pass this game

201
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,830
Let you choose everyone to die

202
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,532
Or you die

203
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,834
You must choose everyone to die

204
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,803
right?

205
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,212
No

206
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,714
final warning

207
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,682
Liars will suffer

208
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,451
severe punishment

209
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,929
How is it possible?

210
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,398
We've been through it together for so long

211
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,399
we already are

212
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,001
A very close gaming partner

213
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:22,701
and

214
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,570
whether in game

215
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,671
Still in life

216
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,972
Everyone has been helping

217
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,240
last three seconds

218
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,444
three

219
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,114
I I don't know

220
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:36,916
two

221
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:40,820
one

222
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,254
Yes Yes Yes

223
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:42,955
what is

224
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:43,923
You make it clear

225
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:50,729
if

226
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,800
in game

227
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,603
I want to choose

228
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,539
I die or everyone dies

229
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,110
I choose

230
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,750
Everyone die

231
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,390
Judgment

232
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,092
Honesty

233
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,471
Now please answer Doudou

234
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,861
first question

235
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,197
Do you think Yang Bawan

236
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,798
is a coward

237
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,368
yes or no

238
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:14,980
yes

239
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,516
Judgment

240
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,685
Honesty

241
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,687
second question

242
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:22,755
Doudou

243
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,691
There is no way you can accept Yang Bawan

244
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,160
yes or no

245
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,209
answer quickly

246
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:53,519
no

247
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,720
Let me ask the third question

248
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,654
I answer

249
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,289
last three seconds

250
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,728
three

251
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:07,800
two

252
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,070
Wait a moment

253
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,174
This question is a trap

254
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,375
Xiaoqin, don't pay attention to him

255
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,911
If you have any questions, come to me.

256
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,379
When you ask me later

257
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:20,713
I am a word

258
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,714
I won't even answer you

259
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,716
I warn you

260
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,485
Refusal to answer will be punished

261
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,055
If you are punished, you will be punished.

262
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,023
your questions

263
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,358
It’s nonsense in itself

264
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,259
So what if I'm a coward?

265
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,527
Everyone knows this

266
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,363
But I am willing to be brave for my companions

267
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,130
second

268
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,298
Can she accept me?

269
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:39,932
Does it matter?

270
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,834
What's important is that I really like her

271
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,035
and that's enough

272
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,339
in your life

273
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,607
Is it because no one likes you?

274
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,608
Do you understand?

275
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,776
what do you like

276
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,478
You don’t need to ask the third question.

277
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,712
Do you want to ask in the game

278
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,314
Will she choose her death or me?

279
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,849
You just dare to hide behind the screen

280
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,751
Asking these low-level and boring questions

281
00:16:58,951 --> 00:16:59,685
In addition to sowing discord, you

282
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,619
and deliberately looking for trouble

283
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,920
What else can you do?

284
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,932
Quick, quick, quick

285
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,287
spring rain hand

286
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,288
spring rain hand

287
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,556
give me your hand

288
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,558
Hurry up

289
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,103
Good risk

290
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,272
Let's go

291
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:53,872
Walk

292
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,607
let's go let's go

293
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,281
It's all blood

294
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:04,683
It's OK

295
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,284
let's go

296
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:05,818
Don't move

297
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,328
Bear with it

298
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:24,770
Come

299
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,405
I help you

300
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:26,872
Come

301
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,207
Slow down

302
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:39,685
walk well

303
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:40,819
Don't look at the legs yet

304
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,094
Sometimes

305
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,964
We need to face up to those wounds

306
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,232
bandage it

307
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,434
will feel much better

308
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,572
Do you

309
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,975
Everyone has lost the person they love most

310
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,513
Thank you, Uncle Lin

311
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,847
What are you thankful for?

312
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,482
It's always you who is helping me

313
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,451
And that little tall one

314
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,620
This guy is good

315
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,721
Smart

316
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,556
integrity kindness

317
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,558
How much older is he than you?

318
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,592
Senior again

319
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,561
He has to take care of everyone

320
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,396
seems to have ignored you

321
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,798
But I can see clearly

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,601
The person he cares about most is you

323
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,071
In fact, two people get along

324
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:34,806
There will inevitably be friction

325
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,742
Those misunderstandings

326
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,410
It's just a matter of one or two sentences

327
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,912
It'll be fine if it makes sense

328
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,180
spring rain

329
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,950
I can't stop bleeding

330
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,285
Why don't you take a rest first?

331
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,053
It's okay, it's okay, Uncle Lin

332
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,923
Find the exit before I pass out

333
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:51,924
Otherwise it will be troublesome

334
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,159
OK

335
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:54,793
Walk

336
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,999
You must not sleep

337
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:02,834
if you fall asleep

338
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,502
But that's troublesome

339
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,637
Let me tell you about myself

340
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,839
Just listen and play

341
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:11,710
Come

342
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,681
We are a family of three

343
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,749
I also have a daughter

344
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,252
About the same age as you

345
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,087
when she was little

346
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,322
Just stick to me every day

347
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,157
that time

348
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,926
Although there is no money

349
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,062
I'm really happy

350
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,598
This is what is called happiness, right?

351
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,135
sorry

352
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,770
I believe in Lao Gao's decision

353
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,005
He must have his reasons

354
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,807
At the same time, I also believe in elegance

355
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,675
we all are the same

356
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:44,843
everyone has

357
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,877
A life of your own

358
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:46,812
and

359
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:48,814
We are all for others

360
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:49,881
live hard

361
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,221
Do you understand?

362
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,056
Xiaoqin

363
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,258
Believe me

364
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,692
Don't answer his question

365
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,198
from now on

366
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,566
no one will answer

367
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,367
of your problem

368
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:13,972
Eighty thousand is right

369
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,374
from now on

370
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,775
I won't answer any of your questions

371
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,278
Me too

372
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,245
good

373
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,015
Since you insist on having your own way

374
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,583
Then don't blame me

375
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,658
This light on the door

376
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,526
It's like a lie detector, right?

377
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,596
Of course

378
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,600
I can't tell with this light at all.

379
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,701
are we lying

380
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:43,802
right?

381
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,405
You figure it out

382
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,939
The rules are mine

383
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,007
Ask you questions

384
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,676
Instead of you asking me

385
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:51,443
OK

386
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,644
Then I'll follow you

387
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,712
reiterate the rules

388
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,714
The rule is one question and one answer

389
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,249
if lie

390
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,717
severe punishment

391
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,219
But you didn't say who asked the question

392
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,521
who will answer the question

393
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,323
You asked us a few questions

394
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:05,524
We can also

395
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,391
Ask you some questions

396
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,797
Please answer truthfully

397
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,366
This light can't tell the difference at all.

398
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,634
are we lying

399
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:16,902
yes

400
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,370
Or not

401
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,405
no

402
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:22,474
you lied

403
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,443
Why do you say that?

404
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,845
Questions you ask each of us

405
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,046
It's all in our hearts

406
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,014
The most confusing point

407
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,183
But the choice is only yes or no

408
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,618
Human emotions are very complex

409
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,320
Not black and white

410
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:36,822
you keep

411
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,756
put pressure on us

412
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,124
in that case

413
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,525
we can't

414
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,560
tell the true answer

415
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,861
but you have no choice

416
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:43,962
prove it

417
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,330
of course i can

418
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,965
For example, Xu Wenya just said

419
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,434
You ask her if in the game

420
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,070
Will she choose to die by herself?

421
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,572
Or choose everyone to die

422
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,741
Her choice is to let everyone die

423
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,642
But she won't do that at all

424
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,713
She admitted it herself

425
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,182
are you sure

426
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,418
Doudou

427
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,054
There is no way you can accept Yang Bawan

428
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,990
yes or no

429
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,959
Otherwise, I'll answer it

430
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:14,960
The third question

431
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,164
In that situation

432
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,166
Wenya wants to replace Xiaoqin

433
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,000
to answer questions

434
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:23,802
She knew it

435
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,836
Will be life-threatening

436
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,972
But she still chose to come forward

437
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,206
what does that mean

438
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,142
It means she doesn't want everyone to die

439
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,176
She just used it

440
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,444
Practical actions prove

441
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,246
That light's judgment on her

442
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,213
is wrong

443
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:40,719
you lied

444
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,454
so be punished

445
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,090
But the punishment is simple

446
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,659
Immediately send Chunyu and the others

447
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,593
OK OK

448
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,095
Congratulations to everyone for successfully passing the test

449
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,730
Please wait behind the door

450
00:23:58,837 --> 00:23:59,404
He still doesn't want to

451
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,238
Let them go in the spring rain

452
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,873
Directly gave another result

453
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,208
hope

454
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,777
Will Chunyu and Uncle Lin be okay?

455
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,012
It'll be fine

456
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,180
Let's go in first

457
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,314
Walk

458
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,422
spring rain

459
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,724
The exit is right in front

460
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:21,960
Hold on, Chunyu

461
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,765
hold on

462
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,272
hold on

463
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,474
hold on

464
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,210
hold on

465
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,116
spring rain

466
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,251
spring rain

467
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:47,452
sit

468
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:50,522
spring rain

469
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:51,723
spring rain

470
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,091
Chunyu, you must not sleep.

471
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,292
Wake up, wake up

472
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,094
You promised to take me out

473
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,062
you can't leave me

474
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,762
This uncle doesn't care.

475
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,530
spring rain

476
00:24:58,897 --> 00:24:59,931
Wake up, Chunyu

477
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:49,874
You are all here

478
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,676
I don't know what's going on either

479
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,478
This door opened by itself

480
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:54,245
Uncle Lin

481
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:54,913
Where is the spring rain?

482
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:00,652
spring rain

483
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,677
Thank you for bringing Su Lan

484
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,511
Send to the hospital

485
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:29,714
Mr. Nian, you're welcome.

486
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,817
I just happened to pass by

487
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,155
Annual total

488
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:39,891
I want all the truth

489
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:41,893
you have the right to know

490
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:46,998
Your daughter is in a coma

491
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:48,833
not an accident

492
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,903
But because of a game

493
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,473
what do you want to say

494
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:58,877
you should know

495
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,512
Nineteenth floor

496
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,524
Then I'll say it straight

497
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,260
I know the company has a

498
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,394
Very special components

499
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,597
A pulse device can be made

500
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,801
Used to remove implanted players

501
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,235
The secret chip in the brain

502
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:25,637
Annual total

503
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,472
Yan Mingliang will not give up

504
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,240
I hope you can give me some

505
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,242
I can assure you

506
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,278
I will definitely save your daughter

507
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:42,754
Xiao Gao

508
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,323
I have no idea

509
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,491
What game are you talking about?

510
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,559
What equipment

511
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,528
I think about it now

512
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,796
Be quietly with my daughter

513
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,371
You may also wish

514
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:02,240
Your daughter can

515
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,241
Wake up as soon as possible

516
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,277
only you now

517
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,445
Can help everyone

518
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,613
I hope you'll think about it again

519
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,982
I won't bother you anymore

520
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,166
Another one falls

521
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,436
When will this end?

522
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,472
Blame me

523
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,044
I should have reminded Senior Sister Nian

524
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:42,981
If she knew

525
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,482
If the game is so dangerous

526
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,085
She won't lie

527
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,854
Nothing will happen to her

528
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,324
It all happened so suddenly

529
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,160
We're simply too late

530
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,960
to stop her

531
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,495
Say it again

532
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,963
It’s not mentioned in the rules of the game.

533
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,398
What are the consequences of lying?

534
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:01,933
It's not your fault

535
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,501
Yes, elegant

536
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,270
It's all because that game is so shameless

537
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,772
You, don't blame yourself too much

538
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,341
no

539
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,510
I shouldn't have told her

540
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,878
The helmet thing

541
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,846
That way she won't

542
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,847
Entered the game

543
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,416
It was me who hurt her

544
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,364
Okay, Xu Wenya

545
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:34,966
You figure it out

546
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,801
Nian Sulan is not doing it for you

547
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,902
Just entered the game

548
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,804
It's her own choice

549
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,173
Everyone is an adult

550
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,208
made a decision

551
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,142
She wants herself

552
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,443
responsible for this result

553
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,213
But

554
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,614
Don't say anything else

555
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,249
You should stop crying

556
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,685
Tears can't solve any problem

557
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,721
The most important thing now

558
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,523
Yes, we have to continue

559
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,158
We just have to pass the customs

560
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,559
Only then can we save Nian Sulan

561
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,861
Save Brother Qiang, save Qingyou

562
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,062
save them all

563
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:05,830
Do you understand?

564
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,699
Cheer up

565
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,381
Do you have classes later?

566
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:25,183
have

567
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,684
Elective courses

568
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,153
Classic movie appreciation

569
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,323
Then go to class first

570
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,893
We'll talk about the rest later

571
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,280
I am leaving

572
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:06,691
Let's go

573
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,259
We're going to be late too

574
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,261
Eighty thousand

575
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,329
Just wait a moment

576
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,038
You were downstairs in the dormitory just now

577
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,239
Are you waiting for me?

578
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:23,474
I

579
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:24,776
Yes

580
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,244
Waiting for you to go to class together

581
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,048
I know what you want to say to me

582
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:32,283
I know too

583
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,284
what are you thinking

584
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,687
But 80,000

585
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:36,955
our friends

586
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,222
are still in danger

587
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,891
We still have so many hurdles to overcome

588
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,794
I'm really not in the mood right now

589
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,162
to talk about those things

590
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:50,568
Scared me to death

591
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,336
I thought you wanted to follow me

592
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,136
I can't say it

593
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,973
Okay, okay, I'm totally fine

594
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,775
Then the recent period

595
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,578
Let's make more space

596
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:01,312
and time

597
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,780
Leave it to more important things

598
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:05,817
OK

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,640

609
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,245

00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:43,454
Don't move

618
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,923
You must not sleep, Chunyu

619
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,358
if you fall asleep

620
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,126
But that's troublesome

621
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,599
Come

00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:54,999

opened the door

631
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,011
Otherwise we won't be able to get out

632
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,713
The door was never closed

633
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,214
Later I tried my best

634
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,049
Just pushed it away

635
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,951
What does that classmate want?

636
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,254

Already have rheumatism

640
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,643
Now the pain is getting worse

641
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,311
Even if it's fighting fire with fire

642
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,223

643
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,524

652
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,034

00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:38,336
Got it wrong

654
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,339
Do you want to steal some?

655
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,340
What to eat?

656
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:53,678
Annual total

657
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:54,979

658
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,880

Yongcheng

00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,521
Why are you free to come to me today?

662
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,957

663
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:09,493
Yongcheng

664
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,561
Don't worry first

665
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,396
Let's have a good chat

666
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,931
What's there to talk about?

667
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:14,999
you must today

668
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,167
release my daughter

669
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:17,501
Otherwise

670
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,703
What else?

671
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,601

673
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,370
Such a good computer

674
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,681
You want to destroy the nineteenth floor?

675
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,884
I made your daughter

676
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,085
Did you get to the 19th floor?

677
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,487
you do not know

678
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,088
The rules of the 19th floor?

679
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,096
Yongcheng

680
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,372
Rules are the foundation of the game

681
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,341
I can't do it for one person

682
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,742
break the rules

683
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,177
But my daughter

684
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,112
Your daughter is only temporarily comatose.

685
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,515
I'll make her wake up

686
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:39,850

687
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,256
