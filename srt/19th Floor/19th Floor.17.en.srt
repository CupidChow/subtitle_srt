1
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,889
we are ready to start

2
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,330
come on come on

3
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,564
Qingyou Ayong

4
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,432
Brother Qiang Hei Er

5
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,367
Don't thank us too much

6
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,850
Welcome to the happy world

7
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,819
what is this doing

8
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,721
let me go

9
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,122
What's going on?

10
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:16,956
Don't worry

11
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:17,924
Don't be anxious. Don't be anxious. Don't be anxious.

12
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,662
No, Chunyu

13
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,496
This can't be opened at all

14
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,530
we were lied to

15
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,500
Where's Gao Xuan?

16
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,236
No don't know

17
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:32,839
Everyone

18
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,775
The game is not over yet

19
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,077
welcome everyone

20
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,380
Happy World Part 2

21
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,682
Happy Circus

22
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,085
so you don't care at all

23
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,553
What agreement and so-called evidence

24
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,221
right?

25
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,689
Chunyu, you forgot

26
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,957
It's a non-player character

27
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,692
I know you're monitoring it

28
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,459
How

29
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,927
You only dare to do it

30
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,162
Dare not admit it personally

31
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,770
you are right

32
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,410
In this case

33
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,245
You put in this act carefully

34
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,246
why

35
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,086
Actually that day

36
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,688
You guys break in

37
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,657
It's Gao Xuan

38
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,392
When I broke into the equipment room

39
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,660
Indeed for our system

40
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,594
caused harm

41
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,300
cause server

42
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,568
Disconnected from your chip

43
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,203
Information about some of your players

44
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,338
all lost

45
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,473
I'm worried

46
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,841
who knows

47
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,743
You take the initiative to deliver it to your door

48
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,044
What's the deal?

49
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,048
So I just went with the flow

50
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,591
It's better now

51
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,727
All data has been restored

52
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,562
you bastard

53
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,329
You lied to us

54
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,764
Simply shameless

55
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:05,998
Where's Gao Xuan?

56
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,533
What did you do to him?

57
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,168
rest assured

58
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,938
Now that he's in the game

59
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,605
Will naturally follow

60
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,273
Here are the rules of the game

61
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,409
I won't deal with him casually

62
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,910
where is he

63
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,013
Let’s sell it first

64
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,915
You'll find out later

65
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,651
I don't want to play this damn game anymore

66
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,053
You let me out

67
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,521
You let me out

68
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,456
That's not okay

69
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,558
Who am I?

70
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,760
There are two disadvantages

71
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,561
One is obsessive-compulsive disorder

72
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,896
endless things to do

73
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,830
It hurts to look at it

74
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,198
two

75
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,800
I hate others threatening me

76
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,570
but i like it very much

77
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,639
A person who follows the rules of the game

78
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,041
As long as you can pass the level

79
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,811
everyone can be saved

80
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,881
If there is no problem

81
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,118
I will announce the rules of the game

82
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,853
Your voice is so ugly

83
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,889
you can shut me up

84
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:03,990
Chainsaw at the same time

85
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,558
You can also shut up Xu Wenya

86
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,735
Or accept my voice

87
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,570
Listen carefully to how to save her

88
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,772
what to do

89
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,074
you see

90
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,142
Do you have two bicycles?

91
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,280
Don't worry

92
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,282
After the game starts

93
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,150
Chainsaws will continue to decline

94
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,052
If the speed of the bicycle

95
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,520
More than thirty kilometers per hour

96
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,756
The chainsaw will stop falling

97
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,657
Start to pick up

98
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,492
The faster the bicycle

99
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,993
The higher the chainsaw goes

100
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,496
Chainsaw rises to high point

101
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,131
Xu Wenya's safety

102
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:45,898
You pass

103
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,634
I have to remind you

104
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,404
Two people must be absolutely in sync

105
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,139
Speed ​​is effective

106
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:55,942
I

107
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,844
What is this thing in my hand?

108
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,047
That was my finishing touch

109
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,815
bomb detonator

110
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,751
You can explode at any time

111
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,886
bomb on bicycle

112
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,954
chainsaw

113
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,956
Will also stop falling at any time

114
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,094
That

115
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,331
What about the guy on the bike?

116
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,832
The bombs exploded

117
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,300
Do you think there are still people alive?

118
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,769
You pervert

119
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,438
Are you sick?

120
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,572
now

121
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,008
Please select a contestant for the game

122
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,710
the other two

123
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,645
You need to go to another party

124
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,381
Is Gao Xuan over there?

125
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:38,684
you guess

126
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,255
spring rain

127
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,156
You go find Lao Gao

128
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,391
I stayed

129
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,160
This is a physical game

130
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,795
Otherwise, Doudou, you can stay here first.

131
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,697
Please two

132
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,299
Mobile theater

133
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,639
spring rain

134
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,575
you

135
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,443
You, don't go

136
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,080
if you believe me

137
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,016
you can trust them

138
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,971
You only have to do one thing

139
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,839
Just let your fingers

140
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,608
stay away from your buttons

141
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,013
Have fun

142
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,116
Are those two riders ready?

143
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,018
game

144
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,520
Start

145
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:50,590
elegant

146
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,457
Don't worry

147
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,258
Me and Doudou

148
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,593
Particularly powerful in this regard

149
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,093
I'm with you

150
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,198
it started to move

151
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,233
Come on, come on, it's moving

152
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,219
Gao Xuan

153
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:20,886
Gao Xuan

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,154
Are you okay, Gao Xuan?

155
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:27,793
spring rain

156
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,495
Uncle Lin

157
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,302
I know you want to save him

158
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,005
But the game has its rules

159
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,773
You bastard

160
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,210
Save your lung capacity to yourself

161
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,645
After the game starts

162
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,912
The water tank will be filled with water

163
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,813
I'm curious

164
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,649
You'll keep the breath in your lungs

165
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,851
Or use it to shout for help?

166
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,620
How can you let him out?

167
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,055
no no no

168
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,490
you said it wrong

169
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,358
It wasn't me who let him out

170
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,726
But you

171
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,594
How to pass

172
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,795
rescue him

173
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,042
You must take turns pulling out the blocks

174
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,377
If ten building blocks are drawn

175
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,578
And the tower of blocks doesn’t fall down

176
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,714
Water injection will stop

177
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,249
He can live

178
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:24,617
Of course

179
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,452
The speed of extracting building blocks

180
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,654
It has to be faster than the speed of water injection.

181
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,289
we had several chances

182
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,758
As you like

183
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,660
But every time it collapses

184
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,594
There will be one more in the water tank

185
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,328
Water inlet

186
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:37,897
I think

187
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,198
you don't have much

188
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
room for failure

189
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,204
What a bastard

190
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,239
take other people's fate

191
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,441
In the palm of your hand

192
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,475
Very happy, right?

193
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,977
You also have the opportunity to do this

194
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,848
feel

195
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,283
Do you have that remote control in your hand?

196
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,321
careful

197
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,723
Otherwise, they both will die.

198
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,928
So blow us up

199
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,796
He can live

200
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:13,799
This is called

201
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,934
Everything is under control

202
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,204
I'm not like you

203
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:19,872
I will only hold

204
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,273
Things that should belong to me

205
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,046
pretty

206
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,781
You put all the pressure now

207
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,849
Throw it all to others

208
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,485
It's not that noble at all.

209
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,822
Now you can take your place

210
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,791
Game starts

211
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,370
spring rain

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,271
Uncle Lin

213
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,006
Don't worry too much about me

214
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:54,874
Gao Xuan

215
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,776
do you believe me

216
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,361
How could this happen?

217
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,600
I just forgot to say

218
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,602
To make the game more exciting

219
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,770
The number of blocks each time

220
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,539
will decrease and decrease in sequence

221
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,741
The more times you fail

222
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,875
The faster it falls

223
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,644
It's challenging enough

224
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,712
Don't let me down

225
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,413
spring rain

226
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,315
no

227
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,250
Doudou, come on!

228
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,084
Kick hard

229
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,253
I've been pedaling hard

230
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,154
It's you who's kicking around

231
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:15,654
no

232
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,822
Didn't he say that?

233
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,591
You two need to be absolutely in sync

234
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,492
Can it produce effective speed?

235
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,527
You have to be consistent

236
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,528
Yes, yes, I remembered it

237
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,062
Remembered

238
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:23,829
be consistent

239
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,998
This way, this way

240
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,433
Doudou, listen to my rhythm.

241
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,400
We both are on the same page

242
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:28,934
OK

243
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,437
Okay one two one two

244
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,771
one two one two

245
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,440
one two one two

246
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:44,817
no

247
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,852
I want to believe them

248
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,290
one two one two

249
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:51,891
Eighty thousand

250
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,893
You shout a little slower

251
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,895
Then step a little slower

252
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,763
Just make sure you're both in agreement first.

253
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,131
ok

254
00:14:59,131 --> 00:14:59,999
Yes Yes Yes Yes

255
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,167
Calm down and take it step by step

256
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,436
Doudou, let’s slow down a little bit

257
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,605
one two

258
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,040
one two

259
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,608
one two

260
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,644
one two

261
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,178
one two

262
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,680
one two

263
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,181
one two

264
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,816
one two

265
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,222
good

266
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,190
That's it, that's it, that's it

267
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,092
one two

268
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,562
Then we try again

269
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,597
slightly faster

270
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,531
OK OK Hurry up

271
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,500
Come one two one two

272
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,201
one two one two

273
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,207
one two

274
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,876
one two

275
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,844
one two one two

276
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,447
ok ok ok

277
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,182
Shouting for beats is really useful.

278
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,318
This victory is right in front of you

279
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,520
Fortunately I'm standing here

280
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,888
if i were there

281
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,323
My legs are probably broken

282
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,760
Xiaoqin

283
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:02,962
You always wear a mask

284
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,330
Doesn't the shadow affect your breathing?

285
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,164
In fact, you are now

286
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,565
No need to wear it at all

287
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,567
I am Doudou

288
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:10,536
Doudou

289
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,136
yes

290
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,438
I think both of us

291
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,339
There's quite a tacit understanding.

292
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:13,973
From now on we both

293
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,740
Just form a partner

294
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,774
We both called

295
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,076
Badou partner

296
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,113
Come

297
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:21,814
Come on

298
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,015
Victory is in sight

299
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,351
Smoke this one

300
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,364
There are only the last two left.

301
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,166
Will definitely succeed

302
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,601
Don't be nervous

303
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:26,879
Mr. Yan

304
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,313
They're going to pass

305
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,487
The real game is just about to begin

306
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,939
Stop pretending to be calm

307
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,443
In fact, you know it in your heart

308
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,279
You can't save it at all

309
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,213
The person you want to save

310
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,521
It was like this back then

311
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,204
Gao Xuan

312
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,207
This is also the case now

313
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,676
everything is in vain

314
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,711
If I could pull out ten blocks

315
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,213
And the tower does not fall

316
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,881
Mom will be fine

317
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,532
one

318
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,169
two

319
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,405
three

320
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,175
Four

321
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,513
five

322
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,450
six

323
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,621
seven

324
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,197
eight

325
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,000
Nine

326
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,679
ten

327
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,364
Doctor

328
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,834
my lover

329
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,103
sorry

330
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,672
we have tried our best

331
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,696
Round 1 of the Block Tower Game

332
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,732
Fail

333
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,282
one two

334
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,316
one two

335
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,317
one two

336
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,752
Victory is just around the corner

337
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:27,653
come on

338
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,887
one two

339
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,055
one two

340
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,856
one two

341
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:31,857
one two

342
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,631
Okay everyone

343
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,700
The game starts now

344
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,403
This is the women's foil final

345
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,672
The contestant on the right is Zhao Meijuan

346
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,873
Very strong

347
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,207
Won the national championship

348
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,542
The player on the left

349
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,376
It's Nan Xiaoqin

350
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,111
He also comes from a fencing family.

351
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:54,880
Nan Xiaoqin’s mother

352
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,415
He's a famous foil fencer

353
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,716
Won many championships

354
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,717
Her mother is now

355
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,718
Also her coach

356
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,419
so

357
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,020
Nan Xiaoqin’s true story

358
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:06,692
good

359
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:07,659
Just now Nan Xiaoqin

360
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,493
a quick dash

361
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,127
pretty

362
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,095
Effective score

363
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:10,929
one to zero

364
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,097
Players are excited

365
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,368
Nan Xiaoqin rubbed her legs

366
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,502
It should be fine

367
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:18,937
OK OK

368
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,971
Both sides continue

369
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,841
Nan Xiaoqin started attacking again

370
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:23,975
It can be seen

371
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,243
She plays very aggressively

372
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,078
This point

373
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,579
Just like her mother

374
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:36,888
What's going on

375
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,156
she fell suddenly

376
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,059
she stopped

377
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,594
It seems painful

378
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,139
Oh my god

379
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,007
She signaled to end the game

380
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,354
What are you doing? Pay attention.

381
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,955
Sorry Sorry Sorry

382
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,491
Doudou, listen to the beat

383
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,793
You follow the beat

384
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,960
Doudou

385
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:49,995
What's wrong with you

386
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,534
My legs are gone

387
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,502
what are you talking about

388
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,470
What happened to her

389
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,039
I can't ride anymore

390
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,040
Doudou

391
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,208
look at me

392
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:04,376
Doudou

393
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,277
My legs are gone

394
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:16,621
good

395
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,089
Let's try going uphill

396
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:41,880
How is it

397
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,215
It's OK

398
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,253
except fencing

399
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:49,888
What else are you interested in?

400
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:52,757
I

401
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,526
Are you saying she can't practice anymore?

402
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,695
I just suggest

403
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,563
Keep her away from high-intensity exercise

404
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,532
Life is still okay

405
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,339
I see

406
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:11,676
Mom

407
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,677
I can

408
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,312
Mom

409
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,274
My legs are gone

410
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:43,375
what

411
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,513
It's a bit cruel to say this

412
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,814
but it's true

413
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:50,916
Your leg

414
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:51,917
May not be restored

415
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,951
Same as before

416
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,253
I can't ride anymore

417
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,855
My legs are gone

418
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,758
What's wrong with your legs?

419
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,128
it hurts

420
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,430
My legs are about to break

421
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,499
what are you talking nonsense

422
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,934
This is in the game

423
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,035
in game

424
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,736
No, Doudou, what’s wrong with you?

425
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:12,604
Doudou

426
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,448
sorry

427
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,016
sorry

428
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:25,850
I don't want to die

429
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:27,852
I don't want to die

430
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,120
Xu Wenya No

431
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,558
second round

432
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,161
Block tower game failed

433
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,168
spring rain

434
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,436
Blame me

435
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,670
when i smoke

436
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:46,771
The tower is shaking

437
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,573
causing you to be unable to continue

438
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,407
Uncle Lin

439
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,343
Sorry

440
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,510
Blame me

441
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,245
It has nothing to do with you

442
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,014
spring rain

443
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:56,848
Uncle Lin

444
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,250
It's okay

445
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,251
we have time

446
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,221
Round 3 Block Tower Game

Start

448

spring rain

449
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,361
are you okay

450
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,132
I'm fine

451
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,420
Round 3 Block Tower Game

452
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,855
Fail

453
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,074
Stop pretending to be calm

454
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,211
In fact, you know very well

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,312
You can't save it at all

456
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,513
The person you want to save

457
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,615
It was like this back then

458
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,916
This is also the case now

459
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,284
spring rain

460
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,552
I'm a little scared

461
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,653
I just think

462
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,689
I feel safe with you

463
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,957
this time

464
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,925
Finally I'm protecting you

465
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,560
As long as you still want

466
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,461
continue this game

467
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:24,896
I won't leave

468
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,364
thank you

Fail

472
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,004
Fail

473
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,172
mother

474
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,441
mother

475
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,476
Nan Xiaoqin

476
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:46,918
Mom

477
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,320
My legs are not working anymore?

478
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,923
If not, come down.

479
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,591
don't waste my time

480
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,660
Mom

481
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,295
I can do it. Look.

482
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,570
you disappoint me so much

483
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,173
I spent so much effort

484
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:08,973
train you

485
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,009
Is that all you need to make a living?

486
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,278
not affecting

487
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,979
I can also fence

488
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,381
I think you should give up

489
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,816
Give up

490
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,151
your whole life

491
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,452
It’s impossible to fencing anymore

492
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,354
Nan Xiaoqin

493
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,456
you are a waste

494
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,660
Yes, Nan Xiaoqin

495
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,395
We are trash

496
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,529
I'm not

497
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,964
I'm not

498
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,299
Nan Xiaoqin Nan Xiaoqin

499
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:34,999
Nan Xiaoqin

500
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:35,934
We are trash

501
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:36,334
no

502
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,001
Nan Xiaoqin

503
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,203
you are a waste

504
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,137
Yes, Nan Xiaoqin

505
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,271
We are trash

506
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:40,972
no

507
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,042
Doudou, I’m not

508
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:45,810
I'm not

509
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,412
Doudou, wake up

510
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,813
Your legs are fine

511
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,248
Doudou

512
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,219
Doudou

513
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,553
Doudou, wake up

514
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,921
Doudou, your legs are fine

515
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,658
Too late

516
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,960
It's really too late

517
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:02,994
Don't move

518
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,530
Nan Xiaoqin

519
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,598
you listen to me

520
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,233
It doesn’t matter whether you are Doudou or not

521
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,000
Nan Xiaoqin is also good

522
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,934
None of this matters

523
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,169
Come out from behind the mask

524
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,670
think about the real you

525
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,773
The Xiaoqin I know

526
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,641
at this time

527
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,642
Will never back down

528
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,877
I will never bow my head

529
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,012
And you are not alone

530
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,413
you and me

531
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,882
And elegance

532
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,083
we are all friends

533
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:25,850
is a team

534
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:26,951
No one can leave anyone behind

535
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:27,752
Do you know

536
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,523
Because she is braver than us

537
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,059
She is the most beautiful I have ever seen in my life

538
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:35,960
The most sassy

539
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,362
The kindest girl

540
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,631
good

541
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,239
Same for you

542
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,274
You have to believe us

543
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,174
we are friends

544
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,312
No one can leave anyone behind

545
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:24,976
spring rain

546
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:26,978
spring rain

547
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,380
spring rain

548

spring rain

549

spring rain

550
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,452
Chunyu, listen to me

551
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,021
I trust you

552
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,890
You can do it

553
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,229
spring rain

554
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:46,631
What's wrong with you

555
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,734
I promise you

556
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:50,768
spring rain

557
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,470
I will definitely come back

558
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,340
Especially with you

559
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,674
Those bits and pieces

560
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,043
Even if it's a minute or a second

561
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,112
I don't even want to forget

562
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,019
spring rain

563
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,921
let's do it again

564
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,647
game over

565
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,581
My legs are really bad

566
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,484
Get up quickly

567
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,430
It's okay

568
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,598
It's over

569
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,877
Gao Xuan and the others are still inside.

570
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,461
And the last one

571
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,962
Didn't fall Didn't fall

572
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:12,964
Congratulations everyone

573
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,632
Game cleared

Gao Xuan

576
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,112
Gao Xuan

577
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,883
we have won

578
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:33,884
water in water tank

579
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,019
Why don't you retreat?

580
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,221
Are the two related?

581
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:40,725
Gao Xuan

582
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,230
Lao Gao
