1
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
spring rain

2
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
Senior sister said Gao Xuan

3
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,920
It's us in the ghost house

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The one I met?

5
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,960
have no idea

6
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,880
But if he really is

7
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
Substitute teacher in our school

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,440
Why are you in a ghost house?

9
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,480
Don't tell us

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
I think he is

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
Particularly suspicious

12
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,760
spring rain

13
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm a little uncomfortable

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
Let's go first

15
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
If you feel uncomfortable, go back first

16
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
I have something else to do

17
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,280
The modeling size is wrong

18
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,120
Internal architecture

19
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,640
It's not based on this model.

20
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
always follow me

21
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,960
Do you have something to say?

22
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,840
that

23
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Senior

24
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,160
this is what you want

25
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
Building 19 drawings

26
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,240
Thank you

27
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
If nothing happens

28
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,480
I go first

29
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,680
Senior

30
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,560
What else is going on

31
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm hosting the welcome party tonight

32
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm a little nervous

33
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,440
Still needed at the party

34
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
There is audience interaction

35
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,840
if possible

36
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,680
Can you help me with the lyrics?

37
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
what are you looking for

38
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
No, nothing

39
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,200
The welcome party is very lively

40
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,360
There will be many students by then

41
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Help you with words

42
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,280
Then remember to come tonight

43
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,000
good

44
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,240
Then I'll be waiting for you

45
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,440
OK

46
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,080
See you in the evening

47
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,280
OK thank you

48
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
you are discharged from hospital

49
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,720
How is it

50
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,760
Are you feeling well?

51
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,400
much better

52
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
What is this

53
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,400
Express delivery

54
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,960
You don’t know what you bought yourself

55
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,440
You want to go out

56
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,520
tonight

57
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
Isn't there a welcome party?

58
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,440
Won't you go?

59
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,960
How

60
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm lame

61
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,360
I can't join in the fun anymore

62
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
I'm sorry, Xiaoqin

63
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,680
I didn't mean that

64
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,800
sorry

65
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,040
It's OK

66
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,360
It’s normal for you to think so

67
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm injured

68
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
only temporarily

69
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,040
So I

70
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,240
The psychological shadow area is zero

71
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Just relax

72
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
If you didn't tell me, I would have forgotten

73
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,520
There's also a welcome party

74
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,480
demon king

75
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,800
Classmate Chunyu, what a coincidence

76
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
You, you come to eat

77
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
Otherwise, you should be in front of me.

78
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,520
No need, no need, no need

79
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,800
No, it's okay. You're welcome.

80
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
I went to the school next door to you in high school.

81
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,080
We are neighbors

82
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,040
Come, come, come

83
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,600
right

84
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,520
Right

85
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,840
My name is Yang Bawan

86
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,160
And your little one?

87
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,520
The one you beat him with since childhood

88
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Liuwa

89
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,280
That was also my childhood

90
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,040
No matter how big the devil is

91
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,040
I can't resist the temptation of beauty either

92
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,520
what did you say

93
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,560
Me I'm talking about that dish

94
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
Looks quite tempting

95
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,360
Right, right

96
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,120
You

97
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,760
This is the latest

98
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,320
virtual reality

99
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,680
Awesome

100
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,440
Can play games

101
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,680
I tell you

102
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
This thing costs nothing

103
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,720
They are promoting

104
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,400
As long as you can pass

105
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,800
What kind of test do they have?

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,920
Students attending the opening ceremony

107
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,440
please note

108
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,160
Please gather and get on the bus immediately

109
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,400
Welcome both of you to experience it

110
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,080
Our Tianji Technology

111
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
The latest virtual reality technology

112
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,160

113
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,600
what test

114
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
Classmate, what do you want to eat?

116
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
Just this one

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Do you want rice?

118
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,240
want to want

119
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,160

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,200
Thank you

123
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,680
master

124
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,400
Me I want this too

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,440
this

126
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,200
no no no

127
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,080
Weren't you good just now?

128
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Why are your hands shaking when you get here?

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,120
This this is not

130
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,120
It’s an old habit, good and bad sometimes.

131
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,680
Come

132
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760

133
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,720
Come

134
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,280
Aren’t I hosting the welcome tonight?

135
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,040
Then remember to come tonight

136
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,560
good

137
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,720
spring rain

138
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,520
Why did you come first, Chun Yu?

139
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
I've been waiting for you in the dormitory

140
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,640
Come on, let's take a seat first

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,360
Senior

142
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,160
you are here

143
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Right

144
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
How are you preparing for the string of words?

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,040
All very good

146
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,720
That's good

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,720
Is he

149
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,360
Then sit down quickly

150
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,080
OK

151
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,560
There are a lot of classmates

152
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,480
Don't be nervous

153
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,160
good

154
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
Okay, I'll go first then

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
He is really from our school

157
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,760
Teacher?

158
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,000
Then he has been keeping this secret

159
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,760
Why?

160
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,080
Besides, that building

161
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Building No. 19 of our school

162
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,320
exactly the same

163
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,920
He is also a teacher in our school

164
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,400
What a coincidence

165
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,480
good

166
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,440

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,760
spring rain

201
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,600
Where are you going?

202
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,640
toilet

203
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
Why have you been following me?

204
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,920
Me I didn’t follow you

205
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,960
I'll go back to the dormitory too

206
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,560
Along the way

207
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,520
Is the boys' dormitory here too?

208
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:08,880
Right

209
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,000
I watched one two days ago

210
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,040
Extremely great game

211
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,800
virtual reality

212
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,440
Well done

213
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
If you have a chance someday

214
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,320
You give it a try

215
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,200
Wearing it will make you fly

216
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,360
careful

217
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,520
Can you add WeChat?

218
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,320
It's okay

219
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,240
will be fine

220
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
I watched one two days ago

221
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
Extremely great game

222
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,800
virtual reality

223
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,440
Wearing it will make you fly

224
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,280
Mimi

225
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,280
Mimi

226
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,920
Mimi

227
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,040
Mimi

228
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,200
Mimi

229
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,160
you are here

230
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,120
Come and eat

231
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,480
mimia

232
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,080
do you have friends

233
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,560
I have a very good friend

234
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,440
but i think

235
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,760
She is getting farther and farther away from me

236
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,960
gone

237
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
Dr. Jia

238
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
why are you here

239
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,880
You left your student ID card at the hospital

240
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Originally I was thinking

241
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
I passed by the school and thought of giving it to you.

242
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,440
Didn't I scare you just now?

243
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,080
I see you and the kitten playing all the time

244
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,280
Sorry to bother you

245
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,720
No No

246
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,000
Sorry to trouble you

247
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,520
so far away

248
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,760
They even sent me a special trip

249
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,840
no trouble

250
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
I haven’t gone back to school for a long time.

251
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,520
thinking

252
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,480
Come back and miss the past

253
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,000
You also graduated from this school

254
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
It's embarrassing to say

255
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,040
I only studied for half a year

256
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,160
After dropping out, I entered medical school.

257
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,800
So powerful

258
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,680
That means

259
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,400
You can be considered half of our senior brother

260
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,360
Right

261
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
How is your health?

262
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,280
Where is that girl with you?

263
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,120
What's up

264
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,680
you two

265
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
Aren't they very good friends?

266
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,280
0419

267
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,200
You've come, why don't you go in?

268
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,680
Don’t you dare?

269
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,480
Sit anywhere

270
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
The water hasn't boiled yet

271
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Have a cool drink first

272
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,880
drink

273
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,520
Not thirsty

274
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,480
I see you are very angry

275
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,480
I added a little salt for you

276
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,160
what do you think it is

277
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,880
Do you drink salt water?

278
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,240
I didn’t really like it when I was little

279
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,120
But there is one person

280
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,080
Keep forcing me to drink

281
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
Slowly I got used to it

282
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,360
Let's get down to business

283
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,400
good

284
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,120
Tell everything you know

285
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
You lured me here on purpose

286
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,880
I know

287
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
You must also want to have a good chat

288
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,080
the last few nights

289
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,120
what happened

290
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,000
Why do you want to measure?

291
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,320
Dimensions of Building 19

292
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,280
I think you should have noticed too

293
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,960
Our two nights

294
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,080
That ghost house I went to

295
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,920
In fact, it’s Building No. 19

296
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,320
I observed carefully

297
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,160
The structure and size inside the ghost building

298
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,920
Measured with feet

299
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
The dimensions of some of the rooms

300
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,400
I think

301
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,560
If in reality this building

302
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,160
with the structure inside

303
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,280
same size

304
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
And we just because

305
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,400
some special power

306
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,680
really been there

307
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,720
Then we will definitely stay

308
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,040
some clues

309
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
If only the appearance is the same

310
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
And the inside is completely different

311
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,240
impossible for anyone

312
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,240
overnight

313
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
change internal structure

314
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,680
and restore it

315
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
If this is really the case

316
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,720
Then that ghost building we went to?

317
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,920
It doesn't really exist

318
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,480
Or rather

319
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,680
we went

320
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,640
It's not there at all

321
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,280
Measurement results

322
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,640
completely different

323
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,320
so

324
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,640
You don't know either

325
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,520
what on earth is that

326
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
how did you get in

327
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,800
Just like you

328
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
Asleep in a dream

329
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,680
Or maybe I thought it was in a dream

330
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,000
you are different from us

331
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,000
We were in a coma due to a car accident

332
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,760
Got in

333
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,200
and you don't

334
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,640
I really don't

335
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,600
But this

336
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,920
I don't know why either

337
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,800
Ah Yong

338
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,400
Your brother, I’m here to see you

339
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,160
Still sleeping

340
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,000
If you don't get up again

341
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,440
If you don't get up again

342
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
I went to pinch my feet with Hei Er.

343
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,680
I won’t take you with me anymore

344
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,200
You said Hei Er is the same?

345
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,560
own brother

346
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,320
Lying in the hospital

347
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,360
Don't even come over to take a look

348
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,560
Call him and scold him.

349
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,800
Isn’t this Hei Er’s mobile phone?

350
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,160
Hei Er, he told us last time

351
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,320
Does he want a new mobile phone?

352
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,360
Don't buy a new mobile phone?

353
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,360
Don’t want the old phone

354
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,080
Lost the hospital?

355
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,920
right

356
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,960
That must be the case

357
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,240
Ah Yong

358
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,240
I asked the doctor

359
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Doctors say you're fine

360
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,960
Then it must be okay

361
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,120
right

362
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,480
Say it again

363
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,080
We three brothers

364
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
What storms have I never seen?

365
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,760
So

366
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,680
you this time

367
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,240
You must carry it for me

368
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,920
Don't lie flat on my back

369
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,960
Did you hear that?

370
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,160
Mr. Chen

371
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,360
say

372
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,040
Right, right, right

373
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,160
You can rest assured, you can rest assured, you can rest assured

374
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,040
Vital signs normal

375
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,600
But there is no sign of waking up yet

376
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,360
emergency physician records

377
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,640
It's about alcoholism.

378
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,920
But I see him

379
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,040
blood alcohol content

380
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,960
not high

381
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Combined with other symptoms

382
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,400
teacher

383
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,560
I think

384
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,080
It's not like he's alcoholic

385
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
coma caused

386
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,000
You see

387
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,240
Do we need to do more?

388
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,160
Other checks

389
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,760
Not needed at the moment

390
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,760
Remember to go and see

391
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,960
The situation of twenty-seven beds

392
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,000
OK

393
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,520
boss

394
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,640
Game causes coma

395
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Still here with me

396
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Now in the hospital

397
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,040
There are already voices of doubt

398
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,800
Do you want to put this person

399
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,920
Also transport it out immediately

400
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,120
OK

401
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,760
I see

402
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,160
It turns out that A Yong was in a coma

403
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,720
It’s really because of the game

404
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,120
game

405
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,560
comatose

406
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,760
Here it is

407
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,520
Make you laugh

408
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,680
This is what I usually do

409
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,480
some little things

410
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,440
Is there anything else you want to ask?

411
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,800
one more thing

412
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,560
you say

413
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,880
You go to Building 19 in the afternoon

414
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,200
What did you pick up?

415
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,000
I knew you were hiding there then

416
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,720
so for

417
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,840
attract your attention

418
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,640
casually

419
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,760
Picked up a piece of cloth

420
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,200
What's wrong, Chunyu?

421
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,960
The nineteenth floor game is about to begin

422
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,560
So it's all a game
