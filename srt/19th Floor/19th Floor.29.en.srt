1
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,430
Just wait a moment

2
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,300
Yan Mingliang

3
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Why hasn't Gao Xuan woke up yet?

4
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,230
And my dad

5
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,630
What did you do to them both?

6
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,500
Uncle Yan

7
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,970
There's still time

8
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,140
let's go out together

9
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Gao Xuan

10
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,060
you

11
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,460
Just leave him in there

12
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
do not care

13
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,600
How could you ignore death?

14
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,800
These bastards are all in on the joke

15
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,640
No one went to save her

16
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,250
Yan Mingliang

17
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
He has opened the door for you

18
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,090
why don't you save him

19
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,590
Why don't you save him?

20
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,210
sorry

21
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,010
sorry

22
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,610
Let's go

23
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,740
Gao Xuan

24
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,110
Hello

25
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,740
120?

26
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,120
Officer Ye

27
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Could you please introduce us to

28
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,030
The entire investigation process of the case?

29
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
just half a month ago

30
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,960
The police received reports from the public

31
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,800
There are citizens

32
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,500
Fell into coma due to unknown reasons

33
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,130
We immediately launched an investigation

34
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,270
soon discovered

35
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,100
victim

36
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,600
Everyone plays the 19th floor game

37
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
common experience

38
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,640
Plus

39
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,070
Reports from the masses

40
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,140
Tianji Technology

41
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,540
Came into the police's sight

42
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,140
Investigate our case

43
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,210
and mastered

44
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,510
After a large amount of criminal evidence

45
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,750
We deal with criminal suspects

46
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,750
arrests made

47
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,220
At the same time, the Municipal Health Commission

48
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,080
Also to the hospital involved

49
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,320
A penalty letter was issued

50
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,350
The doctors involved were revoked

51
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,550
Physician practicing certificate

52
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,460
Because the hospital failed to discover in time

53
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,290
Doctor involved

54
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,290
abuse of power

55
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,390
Municipal Health Commission

56
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,430
to the dean of the hospital

57
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,500
impose warning sanctions

58
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,660
At the same time

59
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,800
by the Municipal Public Security Bureau

60
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
To all hospital staff

61
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,670
Conducted relevant legal education

62
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,470
this case

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,700
suspect

64
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,640
imprisoned masses

65
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,270
He was also rescued by the police

66
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,740
other relevant persons

67
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,180
Suspected of illegal and criminal acts

68
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,640
Still under further investigation

69
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,020
elder brother

70
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,650
Do you think he can still wake up?

71
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,220
I'm sure I'll wake up

72
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
It makes me uncomfortable to see

73
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,830
Uncle Chun

74
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,600
Uncle Chun

75
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,230
Hello uncle

76
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,030
Uncle Chun

77
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,140
Why don't you go in?

78
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,110
Uncle Chun

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,910
that

80
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,480
We all watched for a while

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,140
I think the current state of Chunyu

82
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,280
so many of us

83
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,750
Go in noisily

84
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,120
Not good for her

85
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,320
And Gao Xuan also needs to rest

86
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,520
so all of us

87
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,550
Just discussed it

88
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,620
Just don’t go in and disturb them.

89
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,420
OK

90
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,290
I give you your blessings

91
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,230
Brought them all

92
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,990
By the way, Uncle Chun

93
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,600
What are the test results?

94
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,660
Lao Gao

95
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,030
can you wake up

96
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,540
When the system self-destructs

97
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,440
He's trapped inside

98
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,980
Think of another way

99
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,350
As long as there is a glimmer of hope

100
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Just can't give up

101
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,220
There will definitely be a way, Uncle Chun

102
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,150
Uncle Chun

103
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,560
Then we'll leave first

104
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,360
well

105
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,190
thank you

106
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,100
spring rain

107
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,110
This is what Nan Xiaoqin gave you

108
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,210
She said this was her latest

109
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,550
bred

110
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,110
green mandala

111
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,030
The flower language of green mandala is

112
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,600
endless hope

113
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,950
Please stay with him well

114
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,620
I have something else to do

115
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,620
I go first

116
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,650
good

117
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,600
Gao Xuan

118
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,670
look

119
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,900
The sun is out

120
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,910
Gao Xuan

121
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,150
look

122
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,780
This is from Xiaoqin

123
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,850
green mandala

124
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,590
Its flower language is

125
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,260
hope

126
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,770
Gao Xuan

127
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,040
I won't give up on you

128
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,750
Eighty thousand

129
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,150
Xiaoqin

130
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,780
Quiet

131
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,420
Wenya Qiangge

132
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,460
We won't give up on you

133
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,400
come on

134
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,700
spring rain

135
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,070
spring rain

136
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,140
tell you a good news

137
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,370
Gao Xuan can be saved

138
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,170
during this time

139
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,910
Thanks to Yongcheng for helping

140
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,510
we recovered

141
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,940
Part of the 19th floor

142
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,510
Discover Gao Xuan’s consciousness

143
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,380
Still inside

144
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,910
but he is lost

145
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,680
lost in him

146
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,150
In the chaotic memory fragments

147
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,180
Only he wakes up

148
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,750
Only then can he realize his consciousness

149
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,620
Bring out the system

150
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,120
And the more

151
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,120
People he knows and cares about

152
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
the more likely it is to wake him up

153
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
nothing more than

154
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,260
It's very possible that this person's

155
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,600
Consciousness will also

156
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,830
Trapped inside and unable to get out

157
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,670
Even if only

158
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,840
One in ten thousand chance

159
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,510
I want to try too

160
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,040
Also a possibility

161
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,210
There is also an incidental result

162
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,950
Even if

163
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,020
You brought him out

164
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,250
due to consciousness factor

165
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,590
interference effect

166
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,450
he may lose

167
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,620
all the memories of you

168
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,200
you

169
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,400
you mean

170
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,340
He will forget me

171
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,220
dad

172
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,590
I must save him

173
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,960
good

174
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,340
Maybe it will be dangerous

175
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,110
careful

176
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,820
spring rain

177
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,490
spring rain

178
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,360
wake up

179
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,860
spring rain

180
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,270
spring rain

181
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,100
spring rain

182
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,510
There's a lot of fun there

183
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,240
Walk

184
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,010
look

185
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,010
what is this

186
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,080
shadow puppet

187
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,020
You hit me

188
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,790
Run quickly

189
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
What do you two mean?

190
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,560
Chasing us with props

191
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,360
non-player character

192
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,300
Are there any of you who play games like this?

193
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,860
I want everyone to play like you do

194
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,900
Does our store still need to be open?

195
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,300
You two talk

196
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,800
Walk

197
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,440
Varied

198
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,970
Chunyu Xiaolei

199
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,970
Come over

200
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,380
Watch you run

201
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,880
this hair

202
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,720
dad

203
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,550
Mom

204
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,190
spring rain

205
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,020
Take a look

206
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,950
what do you want to play

207
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,620
Let your brother Xiaolei take you there

208
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:04,590
go ahead

209
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,090
Let's go, Brother Xiaolei

210
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,560
look at them

211
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,440
Brother Xiaolei and I

212
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,870
my parents

213
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,880
Brother Xiaolei’s parents

214
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,740
How beautiful everything is

215
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,850
Even if this is a dream

216
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,850
I also hope that

217
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,620
Never wake up from this dream

218
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,230
Brother Xiaolei

219
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,860
I want to join your shadow puppet club

220
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,330
OK

221
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,130
always welcome

222
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,730
Then you can teach me

223
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,500
Wait me a moment

224
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
Go behind the curtain

225
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,250
My old grandson is here too

226
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,720
Another backflip

227
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,630
One more one

228
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,090
Awesome

229
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,600
How about feeling it

230
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,560
Come

231
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,540
I am old spring

232
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,740
Wrong

233
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,270
That’s okay. I’m also old.

234
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,740
That must be Xiaochun

235
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,110
Then my little grandson is coming, coming too

236
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,380
Come too

237
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,420
Actually it's a shadow puppet show

238
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,120
The most important thing is twisting

239
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,920
Twisting characters is the most basic

240
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
Look, it’s the same here

241
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,560
Take it a little looser

242
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,190
Then twist it left and right like this, right

243
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,760
Same here, right

244
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,830
Relax a little like this

245
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,330
Yes, like holding chopsticks

246
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,130
Here too

247
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,900
Turn it gently like this

248
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,800
Here too

249
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,870
turn gently

250
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,840
Come on

251
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,310
Don't hold it so tightly

252
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,570
Come and try

253
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,240
one two three go

254
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,540
cross

255
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,510
Yes, hold it

256
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,310
Right this hand

257
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,750
like holding chopsticks

258
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,120
What's up

259
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,990
nothing

260
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,180
What's up

261
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,760
nothing

262
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,990
I'm going to the toilet

263
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I must save him

264
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,270
good

265
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,040
To prevent your consciousness from getting lost

266
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,940
We'll make one for you

267
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,610
Reminder applet

268
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,020
Is there anything between you and him?

269
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,520
something particularly important

270
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,350
or object

271
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,320
object pair

272
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,320
tonight

273
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,590
Are you going to make something delicious?

274
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,590
what do you want to eat

275
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,560
Let's do whatever

276
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,560
I want to eat

277
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,060
Sweet and sour pork ribs

278
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,600
braised tenderloin

279
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,030
and

280
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,210
happy world

281
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,220
Find out

282
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,460
What's wrong, Chunyu?

283
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Hello

284
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,660
water paradise

285
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,530
Find out

286
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,470
No need. Thank you.

287
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,540
Let's go

288
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,240
What else did you just say?

289
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,280
I I forgot

290
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,420
What happened today

291
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,360
startled

292
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,830
I originally said I would cook for you.

293
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,500
In the end, I bought so many snacks

294
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,670
Doesn’t this make you tired?

295
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,030
Know

296
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,600
Right

297
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,940
Why haven't you seen me before?

298
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,040
Are you so good at eating snacks?

299
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,440
Were we together before?

300
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,380
So now it's sweeter

301
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
I want to eat this

302
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,350
ice cream

303
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
Gao Xuan, do you remember?

304
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,620
When I was young

305
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,720
Every time I pass by here

306
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,950
You will buy me one

307
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,590
ice cream

308
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,390
Who is Gao Xuan?

309
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,430
I mean

310
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,630
Brother Xiaolei

311
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,730
Then wait for me from here for a while

312
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,400
I'll buy it

313
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,180
young lady

314
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,540
Gao Xuan

315
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,740
How many times do I remind you

316
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,270
Why don't you read the seal?

317
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,470
Tell me every time

318
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,470
Take him out

319
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
But every time I go in, it's still like this

320
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,110
what are you thinking

321
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,820
spring rain

322
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,220
I know your feelings for Gao Xuan

323
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,960
That's why we recovered

324
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,660
this system

325
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,290
But let you in

326
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,160
It's for you to save him

327
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,700
You two come out together

328
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,800
instead of

329
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,940
spring rain

330
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,510
I've lost your mother

331
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,040
Can't lose you again

332
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,580
dad

333
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,110
You let me in again

334
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,510
I will definitely take him out this time

335
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,410
no

336
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,680
your memory

337
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,020
Already with his fantasy

338
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
interfering with each other

339
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,620
If this continues

340
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,620
very dangerous

341
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,590
Both of you will be stuck in it.

342
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,790
Dad, I beg

343
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,690
Say no more

344
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,760
That's it for today

345
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
You go back and rest

346
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,030
Let’s talk about it later

347
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,680
This house

348
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,120
No one has lived there for a long time

349
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,420
I didn't expect anyone to move in.

350
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,390
It's raining

351
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,600
I remember when you were little

352
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,200
Live here

353
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,340
That little boy

354
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,110
Forgetting means forgetting

355
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,580
Don't take it seriously

356
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,610
Where is this person?

357
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,880
That's it

358
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,650
No matter how good you were before

359
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,350
later

360
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,550
He doesn't come to you

361
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,190
You don't go to him either

362
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,830
You'll all forget about it gradually, right?

363
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,710
It’s time to eat soon

364
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,970
Where are you going?

365
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,910
I'm going to find him

366
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,910
You said this child

367
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,480
It's windy and it's raining

368
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,180
Which muscle is cramped again?

369
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,600
dad

370
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,670
This time I will definitely

371
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,500
can bring him out

372
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,100
Believe me

373
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,540
sit

374
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,750
Brother Xiaolei

375
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,190
spring rain

376
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,430
you're awake

377
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,330
I just wanted to cook

378
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,700
Take a knife and cut the onions

379
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,440
Are you thirsty?

380
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,270
Let me get you a glass of water

381
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,380
In fact, you have seen it all, right?

382
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,980
what

383
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,850
that is

384
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,150
While in the supermarket

385
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,190
that clown

386
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,490
There are also leather figurines

387
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,430
you have seen it all

388
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,060
like me

389
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,770
Sorry, Chunyu

390
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,310
Recently I don't know why

391
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,340
always see some

392
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,580
messy things

393
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,980
I didn't know you could see it too

394
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,920
But don't worry

395
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,420
It should all be an illusion

396
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,260
Those ones

397
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,260
Those are not hallucinations

398
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,900
it's us together

399
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,100
things experienced

400
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,840
Now these

401
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,110
It's an illusion

402
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,150
what did you say

403
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,020
How could this be an illusion?

404
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,990
Brother Xiaolei

405
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,430
in the real world

406
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,000
Your name is not Zhao Lei

407
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,470
You changed your name to Gao Xuan

408
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
We are designed

409
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,670
Entered a

410
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,940
A horror game called Nineteenth Floor

411
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,640
our friends

412
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,680
Keep dying in the game

413
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,080
in reality

414
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,550
Falling into coma one after another

415
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,580
But no matter what

416
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,120
you are always by my side

417
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,390
guard me

418
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,360
protect me

419
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,430
The result is final

420
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,700
To save me then

421
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,670
Trapped one's consciousness

422
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
In this system

423
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,140
Your consciousness constructed this

424
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,710
perfect world

425
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,180
here

426
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,710
Your mother didn't leave

427
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,680
your dad

428
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,020
Didn't die from alcoholism

429
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,590
I

430
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,120
My mother is also very healthy

431
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,660
Our two families

432
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,090
All very happy together

433
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,260
the two of us

434
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,030
Also happily together

435
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,780
That's it

436
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,980
is it bad

437
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,350
good

438
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,150
its good

439
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,120
it's so good

440
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,990
But that's not true

441
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,330
if we continue like this

442
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,130
You'll be stuck here forever

443
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,100
Me too

444
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,310
Brother Xiaolei

445
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,580
Do you remember this?

446
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
My name is Chunyu

447
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,230
And you

448
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,340
It will help you laugh in the future

449
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,750
Run quickly

450
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Come with me quickly

451
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,160
What's your name?

452
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,890
Gao Xuan

453
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,990
It seems like we are here

454
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,890
everyday world

455
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,600
is the same

456
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,730
But it's completely different

457
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,520
But you still feel pain

458
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,420
After I help you deal with it

459
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,550
Will recover better

460
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,520
As long as you want to continue

461
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,220
this game

462
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,390
I won't leave

463
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,090
No matter what they did

464
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,030
what kind of decision

465
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,560
I will always be with you

466
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,930
Let’s save Qingyou together

467
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,740
Gao Xuan

468
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,240
thank you

469
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,510
everything you do for me

470
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,940
I will never forget it

471
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,950
It's OK

472
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,750
It's okay, don't be afraid

473
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,720
I am I am

474
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,630
no matter what happens

475
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,360
I won't give up on you

476
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,630
I will always be by your side

477
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,530
I am here

478
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,870
Your dad will be fine

479
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,390
spring rain

480
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,190
The smile is almost gone

481
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,040
This is what my dad gave us

482
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,170
A reminder program set

483
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,580
When the smile completely disappears

484
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,810
We can never get out again

485
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,810
What are you waiting for?

486
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,030
Even if you take him out

487
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,190
due to consciousness factor

488
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,300
interference effect

489
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,100
he may lose

490
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,430
all the memories of you

491
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,340
What's wrong, Chunyu?

492
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,270
Are you still worried about anything?

493
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,950
nothing

494
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,980
Let's go

495
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,620
let's go

496
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,030
Come

497
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,040
Go and press it

498
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,690
What's up

499
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,500
Can't bear to leave my dream

500
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,160
spring rain

501
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,390
do not worry

502
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,100
our future

503
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,200
It will definitely be better than here

504
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,530
happier

505
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,230
i assure you
