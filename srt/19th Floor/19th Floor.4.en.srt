1
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,650
Maybe if you want to escape

2
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,885
With the ID tags in our hands

3
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,519
It matters

4
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,287
This may be Dan Xing's singing tune

5
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,422
I am a student

6
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,624
I am pure

7
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,494
Brother, why is it chasing you?

8
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,908
please help me

9
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,642
it's coming

10
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,576
Then you promise me

11
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,577
from now on

12
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,611
Work with everyone

13
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,179
I promise you

14
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,413
I'll listen to whatever you say

15
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,947
hold

16
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,158
Where is the spring rain?

17
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,130
What is Chunyu doing?

18
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,002
Change cards

19
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,578
spring rain

20
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,080
Ayong

21
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,749
Brother Qiang, the Nian beast is missing

22
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,049
Ayong

23
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:43,616
are you okay

24
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,083
saved

25
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:44,851
saved

26
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:45,852
Scared me to death

27
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:46,919
are you okay

28
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm fine

29
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,821
we all survived

30
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,322
It turns out that this card

31
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,223
Not just singing

32
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,090
The corresponding fatal card

33
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,325
It's also the key to unlocking the door.

34
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,060
Uncertain factors here

35
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,661
There are many more

36
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:55,928
Let's go out first and talk

37
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:56,929
right

38
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,064
good

39
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,298
Come and go

40
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,098
Go, go, go

41
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,281
Let me tell you

42
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,382
Just now a few of us

43
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,817
It's really too risky

44
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,485
Almost

45
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,820
All of us are obsessed with that monster

46
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,221
Eaten alive

47
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,023
All this is thanks to Chunyu

48
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,091
It was she who opened the door

49
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:25,825
saved us

50
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,694
I don’t like hearing what you say.

51
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,462
If it weren't for this brother

52
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,663
Tell us to change the cards

53
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,198
How can I wait until she opens the door?

54
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,133
But if you don't open the door

55
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,868
Everything before is of no use.

56
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:36,736
It depends on us

57
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,171
Precise cooperation of everyone

58
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,039
With the guidance of my brother

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,007
Otherwise she would be alone

60
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,941
I can't do this either.

61
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,909
You are arrogant

62
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,811
What do you call Liquciqiong?

63
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:45,745
Okay, don't make any noise

64
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,014
It's their tacit cooperation

65
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,549
That allowed us to pass smoothly

66
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,117
They are all excellent

67
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,285
They are all our saviors

68
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,486
That's right, brother

69
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,587
What's your name?

70
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,060
Gao Xuan

71
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:02,829
OK

72
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,797
Then start from today

73
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,365
we are

74
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,699
Good brothers who have been through life and death.

75
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,134
After going out

76
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,469
If you have something to say, please speak

77
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:10,703
OK

78
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,171
I hope that after I go out

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:12,905
can you still remember

80
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,374
How is that possible?

81
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,108
That's the kind of person he is

82
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,808
Definitely don't remember

83
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,043
You can also find me

84
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,645
I, Zhang Tianqiang, keep my word.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,547
Right A Yong

86
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:21,981
right

87
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,216
Let's go

88
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:38,464
This

89
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,899
Damn it

90
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,300
Why are you back?

91
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,135
spring rain

92
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,936
This is exactly the same

93
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:44,971
No, A Yong

94
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:45,905
Let's go back

95
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:46,339
Walk

96
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,145
this this

97
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,249
The position of the door has changed this time

98
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,052
It seems that this game must continue

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,821
If according to just

100
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,889
Rules discovered by Chunyu

101
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:03,890
every aria

102
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,824
There are corresponding doors.

103
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,159
We should first confirm

104
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:06,859
Corresponding to each door

105
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,627
What kind of singing is it?

106
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,361
then follow

107
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,762
Their respective identity cards are in place.

108
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:10,963
Do you understand?

109
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,165
go ahead

110
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,666
Go, go, go

111
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,367
quick

112
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,134
Shengdan is clean and ugly

113
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,002
A total of five arias

114
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,804
Blank cards should be safe cards

115
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,571
This was originally yours

116
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,238
You take it

117
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,179
Why is this blank card

118
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,246
Can't give it to me

119
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,181
Aqiang

120
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:30,817
Teamwork

121
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,229
Why did you lie to us during the day?

122
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,730
I thought

123
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,399
This is a dream

124
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,667
Think about it

125
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,968
I fought with Cai

126
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,336
A little girl who meets you

127
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,305
Just say that I dreamed about her in my dream at night

128
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,606
Is this appropriate?

129
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,777
Let's switch

130
00:07:59,412 --> 00:07:59,946
spring rain

131
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,668
This is

132
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,704
It’s the singing tune of the last line

133
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:25,771
The end door is here

134
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,443
careful

135
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:06,979
It's life

136
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,781
elder brother

137
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,815
Born here Born here

138
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,483
Hurry up

139
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,651
Send this and this back

140
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,489
Brother Qiang

141
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,065
I don't know you

142
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,132
Have you noticed?

143
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,701
My agile skills just now

144
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,868
Strong posture

145
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,770
I am the god who is looking for the door tonight

146
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,204
right

147
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:06,772
yes

148
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,207
It's called the Door God, right?

149
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:10,209
But ah

150
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,211
I am a person who has one thing to say.

151
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,079
I can't say

152
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,347
Just bragging about myself

153
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,148
I think all of us today

154
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,650
They all work together pretty well.

155
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,018
It won't be long

156
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,586
We will all be able to go out

157
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,187
right

158
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,455
Brother Qiang, you are so awesome

159
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,255
You got stuck

160
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:23,856
spring rain

161
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,324
What's wrong with you

162
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,161
If my guess is right

163
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,198
push the door open

164
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,100
It should be a new cycle

165
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:36,969
what do you mean

166
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,305
Infinite loop

167
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,342
Are you saying that Shengdan is pure and ugly?

168
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,977
We walked through two doors

169
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,178
There will be

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
This is related to the number of times the door is opened

171
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,415
Does it matter?

172
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,282
I guess

173
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,251
It’s time to go through the ugly cycle of birth and death

174
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,020
Only then will new information appear

175
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,454
that's us

176
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,989
I have to walk three more times

177
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,062
It's okay, everyone

178
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:04,664
We've all discovered it

179
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,398
its rules

180
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,466
When soldiers come, they will be blocked, and when water comes, soil will cover them up.

181
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,267
Say it again

182
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:08,768
we cooperate

183
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,669
They are becoming more and more understanding

184
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,003
If according to Chunyu

185
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,904
Just analyzed

186
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,539
We still have a lot of money left

187
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,240
these three times

188
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,008
We can definitely break out

189
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,209
It's this

190
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,145
Gao Xuan is right

191
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,680
We can definitely do it

192
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,414
come on

193
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,048
come on

194
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:22,782
come on

195
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:23,683
Come on

196
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,684
Anyway, I'm here

197
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,584
Go Go

198
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,263
The position of the door each time

199
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,197
There will be changes

200
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,098
we must be in

201
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,166
Before the Nian beast appeared

202
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,067
Find and hand cards

203
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,301
The corresponding door position

204
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:43,602
Not sure yet

205
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,970
Singing tunes that have already appeared

206
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,138
Will it appear again?

207
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,640
Everyone must work together

208
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,574
to pass the test

209
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,525
Clean room

210
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:07,827
It's the Jingmen

211
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:08,961
Quiet

212
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:54,774
Shi Danqiang

213
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:55,941
Ayong

214
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,209
good

215
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,317
Great

216
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,767
It’s the singing tune of the last line

217
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:22,902
spring rain

218
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,884
Hurry up

219
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,086
elder brother

220
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,688
This trick really works

221
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,823
It works, it really works

222
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:44,924
Just a little tired

223
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,059
As long as we can get out

224
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,927
Then find Hei Er

225
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,295
everything is worth it

226
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:50,963
The fifth lap

227
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:54,800
That's all the business

228
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,601
It's all gone

229
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,303
That means we

230
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,571
Going out soon

231
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,372
possible

232
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:02,775
So what are you waiting for?

233
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,143
It’s time to work hard

234
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:05,945
After going out

235
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,246
Brother will take you to eat something delicious

236
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,013
my treat

237
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,415
Iron pot stew

238
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:09,882
good

239
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,482
Walk

240
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,321
Right away

241
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,565
I can see this

242
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,168
This is a closed loop

243
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:32,905
I don't play anymore

244
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,406
I don't play anymore

245
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,008
I don't play anymore

246
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,378
Let's keep running like this

247
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,013
This physical strength is limited

248
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,181
This runs to the end

249
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:42,982
I'm not exhausted yet

250
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:44,516
I can not

251
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,118
I need to take a break first

252
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,628
so what

253
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,496
So are you giving up?

254
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,498
Everyone

255
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,066
Shengdan is clean and ugly

256
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,301
We have completed five rounds

257
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,270
We found the pattern

258
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,638
If there is new information

259
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,107
maybe this time

260
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,108
can we succeed

261
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,743
Hold on a little longer

262
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,679
believe in ourselves

263
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,813
Maybe

264
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,215
come on

265
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,456
Brother, let's go

266
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,028
Go ahead

267
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,062
My door is right here

268
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,902
Just keep holding on

269
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,974
uncle

270
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:44,843
this this

271
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,648
Let me see how many rounds you have made

272
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,683
Haven't moved much

273
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,285
Otherwise, our round

274
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:53,986
Change it

275
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,854
let me take a breath

276
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,588
Just one round

277
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,189
one round

278
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,826
I'm here this time

279
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,561
you are very close

280
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,096
Can we just switch to another round?

281
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:04,730
Another round

282
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:05,564
Another round

283
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,332
Then this

284
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:08,734
Just take a break

285
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:09,902
OK OK

286
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,270
Thank you uncle

287
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,237
Thank you

288
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,419
I'm here

289
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,420
How is everyone doing?

290
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,401
uncle

291
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,535
What's going on there?

292
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,436
Has the card been changed?

293
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,804
It's okay

294
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,439
Let me change with uncle

295
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,040
run a few rounds

296
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,707
I'm tired from running

297
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,508
Wait for me to catch my breath

298
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,328
really weird

299
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,730
Why didn't the radio sound this time?

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,968
The radio hasn't sounded yet

301
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,169
Which card should we insert?

302
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:44,930
Brother Qiang, run quickly

303
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,565
This time I’m chasing blank cards.

304
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:47,766
Blank

305
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,407
Why is it always me?

306
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:56,642
run faster

307
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,643
run careful

308
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,411
everyone

309
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,646
We insert cards at the same time

310
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,413
See if it's useful

311
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,493
No response

312
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,028
I can’t do this either.

313
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,666
Help, who can save me?

314
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,212
Quiet

315
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,718
Brother Qiang

316
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,023
give me the cards

317
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,483
Ayong

318
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,120
Ayong

319
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:18,557
Ayong

320
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:29,902
Ayong

321
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,037
Ayong

322
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,218
Ayong

323
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,054
elder brother

324
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,491
Change the cards

325
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,219
elder brother

326
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:35,534
Brother Qiang

327
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,735
Quick card change

328
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,503
Please change your cards quickly

329
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,043
elder brother

330
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:46,678
good

331
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,646
good

332
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,401
elder brother

333
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,638
help me

334
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,541
spring rain

335
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,549
spring rain

336
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:00,932
careful

337
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,367
The danger is not over yet

338
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,135
What happened to that card just now?

339
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,804
The card will automatically return to

340
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,905
In the hands of those without cards

341
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:07,606
We just

342
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,573
Just took advantage of this

343
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,534
Congratulations everyone

344
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,902
Clear customs smoothly

345
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,105
Congratulations everyone

346
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,373
Clear customs smoothly

347
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,481
Give me back my brother Ayong

348
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,982
Give it back to me

349
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,785
Give it back to me

350
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,365
There are already relatively mature domestic

351
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,800
A company researching artificial intelligence

352
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,702
Brain-Computer Interface Technology

353
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,170
It is also at the forefront of the world

354
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,006
What you said may not be possible

355
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,309
Understand

356
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,801
spring rain

357
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,003
Are we again

358
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,004
Ayong

359
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:26,805
Ayong

360
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:27,572
Someone coming

361
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:28,773
Is there anyone

362
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:29,974
Ayong

363
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,376
Ayong

364
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,177
Ayong

365
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,179
You, don’t scare brother

366
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:34,612
What's wrong with you

367
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,281
Ayong

368
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,248
Is there anyone

369
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,083
Help

370
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,017

371
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,019
Ah Yong, don’t scare brother

372
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,120
Don't scare me

373
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:42,987
Don't scare brother

374
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,223
Ayong

375
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,291
nurse

376
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:48,660
What's wrong? This is

00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:50,528
Hurry up

378
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,297
I can't wake him up no matter what I do.

379
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,500
Coma on bed 13

380
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,267
Prepare for first aid

381
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:56,801
first aid

382
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,268

383
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:57,969
Give it a minute Give it a minute

384
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:58,636
Ready for first aid

385
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,170
Give it a moment

386
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,041
doctor doctor

387
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,346
Prepare for defibrillation

388
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,359
Get out of bed

389
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,682
What took so long?

390
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,683
Not coming out yet

391
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,453
give me the cards

392
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:49,888
elder brother

394
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,294
spring rain

395
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,695
You said A Yong

396
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,097
You won't be able to wake up, right?

397
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:01,900
have no idea

398
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,738
you say

399
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,239
Could it be because of A Yong?

400
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,574
Something happened in the ghost house

401
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,843
That’s why it became like this now

402
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,212
What kind of building is this?

403
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:15,780
Is there something wrong with your brain?

404
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,347
That's a dream

405
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,081
don't you know

406
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,650
What's the use of breaking the jar?

407
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,652
If you have time, why not think more about it

408
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,486
What to do

409
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,654
Take care of yourself

410
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:29,961
Doctor

411
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:30,695
Doctor

412
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:33,464
I

413
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,799
What's going on with my brother?

414
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,135
The patient is currently in a coma

415
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,870
The initial diagnosis was alcoholism.

416
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:39,904
we have already done

417
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:40,905
necessary measures

418
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,640
If the effect is ideal

419
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,108
Consciousness can be restored within today

420
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,211
But if the condition worsens later,

421
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,212
we will transfer him to

422
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:47,812
intensive care unit

423
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,415
Alcohol poisoning is fine

424
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,216
Doctor

425
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,685
Are you sure it's alcohol poisoning?

426
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:54,853
how much to drink

427
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,821
Alcoholism varies from person to person

428
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,456
and how much to drink

429
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,257
Drinking quantity

430
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,458
Drinking type

431
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,960
blood alcohol concentration

432
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:02,694
Content

433
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,362
and personal tolerance level

434
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,163
It all matters

435
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,198
Do you want to drink or not?

436
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,200
Hurry up

437
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,136
You are a doctor and he is a doctor

438
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:13,738
you don't understand anything

439
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:14,539
Just don't talk nonsense

440
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,541
Doctor

441
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,376
It's okay for us here

442
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,010
Sorry to trouble you

443
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:19,978
Thank you

444
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,327
If he is really alcoholic

445
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:37,528
How is it possible

446
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,830
Come with us to the ghost house

447
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,066
So I tell you

448
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,934
He drank too much

449
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,202
Who said drinking too much?

450
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:44,869
Can't dream

451
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,371
But you said yesterday

452
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,438
this is not a dream

453
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,507
Why did it suddenly happen again today?

454
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:51,542
Brother Qiang

455
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,611
Where is Hei Er?

456
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,187
I don't know where he is

457
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,622
He was discharged from the hospital alone

458
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:06,691
That brat

459
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:07,558
don't know where to go

460
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,059
alone

461
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,093
Leave his brother here

462
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,329
Is he really discharged from hospital?

463
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,597
The doctors said he was discharged from the hospital

464
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,132
You go ask the doctor why you asked me

465
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:14,933
I

466
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,067
we were together last night

467
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,168
Appear in the ghost house

468
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,870
Now your two good brothers

469
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,405
one missing

470
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,639
a coma

471
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,708
Last night's broadcast

472
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,542
you heard it too

473
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,982
Congratulations to everyone for successfully passing customs

474
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,920
This is definitely not just a dream

475
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:36,788
So simple

476
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,094
spring rain

477
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,696
It's all so weird

478
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,563
Otherwise, let's call the police.

479
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,197
is it good

480
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:46,998
right

481
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:48,566
Too strange

482
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,001
Alarm

483
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:51,736
Wait first

484
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:52,937
Why

485
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,173
Now Guilou and Ayong

486
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:55,807
their condition

487
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,008
Is there any connection?

488
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,443
It's all just our guesses

489
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,477
no evidence

490
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,412
and we want

491
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,613
How to explain to the police

492
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,183
Said we fell asleep last night

493
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,018
Entered a strange space

494
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,020
The shadow puppets inside have come to life.

495
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,254
Still killing people

496
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,758
The police will think

497
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,959
The three of us are crazy

498
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,600
Hello Chunyu

499
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,335
I am Nian Sulan, President of the Student Union

500
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,037
The school asked me to take you back

501
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,005
You guys pack your bags quickly

502
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:27,372
Come down

503
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,106
good

504
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:31,509
Fine

505
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,477
Then go back first

506
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,679
If A Yong wakes up

507
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,381
I'll tell you right away

508
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,588
Remember to keep looking for Hei Er

509
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,023
Maybe I found him

510
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,357
We have the answer

511
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,961
What did you say to that person?

512
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:50,661
exactly the same

513
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,497
With whom

514
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:54,465
Gao Xuan

515
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,367
He told me the same thing yesterday

516
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,343
Senior sister

517
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,282
Are you here to pick us up?

518
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,384
I can't get used to the school bus

519
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,419
I sent my own driver

520
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,219
Come to pick you up

521
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,221
The car is a bit small

522
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,923
Don't dislike it, school girl

523
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:20,858
This is still small

524
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,693
Get in the car

525
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:46,984
classmate

526
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:47,985
Senior Gao Xuan

527
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,320
I want to be in school

528
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,455
3D model

529
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,189
It's still bad now

530
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,390
Drawings of Building No. 19

531
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,524
Want to trouble you

532
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,126
Help me apply with Director Liu

533
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,028
Okay, senior

534
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:00,598
Senior sister

535
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:01,799
our school

536
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,568
There is a senior named Gao Xuan

537
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,001
Really?

538
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:04,602
Yes

539
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,571
Senior Gao Xuan

540
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,439
Is a graduate student at the University of Science and Technology

541
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,941
Because he is in our school now

542
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,342
Part-time substitute teacher

543
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,643
But he should

544
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,178
I'll come over and teach for one semester.

545
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,881
Be a substitute teacher

546
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,216
yes

547
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,251
But his main business

548
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,186
He should still be considered a student, right?

549
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,020
Actually he should

550
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,322
Just two years older than you

551
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,723
It's a university where I skipped a grade.

552
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:26,657
Also in the past few years

553
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,892
Rising Stars in Technology

554
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,027
do you know him

555
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,897
Don't know

556
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:33,998
Just a casual question

557
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:37,668
That's right

558
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,103
I'm different

559
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,171
He is mine

560
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,839
Where is the graduation thesis advisor?
