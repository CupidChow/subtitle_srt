1
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,225
Is Director Liu still in the hospital?

2
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,660
The children who had an accident yesterday

3
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,194
Are you all awake?

4
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,762
Director Liu and I are both in the hospital

5
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,497
We are taking our classmates back

6
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,232
There are two girls still awake

7
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,238
Quiet

8
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,442
spring rain

9
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,144
spring rain

10
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,481
i had a nightmare

11
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:43,783
It's OK

12
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,385
It's dawn

13
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,922
But that nightmare was particularly terrifying

14
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,058
I dreamed of a ghost building

15
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,394
The shadow puppets in the ghost building came to life

16
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,629
And then he hunted us down

17
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,632
Do you remember that building

18
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,867
Is there anything strange?

19
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,068
have no idea

20
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:05,638
However

21
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,841
But it looks a bit familiar

22
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,612
Isn't this the legendary

23
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,613
That building?

24
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,951
I I remembered

25
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,453
It's our school

26
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,587
Building 19

27
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,271
Don't move

28
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,305
I call doctor

29
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,141
Doctor

30
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,910
My classmate’s head is bleeding

31
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,211
Please come and take a look

32
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,279
alright, please wait

33
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,313
The doctor will be here soon

34
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,423
Spring rain, right?

35
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,393
In ward 303

36
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,060
Thank you

37
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,028
You are welcome

38
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:03,956
Dr. Jia

39
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,661
Originally the appointment was for tomorrow

40
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,062
But I said hello

41
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,297
You can have a checkup today

42
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,232
Thank you Dr. Jia

43
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:13,900
You're welcome

44
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,469
Just now you said

45
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,537
We both were in a coma for a day

46
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,371
It's because of a car accident

47
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,338
concussion

48
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:20,706
It's a mild concussion

49
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,241
It's normal to be in a coma for a day

50
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,476
Don't be too nervous

51
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,311
That concussion

52
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,112
will make two people

53
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,346
Do you have the same dream?

54
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,321
What does it mean specifically?

55
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,760
nothing

56
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:43,996
You two brains

57
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,031
All have minor injuries

58
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,265
What symptoms occur

59
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,200
It's also normal

60
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:48,534
but if

61
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,535
something strange happened

62
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:50,536
tell me in time

63
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,737
Don't over-interpret

64
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,880
Chunyu, you just talked about two people

65
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:01,481
have the same dream

66
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,281
What does it mean?

67
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,922
This patient passed away so suddenly.

68
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,957
Isn't it?

69
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,425
I heard you were fine last night

70
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,659
Who knows when you wake up

71
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,594
People can't do it

72
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,371
You were also in a car accident

73
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,973
We are on the bus

74
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,075
They were the ones who killed us

75
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:29,775
Can't talk nonsense

76
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,476
not us not us

77
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,078
I told you we are not dead

78
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,417
Hello

79
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,120
The phone you dialed is turned off

80
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:41,587
sorry

81
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,957
The phone you dialed is turned off

82
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,158
elder brother

83
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,094
Shut down

84
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,664
What should I do?

85
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,299
Is it possible that something will really happen to Hei Er?

86
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,433
impossible

87
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,635
three of us

88
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,135
Came in together

89
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,236
Something is going to happen to him

90
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,237
Will definitely notify both of us

91
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,140
I still feel wrong

92
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,142
You said we were inexplicable

93
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:03,976
Had the same dream

94
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,511
In the dream, Hei Er was still dead

95
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,512
Then we both woke up

96
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,346
Can't find anyone else yet

97
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,082
Do you think he should

98
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:15,655
What should happen

99
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,225
Could it be that it's not a dream?

100
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,427
Is it true?

101
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,850
Ayong

102
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,157
Then you mean

103
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,695
The shadow puppet monster we encountered before

104
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,996
It's all true

105
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,267
What should I do, brother?

106
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:04,570
Otherwise, your brother and I

107
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,838
Let me give you a new head

108
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,944
Your brain was hit by a car, right?

109
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,713
What are you thinking about?

110
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,714
To eat or not to eat

111
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,217
I really follow you day and night

112
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,021
You use yours

113
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,689
Think about it with a wise mind

114
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,791
How could this not be a dream?

115
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,660
before us

116
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,661
On this hospital bed

117
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,795
after waking up

118
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,097
Still on this hospital bed

119
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,098
right?

120
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,467
Have a meal

121
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,874
That's Hei Er

122
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,842
He's not in the hospital bed

123
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,076
no

124
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,111
I have to find him

125
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:45,878
what are you doing

126
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,784
Ayong

127
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,800
Ayong

128
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,069
Ayong

129
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,304
Ah Yong, that's enough

130
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,540
Ayong

131
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:16,842
Ayong

132
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,513
I can't call you now

133
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:20,980
right

134
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,186
Calm down now

135
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,387
Do you believe me?

136
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,455
Hei Er is absolutely fine

137
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,223
Because I think this matter

138
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:31,857
from beginning to end

139
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,025
It's just a prank

140
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,460
The kind of escape room

141
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:35,494
Maybe

142
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,429
Hei Er also participated

143
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:37,797
Think about it

144
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,331
Hei Er before him

145
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,533
I like doing this kind of tricks the most

146
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,200
Scare us

147
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,069
Really

148
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,036
Sure

149
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:47,673
impossible

150
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,708
Black mobile phone

151
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,742
24 hours a day without shutting down

152
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:50,409
If he turns off his phone

153
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,544
Something must have happened

154
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,812
Then use your brain to think about it

155
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,113
Yesterday we met that group of people

156
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,081
How strange

157
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,182
Think about that

158
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,451
The girl with a black face the whole time

159
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,119
Trade yours with me

160
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:01,954
fair

161
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,956
He doesn't talk much, but he is so cruel

162
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:05,858
And that smiling tiger boy

163
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,260
I really can't trust you

164
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,762
He is not panic at all

165
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,063
what happened

166
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,997
It's all under his control

167
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,467
Those people are definitely not

168
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,701
Real people in reality

169
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,536
Don't think about it now

170
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,871
Brother Xin’s Hei Er is fine

171
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,073
Silly boy, go back

172
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,681
What's wrong with you

173
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,218
real person

174
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,796
How could it be

175
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,231
the two of us

176
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,665
I actually had the same nightmare

177
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,268
I think

178
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,272
This is not necessarily a dream

179
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,613
you you mean

180
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,781
it's all true

181
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,851
It shouldn't be

182
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:06,919
when we wake up

183
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:07,586
Obviously in the hospital

184
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,021
Not in Building 19

185
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,356
Is it possible

186
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,291
Could it be possible that there was someone there in the middle of the night?

187
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,292
Pushed us out

188
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,961
But that doesn't make sense

189
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:16,595
spring rain

190
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,231
Quiet

191
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,000
I finally found you

192
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,835
Mom, why are you here?

193
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,069
I bought you breakfast

194
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,271
The nurse came back and said

195
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,972
you are all awake

196
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,641
I didn't see you either

197
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,308
I'm so anxious

198
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,111
How can I pay this back?

199
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,212
It was fine yesterday

200
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,079
Why did you cover your head?

201
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,014
Mom, don't move

202
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,415
There was bleeding this morning

203
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,283
The doctor has seen it

204
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,050
wait here

205
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:38,951
Doing a tomography scan?

206
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:39,652
Let me see

207
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,853
Just waiting for the tomography scan

208
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,854
Mom, stop looking

209
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,522
It's bleeding. Let me take a look.

210
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,623
Mom, don't move

211
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,491
You

212
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm not a child anymore

213
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,627
There are people here

214
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:49,829
Aunt

215
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,064
Chunyu also woke up

216
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,800
Why are you alone?

217
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,469
Didn't the school notify your home?

218
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,239
The teacher asked me for my phone number

219
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,674
I didn't ask them to notify my grandma

220
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,108
What about your dad?

221
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,177
Mom

222
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,380
Why are you two here?

223
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,682
What about the rest

224
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,784
What other people?

225
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,153
No, wasn't it a collision between two cars?

226
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,855
The nurse told me

227
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,122
Many people are hospitalized

228
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:32,771
your map

229
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,273
Can I also take a look?

230
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,341
Hei Er can't be real

231
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,552
Twelve beds

232
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,553
You haven't recovered from your illness yet

233
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,554
Why are you running around?

234
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:50,689
nurse

235
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:51,590
I want to ask

236
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,758
The person who had a car accident yesterday

237
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:53,993
Except our ward 03

238
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,794
Where do everyone else live?

239
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:56,629
at

240
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:58,864
little sister

241
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,599
Claims can be made through formal channels

242
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,067
Don't be impulsive.

243
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,102
you misunderstood

244
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,737
I just want to know

245
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,704
How are the students?

246
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:06,538
your classmate

247
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,973
Isn’t there only eleven beds?

248
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,141
Everyone else had minor injuries

249
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,042
The school has sent people

250
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,743
Brought them all back

251
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,178
You'd better observe it for a few more days

252
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:13,879
Discharged again

253
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,414
I really can't stay any longer

254
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,115
Doctor

255
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,416
Don't you think I'm fine?

256
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,017
right

257
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,318
What about this school?

258
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,053
School has just started and there are so many things going on

259
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:21,720
It's him

260
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,155
The cafeteria makes several calls a day

261
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,623
I have to go back today

262
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,358
Excuse me, doctor.

263
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:29,428
All right

264
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:30,829
Then you must remember

265
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,197
Come regularly for review

266
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:33,465
thank you thank you

267
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,468
Thank you, doctor

268
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,274
It's you

269
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,680
do we know each other

270
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:49,815
we are not

271
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,017
Are we riding the school bus together?

272
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,019
then

273
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,788
There was another car accident

274
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,057
You'll remember me as soon as you meet me

275
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,559
Uncle, you have a very good memory.

276
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,494
Yesterday you and a little girl

277
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,595
more seriously injured

278
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,197
I saw you

279
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,699
Was pushed in and rescued

280
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,667
So the impression is deeper

281
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,471
Except for hospitals and school buses

282
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,707
Have we met somewhere else?

283
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,676
like

284
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,280
Not really

285
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,218
Manager phone number

286
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,354
Hello

287
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,222
Will be discharged immediately

288
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,424
Definitely arriving in the evening

289
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:33,559
rest assured

290
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,735
His leg is not injured

291
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,736
Bed 12, it’s time for infusion

292
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,510
If according to what you just said

293
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,411
it's all a dream

294
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,079
then your friend

295
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,880
It should be fine

296
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,853
It seems to make sense

297
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,755
No, are you stupid?

298
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,058
I'm telling you, brat

299
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,227
Don't pretend to be with me here.

300
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,595
Before a few of us followed you

301
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,863
Never seen it at all

302
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,197
i dream at night

303
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,198
why do i dream about you

304
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,235
You were the one doing the trick from beginning to end

305
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,070
My brother owes you money

306
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,073
So Hei Er still owes others money.

307
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:23,709
I'm asking you now

308
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,610
Or are you asking me?

309
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:25,911
I'm warning you

310
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,479
I grew up

311
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,081
He is famous for not taking action lightly or lightly.

312
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,149
Say it quickly

313
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,350
Where is Hei Er?

314
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,623
where is he

315
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,630
morgue

316
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,276
This way

317
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,550
You definitely saw it

318
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,918
Is it my brother Hei Er?

319
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:07,719
On Hei Er's right arm

320
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:08,554
Is there one

321
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,555
Very long scar

322
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:16,662
This way

323
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,677
What are you three doing?

324
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,480
Stand ready

325
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,749
I saw you guys coming in a long time ago

326
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,051
What are you trying to do sneakily?

327
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,620
You are not a good person at first glance

328
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,221
no

329
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,822
we are good people

330
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,990
We just have a friend

331
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,491
missing

332
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,059
Then we wanted to go in and have a look

333
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,794
Your friend is missing

334
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,595
Won't call the police

335
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,063
Why do you come to the morgue?

336
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,400
They have too many people now

337
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,702
Can't get in now

338
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,070
Let's think of other ways

339
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,780
your brother

340
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,182
Already recovered and discharged from hospital

341
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,551
Probably this morning

342
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:13,318
Around eight o'clock

343
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,386
discharge procedures

344
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,491
His signature is flying and phoenix dancing

345
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,026
Like Hei Er's

346
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,028
Yes, yes, it’s Hei Er

347
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,396
patient's hospitalization expenses

348
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,430
All settled

349
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,933
And it was signed by his own name

350
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,669
As for the patient after leaving the hospital

351
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:31,470
where have you gone

352
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,671
Why can't I get through the phone?

353
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,072
These are our hospitals

354
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:34,940
I can't control it anymore

355
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,575
After all he is an adult

356
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:36,942
right

357
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,111
right

358
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,113
What will happen next

359
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,182
You can come to me directly here

360
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,417
Don't wander around in the hospital

361
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,586
Especially like a morgue

362
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,453
such a place

363
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,155
Don't let it happen again

364
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,056
Yes, that's me

365
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,024
Sorry, Director Chen

366
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,392
Indeed today

367
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,393
It's because we didn't see clearly

368
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,260
Acting recklessly

369
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,195
Excuse me

370
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,063
If nothing happens

371
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:58,730
Let's go first

372
00:19:59,064 --> 00:19:59,431
Goodbye

373
00:19:59,631 --> 00:19:59,932
good

374
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:00,599
Walk

375
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,401
Thank you, Director Chen

376
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,412
It's obviously him

377
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,479
Didn't understand the situation

378
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:15,714
Make it look like the two of us

379
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:16,481
Same as doing something wrong

380
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,150
And was scolded as a coward

381
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,818
But Hei Er is really fine

382
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,852
I feel relieved

383
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,054
This time

384
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,322
I can now explain it to my grandma.

385
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,623
It seems last night

386
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,090
We did it

387
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,458
It's really a dream

388
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,402
brother

389
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,038
If you knew something

390
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,106
Don't hide it

391
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,274
Say it

392
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,350
last night

393
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,018
that's not a dream

394
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,723
I was in that building last night

395
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,870
What happened

396
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,738
I am not sure as well

397
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,040
Find your friend Hei Er

398
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,341
Maybe you'll know

399
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,376
all answers

400
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,616
Black Er

401
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,152
are we dead

402
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,553
Could this be hell?

403
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,554
I'm a little scared

404
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:31,823
Quiet

405
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:00,986
Hello

406
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,455
The phone you dialed is switched off

407
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,064
nurse

408
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,065
Eleven patient beds

409
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:13,865
Haven't you come back yet?

410
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,534
Not your classmate?

411
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,601
Call and ask

412
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,070
Thank you

413
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,474
Where are you going again?

414
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,224
sorry

415
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,659
The user you dialed

416
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,160
Unable to connect at the moment

417
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,895
Please call again later

418
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:46,932
where are you

419
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:56,875
spring rain

420
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,579
where did you just go

421
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,346
I'll call you

422
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,180
You won't answer either

423
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,316
My mother was anxious and left first.

424
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,183
then i'm waiting

425
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,551
I fell asleep during the tomography scan.

426
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,719
mute mobile phone

427
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,920
I didn’t see the news

428
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,422
tomography

429
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,523
tomography room

430
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,491
I haven't seen you either

431
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,159
It's Dr. Jia

432
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,560
Take me to his office

433
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,228
sat for a while

434
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,562
It's getting late

435
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:18,830
You guys go back and rest

436
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:20,732
knew

437
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,600
Thank you Dr. Jia

438
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,212
The girl who lives with her

439
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,113
Rejection reaction occurs

440
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,615
Already dealt with

441
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,243
Come on, sake, hurry up

442
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,627
elder brother

443
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,597
I'm still a little worried about Hei Er

444
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:26,932
Do you think he will?

445
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:27,866
Something really happened

446
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,235
What could happen to him?

447
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,637
Just listen to me Ayong

448
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,105
What about us today?

449
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,107
There is wine today. I am drunk today.

450
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:36,741
Maybe

451
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,709
What about when we wake up?

452
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,144
Hei Er will be back soon

453
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,345
right

454
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,079
Come

455
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,081
Sake

456
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,720
Hurry up

457
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,794
Drink or not

458
00:24:59,097 --> 00:24:59,865
If you don’t want to drink, give me a drink.

459
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,938
Why did you get drunk?

460
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,340
Drinking is not allowed in the ward

461
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,708
Do you still want to be discharged from the hospital?

462
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,345
If you want to be discharged from the hospital, you must first recover.

463
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,382
Go to bed early

464
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,638
Isn’t this Hei Er’s mobile phone?

465
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,561
This Ayong

466
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,133
Ayong

467
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,201
I think you should

468
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,469
Be mentally prepared

469
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,340
Black Er

470
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,051
Ayong

471
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,412
This wine

472
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,348
It's pretty strong

473
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,536
Why are you suddenly interested in research?

474
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,839
Interested in brain nerves and dreams

475
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,907
I seemed to have had a dream last night

476
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,976
There are shadow puppets there that can attack people.

477
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,344
Fighting and sensory experience

478
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,145
All very real

479
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,547
And the people I met there

480
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,782
Actually in the real world

481
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,416
Also met

482
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,251
I don't think it was a dream

483
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,186
What do you think about us?

484
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,021
existing technology

485
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,222
can make a group of people

486
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,089
Go to something like

487
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,658
A place in an alien space?

488
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:50,428
This

489
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,597
Why are you here again?

490
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,202
This

491
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,671
How come this dream is still connected?

492
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:00,705
That

493
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,507
So is this still a dream?

494
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,078
It hurts

495
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,012
It hurts

496
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,549
spring rain

497
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,218
This can't be true, can it?

498
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:15,587
Black Er

499
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,154
Ayong

500
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:17,856
Black Er

501
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,424
Why is Hei Er missing?

502
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,593
The shadow puppets are also missing

503
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,495
I still insist

504
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,429
My opinion yesterday

505
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:26,698
and i think

506
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,700
Hei Er may also be involved

507
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:29,701
I do not believe

508
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,570
No matter how much Hei Er likes to play pranks

509
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,072
It's impossible for him to go so far

510
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,306
Then let me ask you

511
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,242
After coming out of the hospital yesterday

512
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:37,942
Did you find him?

513
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,812
So much trouble

514
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,814
It's definitely not a prank

515
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,016
so all this

516
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,351
It's all planned and premeditated

517
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:47,385
Black Er

518
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,787
May have been killed

519
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:50,955
elder brother

520
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:51,723
That if according to

521
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:52,557
what they say

522
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,458
Don't listen to him

523
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,192
Listen to me

524
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,827
Hei Er is absolutely fine

525
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,202
be careful

526
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:04,936
Don't know where

527
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,237
What else will pop out?

528
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,549
This leg, this

529
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,451
These legs are still fine during the day

530
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,786
Why are you lame again now?

531
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,721
Is this really a dream?

532
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,292
Then I would prefer

533
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:27,959
first possibility

534
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,661
Here with us during the day

535
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,261
are parallel

536
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,696
But each has its own rules

537
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,536
Please come to the square pillar

538
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,038
Choose an ID badge

539
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,988
Why is there suddenly another brand?

540
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,196
That's okay

541
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:06,831
Let me see what you can do

542
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,633
last word

543
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,069
What does this last word mean?

544
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,839
Maybe if you want to escape

545
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,541
With the ID tags in our hands

546
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:16,941
It matters

547
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,243
Everyone, please report it

548
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,110
What's on your hands

549
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,611
what are you

550
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:20,778
I am a student

551
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,113
I am pure

552
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:24,582
born

553
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:25,783
Mo Jing

554
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,052
Maybe it has something to do with the opera industry

555
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,554
nothing more than

556
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,989
Is Shengdan Jingmo ugly?

557
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,624
Make it as if you know

558
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,592
spring rain

559
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:35,994
On your card

560
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,061
Why is there nothing?

561
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,329
That's nothing

562
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,097
It's a dead card

563
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,265
You are the dead card

564
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,399
How do you talk?

565
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,400
Ayong

566
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,401
what is in your hand

567
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,135
Mine is

568
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:48,973
we all said it

569
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,174
Why don't you say it?

570
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:50,975
Did I want you to say it?

571
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:51,476
you

572
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,377
Did I beg you to say it?

573
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,077
What you have to say yourself

574
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:53,578
Don't make any noise, everyone

575
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,345
It’s easy to discuss something

576
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,584
Action target: Escape from the lobby

577
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,185
Game starts

578
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,090
what do you mean

579
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,358
started

580
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,027
How, how do you get out?

581
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,942
Looks like the Nian beast

582
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,146
that

583
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,213
that

584
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,650
Aren’t all shadow puppets afraid of light?

585
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,753
Shadow puppets are afraid of light

586
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,323
But the Nian beast may not be afraid

587
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,191
Light may not work on them

588
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,226
Let's stay calm first

589
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,394
see how it goes

590
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,096
You must pay attention

591
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:45,797
you run slowly

592
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:48,933
Moved

593
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:50,735
spring rain

594
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,136
I am afraid

595
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,350
This may be Dan Xing's singing tune

596
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,036
Open the door

597
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:32,737
Change the door

598
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,112
Ayong

599
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,113
Brother Qiang

600
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,193
Nian beast seems to only chase Brother Qiang

601
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,194
Really

602
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:04,235
elder brother

603
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,169
Why is it chasing you?

604
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,137
How would I know

605
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,541
Brother, run quickly

606
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,120
That was on the radio

607
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,255
It should be Dan Xing’s singing style

608
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,114
Run quickly, brother

609
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,682
Ayong, walk, walk, walk

610
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:52,717
Walk

611
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,252
Change it. Change it.

612
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,877
It seems that I can only hold the singing voice

613
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,012
The person corresponding to the ID card

614
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:21,612
will be chased

615
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,782
That's really what happened

616
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,153
Brother, please find a way to save me

617
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:30,755
Ayong

618
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,589
Withstand it

619
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,591
I'm looking for someone to save you

620
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:35,893
Ayong

621
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,594
Big brother

622
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,261
What are you here for?

623
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,563
I beg you

624
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:39,463
we are a team

625
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,098
You think of a way to save my brother

626
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,500
We are not a team

627
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,434
He had an ax yesterday

628
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,202
Want to kill me

629
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,170
Brother, please find a way to save me

630
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:46,704
Ayong

631
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,706
It was my fault yesterday

632
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:49,840
but

633
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,075
It has nothing to do with my brother A Yong

634
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,043
he didn't do anything

635
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:52,910
he didn't do anything

636
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,513
Ayong

637
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,782
Brother Qiang, save me

638
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:58,649
Exchange cards with him yourself

639
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,317
No, that’s fine

640
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,618
I beg, I beg you.

641
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,152
Big brother

642
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,553
Please save my brother

643
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,254
you

644
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,762
It's the melody of scandal

645
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,531
It seems that the vocals will keep changing

646
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:15,433
Ugly

647
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,271
it it

648
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,039
please help me

649
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,976
It's coming. Think of a way.

650
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,344
Then you promise me

651
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,078
from now on

652
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,346
Work with everyone

653
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,213
I promise you

654
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,548
I'll listen to whatever you say

655
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:31,582
hold

656
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,298
Where is the spring rain?

657
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,403
What is Chunyu doing?

658
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,238
What do you care about her?

659
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:54,739
What's wrong

660
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,706
Can she still open the door?

661
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,474
impossible

662
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,241
she does this

663
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,042
Of course she has her reasons

664
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:58,676
What do you know

665
00:37:58,843 --> 00:37:59,944
There's a damn reason

666
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:05,783
Change cards
