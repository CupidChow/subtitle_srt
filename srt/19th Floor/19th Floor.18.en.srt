1
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,342
My little ancestor

2
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,144
Finally woke up

3
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:24,811
you

4
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,546
How are you feeling right now?

5
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,580
much better

6
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,414
grandma

7
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,016
How did I come back?

8
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,620
You scared grandma to death

9
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:34,787
last night

10
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,289
The two girls will send you back

11
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,158
Said you were dizzy and uncomfortable

12
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,259
I just watched

13
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,094
You flopped down on that bed

14
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,428
You won't wake up

15
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,097
How come you don’t know so much?

16
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,366
Do you love your body?

17
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,333
grandma

18
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,968
I want to sleep a little longer

19
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:49,769
What's wrong with you

20
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,437
You need to eat something too

21
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,906
I'll go down to eat soon

22
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:53,973
I'll go eat later.

23
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,642
Okay, hurry up then

24
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,144
Me I'll be waiting for you downstairs

25
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:58,645
good

26
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,445
Hurry up, hurry up

27
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,847
Lie there quickly. Lie there quickly.

28
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:01,981
lie there

29
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,450
Just lie there

30
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,533
Congratulations on passing

31
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,002
Please open the water tank quickly

32
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:23,670
Yan Mingliang

33
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,904
What do you want to do?

34
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,426
Wait a moment

35
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:47,927
Lao Gao will be injured, right?

36
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,539
go over there

37
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,341
Gao Xuan

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,374
Is he out?

39
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,441
no

40
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,009
no

41
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:42,982
Gao Xuan

42
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:45,618
Gao Xuan

43
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,286
Gao Xuan

44
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,603
Congratulations everyone

45
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,105
Game cleared

46
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,506
No, can't exit

47
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,507
Can't exit

48
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,141
Gao Xuan

49
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:42,842
Gao Xuan

50
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:50,983
Gao Xuan

51
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,186
Gao Xuan

52
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,530
it's me

53
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,802
Gao Xuan, just be okay.

54
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,038
Thank you Chunyu

55
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,006
It was you who saved me

56
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,376
Did you save me enough?

57
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,846
where are you

58
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,481
when i wake up

59
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,648
Already in the dormitory

60
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,217
It should be Tianji's person

61
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,051
Send me back

62
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,420
The more they become like this

63
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,055
The less we can give up

64
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,858
There will always be a way to deal with them

65
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,260
light rain

66
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,063
Come and see what this is

67
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,930
Grandma called me

68
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:38,965
I'll tell you later

69
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:40,533
good

70
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,003
Tianji really broke his promise

71
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:18,971
who are you

72
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,239
why help us

73
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,407
But unwilling to show up

74
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,547
If you want me to continue to help you

75
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,448
you can't reveal

76
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,616
Any information I communicate with you

77
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,819
Otherwise my life will be in danger

78
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:33,920
Go to Microtech again

79
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,021
Try the equipment

80
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,389
The pulse equipment there

81
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,090
Requires assembly before use

82
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,826
Microtechnology and secrets

83
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,060
have a very close relationship

84
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,862
What is their relationship?

85
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,167
microtechnology

86
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,770
Technical support equivalent to Tianji

87
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,742
Can I tell this time

88
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:57,577
my friends?

89
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:58,878
Chunyu and the others

90
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,179
Can help me a lot

91
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,424
grandma

92
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,761
You scared grandma to death

93
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,563
Just a head massage?

94
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,098
Are you like this? You

95
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,201
Where did you get this?

96
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,136
This person's courier delivered it.

97
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,371
People just left

98
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,640
I thought you respected me

99
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,342
Don't wear it

100
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,844
Can't wear it

101
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,227
Hello

102
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,829
Have you received the courier?

103
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,297
What do you want to do?

104
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,799
This new product

105
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,334
Very good head massage

106
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,737
Very suitable for the elderly

107
00:08:59,205 --> 00:08:59,572
Hello

108
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:00,640
Hello

109
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,647
Xiaoqin

110
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,781
spring rain

111
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,249
My sister received a courier

112
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,122
They actually gave me a home

113
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,123
A mahjong table was given as a gift

114
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,090
They know everything

115
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,025
Know where I live

116
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,459
I know my dad loves to play mahjong

117
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,627
My dad saw the mahjong table

118
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,762
You have to plug it in and try it

119
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:23,563
Later there was no way

120
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,130
I get a baseball bat

121
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,331
Smashed that mahjong machine

122
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,133
My dad almost beat me up

123
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,568
They gave it back to my brother

124
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,869
I was given a digital watch as a gift

125
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,370
I asked him to throw it away quickly

126
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,372
My wife, too

127
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,206
so funny

128
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,042
He gave us these

129
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:36,809
weird stuff

130
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,877
What exactly does it mean?

131
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,846
Although he didn't say anything

132
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,582
But the meaning is already clear

133
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,716
he is warning us

134
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,017
if we have anything

135
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:45,685
Abnormal behavior

136
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,786
That's dangerous

137
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,620
not just us

138
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,654
And our family

139
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:54,894
What to do?

140
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,762
We can only continue the game

141
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,165
That

142
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,501
Is there no way out?

143
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,803
Why are you just thinking about getting away?

144
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,004
We still have friends in there

145
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:06,939
I

146
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,278
How could Yang Bawan say that?

147
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,813
I just can’t say

148
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,348
Okay, stop arguing

149
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,049
Xiaoqin is right

150
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,417
We still have friends in there

151
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,052
Since there is no other way out

152
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,454
Let's figure it out together

153
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,688
Complete this game

154
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,723
Save them all

155
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,459
But next time I enter the game

156
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,827
We have to be more careful

157
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,662
It must be in the game

158
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,529
survive first

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,164
at the same time in reality

160
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,933
We must try our best to confuse the secrets of heaven

161
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,934
make them feel

162
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,168
We have settled for the status quo

163
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:36,769
right

164
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,237
we need to be more cautious

165
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,006
Investigate secretly to find loopholes

166
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,587
Why

167
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,523
Why is it so dangerous?

168
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,457
He hasn't come out yet

169
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:32,858
Mr. Yan

170
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,294
I have an idea

171
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:36,829
Will it

172
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,830
He's not in there anymore

173
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,533
Could it be said

174
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,369
He is actually among this group of people

175
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,338
from now on

176
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,307
Keep an eye on me

177
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,508
These people in the school

178
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:53,979
yes

179
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,328
Before your father

180
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,130
Is a senior engineer at Micro Technology

181
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,698
These two companies

182
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,599
The connection is so tight

183
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't you think that between

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,968
Will it be a bit

185
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,078
So powerful

186
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,880
Not bad

187
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,014
Okay Okay

188
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,416
This will take some effort.

189
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,028
I'll give it a try first for Nan Xiaoqin.

190
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,129
wait a moment

191
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,098
I can't read

192
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,533
I'll try it for Nan Xiaoqin

193
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,467
Are you comfortable?

194
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,802
Specify discomfort

195
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,570
Only Nan Xiaoqin is comfortable when sitting

196
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,539
Coming, coming, coming

197
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,907
Give way, give way

198
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:34,880
Xiaoqin

199
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:37,783
look

200
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,884
I made it specially for you

201
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:39,618
This way you

202
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,786
Convenient to stand up and sit down

203
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:41,887
And look at this

204
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,655
I installed it specially for you

205
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,122
your crutch

206
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,923
Just right to get stuck here

207
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,892
Come and try

208
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,427
I think your brain is stuck

209
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:53,899
Really

210
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,668
Not saying yes

211
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,802
Is it okay to pretend that the years are quiet?

212
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:57,803
When acting

213
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,838
You can't even act with me for a while

214
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,044
What are you doing?

215
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:05,845
It's all gone

216
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,563
It was a gift from Yang Bawan

217
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,600
what is this

218
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,937
What's your situation?

219
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,157
Doudou Hello

220
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:40,926
If it can be so

221
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:41,660
words to call you

222
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,496
Thank you for saving me in the game

223
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,198
would prefer to

224
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:46,999
can in reality

225
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,167
continue to be partners

226
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:49,735
can take us

227
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,836
Trust in the game

228
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,770
brought to reality

229
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,240
For me who was once frivolous and naive

230
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,208
feel ashamed

231
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,811
So I don't have the courage

232
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,245
Say these words to you face to face

233
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:02,614
Nan Xiaoqin

234
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,616
i want to be friends with you

235
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,886
if you also want

236
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,254
Not as good as later

237
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,589
Share it here

238
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,291
Our secrets and thoughts

239
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:13,926
This way

240
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,561
Even if you scold me

241
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,129
No one else will hear you

242
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,932
After all, I am an internet celebrity

243
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,968
Why are you so old-fashioned?

244
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,203
Also use a diary

245
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,590
Don't you think

246
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,924
in game

247
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:46,658
We have long been

248
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,060
Teammates who have been through life and death

249
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,062
Are they friends?

250
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,466
Everything is fine recently

251
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,801
This is Yang Bawan

252
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,136
It's always a big deal

253
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,981
happy birthday to you

254
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,252
happy birthday to you

255
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,990
happy birthday to you

256
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:30,262
happy birthday to you

257
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,175
May 17

258
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,143
My birthday

259
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,446
happy birthday to you

260
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,880
My daughter gave this to me

261
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,249
first birthday gift

262
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,219
So everything here from now on

263
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,288
will only be about Chunyu

264
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:01,526
happy birthday to you

265
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,228
dad

266
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,563
happy birthday to you

267
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,897
All your secrets from now on

268
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,798
Write it all here

269
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,899
no one knows

270
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,639
Thank you

271
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,406
really mine

272
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,241
good daughter

273
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,410
Thank you, wife

274
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,078
What are you thanking for? Blow out the candles.

275
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:20,779
one

276
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:21,947
two

277
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,814
three

278
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,129
May 18

279
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:38,664
today

280
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,866
Daughter from the old cupboard

281
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,334
found a toy

282
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,969
It's Huarong Road

283
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,637
Dad what is this

284
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,440
I just finished explaining the rules to her

285
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,008
She was less than twenty seconds

286
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,376
The game is complete

287
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,645
Clear and efficient steps

288
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,448
I'm surprised by her talent

289
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,450
Didn't expect my daughter

290
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,451
is a genius

291
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,386
I must train her to be

292
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,621
best people

293
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,626
April 2

294
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,360
today

295
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,429
Let's go on an outing together as a family

296
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,564
Chunyu insists on playing hide and seek

297
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,400
As a result, I fell down

298
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,336
I was so worried

299
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,419
May 5th

300
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,620
today

301
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,290
Playing with building blocks with my daughter again

302
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,225
She encountered some setbacks

303
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,762
I almost stopped playing in the middle

304
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,564
child

305
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,166
You must be patient when doing things

306
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,001
Don't be discouraged

307
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,205
This is what I want to tell Chunyu

308
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,507
Maybe she already understands

309
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,243
Maybe I don’t understand that yet

310
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,645
but it doesn't matter

311
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,347
It's still a long time

312
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,383
Dad will stay with you

313
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,817
grow up together

314
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:08,887
fraud

315
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,206
April 19

316
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,808
Jiangning

317
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,177
This place full of memories

318
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,378
hope to be

319
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,613
The continuation point of our dreams

320
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,816
If time could go back

321
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,784
i hope myself

322
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,419
Never made that decision

323
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:42,888
why is this happening

324
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,623
can you give me another chance

325
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,658
I really want to go back to this day

326
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,463
Can I do it again?

327
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,799
I want to redo this day

328
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,333
I really can't go back

329
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,327
Let me see

330
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,161
You are just sick

331
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:23,895
Why do you want to follow?

332
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,930
Let's get together a lame couple.

333
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,732
Yang Bawan beat someone

334
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,667
tell me again

335
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,468
What did I say?

336
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,802
Quickly record him. Quickly shoot him. Quickly record him.

337
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,904
Say you don’t understand Nan Xiaoqin

338
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:35,240
Go, go, go

339
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,241
Stop taking pictures. Stop taking pictures.

340
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,380
What do you know

341
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,455
If it is Doudou

342
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,256
you will still have

343
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,290
Taking care of her thoughts?

344
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,561
Are you still watching?

345
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:57,629
Let's go

346
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,202
Yang Bawan

347
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,037
Know Nan Xiaoqin

348
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,305
Why are you angry?

349
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,508
Because you and Doudou

350
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,909
Think of it as two people

351
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,211
when did you

352
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,579
Able to use normal eyesight

353
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,547
Treat Nan Xiaoqin

354
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:16,548
When will you

355
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,449
Go after her again

356
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,323
I am, I am really messed up

357
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,259
What did she tell you?

358
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,362
Then you don't have to worry about this.

359
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,064
Consider me a generous act of kindness

360
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:33,965
Let me teach you

361
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,068
Take your things and let's go

362
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,349
In fact, this is the programming language

363
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,083
a technical feature

364
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:52,984
And it will be safer

365
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,786
Okay, thank you, senior

366
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:55,520
You are welcome

367
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:56,588
Goodbye, senior

368
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,055
goodbye

369
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:57,889
Goodbye teacher

370
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:58,723
Good bye

371
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,986
I found someone following us

372
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:43,902
you said so

373
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:44,970
I seem to feel it too

374
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,104
Someone is watching me secretly

375
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,684
Anyway, let's be careful

376
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:00,518
behave normally

377
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:01,686
Don't act rashly

378
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:05,890
OK

379
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,258
receive

380
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,326
OK

381
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:30,448
Coming

382
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,053
Hello, senior

383
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,621
Nian Sulan

384
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,689
Why are you here?

385
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:38,657
you forgot

386
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,557
The dean asked you to help me take a look

387
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,325
Graduation thesis

388
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,528
It seems like this is happening

389
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:44,829
That

390
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,898
Can we go in and talk?

391
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,601
that

392
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:52,904
I asked many people

393
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,972
I just asked about this place

394
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,973
It’s really hard to find

395
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,261
Looking for Gao Xuan, right?

396
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,897
He didn't tell me you were coming either

397
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:27,599
Stop standing there

398
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,333
Come on in

399
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,539
He is in the bathroom

400
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,374
His stomach and intestines are not feeling well lately

401
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:37,709
I gave it to him without looking

402
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,877
Did you buy some nutritional supplements specifically?

403
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,251
Are you honey or green tea?

404
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,419
What?

405
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,487
I bought them all

406
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,455
sugar content of honey

407
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,690
Causes excessive gastric acid secretion

408
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:53,958
Increase the burden on the stomach

409
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,126
What about theophylline?

410
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,294
Can irritate gastric mucosa

411
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,896
Causes stomach pain and bloating

412
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,030
Acid reflux and other phenomena

413
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:01,733
Really?

414
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,637
Chunyu, why are you here?

415
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,339
I came at a bad time, right?

416
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:09,707
Of course not

417
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,508
The senior is giving me guidance

418
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,342
graduation thesis

419
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,978
Otherwise, senior

420
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,647
You tell me about Chunyu first

421
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,214
Finished

422
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,182
Let's talk later

423
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,920
Let's change places

424
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,092
come in

425
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:31,863
Come

426
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,066
Right

427
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,134
Just now we

428
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:36,768
Really talking about the paper

429
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,468
I know

430
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,143
This is

431
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,978
In Chun Yiming's notebook

432
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,579
discovered

433
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,614
Are there any people from that machine?

434
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,482
no one is following me

435
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,384
The content here

436
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,653
Have password

437
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,890
Then at this time

438
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,258
It shows my importance

439
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,450
eight digit password

440
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,185
Decoding may take some time

441
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,090
Senior

442
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:25,677
what's inside

443
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,279
Not untied

444
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,348
Then I'll try another software.

445
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,249
No

446
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:34,986
that

447
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:36,821
Nian Sulan

448
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,256
She is Nian Yongcheng’s daughter

449
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,058
I really have nothing to do with her

450
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,696
What else do you have

451
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,763
Do you want to tell me?

452
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,900
Actually these days

453
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,134
i have been thinking about

454
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,536
If Uncle Chun

455
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,904
Something to do with this game

456
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,372
can you

457
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,573
Give him a call directly

458
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,307
Or send a WeChat

459
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:56,941
Ask him No

460
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,509
so long

461
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,310
I didn't contact him

462
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,745
I won’t contact him in the future either

463
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,046
Auntie's things

464
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:06,718
spring rain

465
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,020
Actually there are some things

466
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,254
it can't be erased

467
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:11,889
For example, blood relationship

468
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:13,891
but something

469
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,926
It can be erased

470
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,127
For example, in the past

471
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,761
some things

472
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,062
it just can't get through

473
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:23,868
spring rain

474
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:28,339
spring rain

475
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:28,940
Senior

476
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,045
What happened to her

477
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,646
Is it because of me?

478
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,016
Why don't you explain it to her?

479
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,817
It's okay, no need

480
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,453
Then let’s continue talking about the paper.

481
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,723
Let’s talk about the thesis another day.

482
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:47,925
OK

483
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,563
Senior, you look so tired

484
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,665
Pay attention to your health and get more rest

485
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:55,967
Let’s meet up another day

486
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:56,901
Nian Sulan

487
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,704
It’s not convenient at home either

488
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,406
If you talk about thesis again

489
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,240
Come find me in the office

490
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,207
OK

491
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,641
Hello Chunyu

492
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,209
memory card

493
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,343
Do you want me to try again?

494
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:41,846
No

495
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,653
some things

496
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,322
It does take time to resolve

497
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,357
I shouldn't have said that

498
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:54,625
It's OK

499
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,327
That's it

500
00:34:58,796 --> 00:34:59,430
that

501
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,899
If the password is eight digits

502
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,000
Digitally possible

503
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,068
Contains year, month and day

504
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,294
April 19

505
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:31,929
Birthday

506
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:33,197
right

507
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,265
Birthday

508
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,540
Children are not important

509
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,141
me to you

510
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,509
It's even less important, right?
