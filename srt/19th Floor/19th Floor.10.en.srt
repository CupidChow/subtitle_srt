1
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
What are your thoughts on this?

2
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,280
It's a bit cruel to say this

3
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,680
Your legs may not recover

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
Same as before

5
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,840
If you haven't

6
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,080
If you think about it carefully

7
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,880
Or we

8
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,720
no problem with me

9
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,520
good

10
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,280
Nan Xiaoqin

11
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,880
Why are you here?

12
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
I'm here to buy something

13
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
But didn't buy it

14
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,280
I help you

15
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,960
Need not

16
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,520
Do it faster

17
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,560
What are you doing so quickly?

18
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
No rush to reincarnate

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,960
What's wrong with you?

20
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
It's okay to waste other people's time

21
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,440
not me

22
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,200
Stop talking

23
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Are you okay?

24
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you just now

25
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
You said this

26
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,920
Between brothers

27
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,120
It's normal to help each other

28
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,160
Right

29
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
what are you doing here

30
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,200
That was a game company just now

31
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,360
They launched a

32
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,840
A game called Nineteenth Floor

33
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,720
Let me tell you, the effect is super realistic

34
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,560
Particularly shocking

35
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,400
particularly exciting

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
Do you usually play games?

37
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
That fun of playing games

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
You may not feel it

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,040
Anyway

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,640
I passed

41
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,520
their qualification test

42
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
They invited me over today

43
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Sign an experience agreement

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,600
Then you signed

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,280
I'll ask them about it

46
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,640
News about Doudou in the game

47
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,320
I told them

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,480
if they don't tell me

49
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
I won't sign

50
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,040
He they told you

51
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,920
no

52
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,080
Then you didn't sign

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,600
No

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,200
I signed

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,560
Why

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
I think so

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,880
They didn't tell me who she was

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,840
probably because

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,120
She has quit the game

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,840
She doesn't play anymore

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,680
But I vaguely feel

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
She will definitely continue

63
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
of this game

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
she is so special

65
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,520
a girl

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
so brave

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,760
So powerful

68
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,320
She's still in the game

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,080
Saved my life

70
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,040
so what

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
I'm really looking forward to it in the game

72
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,480
meet her again

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
Although the chance is slim

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,360
but

75
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,800
I don't want to give up either

76
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Why are you so stupid?

77
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,360
Hello

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,480
I'm from our school

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,040
substitute teacher

80
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,680
My name is Gao Xuan

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,320
Teacher Gao

82
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
You want to borrow a book, right?

83
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,360
no

84
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,240
That's right

85
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,600
Yesterday I had a student

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Just came here to surf the Internet

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,640
The textbook is here

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,760
I was wondering if I could help

89
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Check our monitoring

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,120
See if it’s other students

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,720
Taken away

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,880
OK

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
What time is that?

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
It should have been last night

95
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,960
around eight o'clock

96
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
Okay. Stop for a moment.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Thank you for your hard work. Go a little further.

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,560
good

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay, right here

100
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,640
Mimi

101
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,800
I didn't expect that either

102
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,280
Things will get so serious

103
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
She's going to be punished

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,200
why are you doing this

105
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
I don't know what you are talking about

106
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
Senior

107
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,600
The video was sent by you

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,000
no not me

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,240
first post

110
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
It was 8:01 last night

111
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
Sent from the campus network

112
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,880
The Internet Protocol address is also easy to check.

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Just in the school library

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,520
The third reading room

115
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Then I watched the surveillance

116
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,360
that time

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,040
In the third reading room

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,280
only you

119
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,760
you know

120
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,880
Do you know what it was like back then?

121
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,640
in game

122
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,120
She was

123
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
That's what she wears

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,840
I have no idea

125
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
What is that clothes called?

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,000
Anyway, it just looks good.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,400
younger sister

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Boys dormitory in your school

129
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,400
Where is it?

130
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Just go ahead and go straight.

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,400
Xiaoqin, please go back to me first

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
Brother, I'm looking for you

133
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,040
It's so hard. Oh my god.

134
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,600
no

135
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,120
Big brother

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,680
What are you doing

137
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,800
They all found the school

138
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,480
Weird and scary

139
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,120
I can't help it either

140
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,680
that brother

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,160
Jianghu emergency

142
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,560
You have to help me once

143
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,760
What can I help you with?

144
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
Lend me some money

145
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,960
not much

146
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,160
Just twenty thousand

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
I, I can't help it

148
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,040
I have to help Ayong

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,920
Pay medical bills

150
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,240
Brother Qiang

151
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,200
It’s not that I won’t help you

152
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,280
I am a poor student

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
Where did I get 20,000 yuan?

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,720
Here you go

155
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,320
That's right too

156
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:46,840
Otherwise

157
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,200
You go back and talk to your dad.

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,520
Ask him to pay back the money

159
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
I still get a commission anyway.

160
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't even think about it

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,040
My dad is a money slave

162
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,760
Otherwise you

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,280
take me to your house

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
Find the passbook

165
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,680
You speak, you

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,760
Brother Qiang

167
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,320
I think otherwise

168
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
Or go by yourself

169
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,600
spring rain

170
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,320
What a coincidence

171
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm asking you for a favor

172
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,960
Start to open

173
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:23,920
you

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Could you please be reasonable?

175
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Still a college student

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,040
Brother Qiang Brother Qiang

177
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,640
Brother Qiang

178
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,040
She might be in a bad mood

179
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,240
No 80,000

180
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,040
you help me

181
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,600
No, you help A Yong

182
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,560
he is my best brother

183
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
What happened to Ayong?

184
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
Ah Yong is in the intensive care unit

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,040
That’s why you didn’t transfer him to another hospital

186
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,520
I want to transfer it to him

187
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,880
But his attending doctor

188
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Substituted

189
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,120
Said that the previous training was over

190
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,240
Too late

191
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
As a result, he

192
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,960
Still seriously ill

193
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
His attending physician

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Is your surname Jia?

195
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,440
Dr. Jia

196
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,720
You should have seen it too

197
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,680
I posted it

198
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,480
But I just put the facts

199
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Just sent it out

200
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
She left the cat alone

201
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
she left

202
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
Like she ignores me

203
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,200
Let one need her explanation

204
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,240
The weak one who depends on her

205
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,920
waiting to die alone

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,800
Quiet

207
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,480
actually want

208
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,520
truly understand someone

209
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,480
is difficult

210
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,560
many times

211
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,080
Even if you see it with your own eyes

212
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Not necessarily true

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,120
what do you mean

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,200
Go somewhere with me

215
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,360
You'll know when you go there

216
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,560
Hello

217
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,120
Hello

218
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm delivering something by courier

219
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,920
Then I want to ask

220
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,600
your community

221
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
There is a man named Mr. Jia

222
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,080
Specific house number

223
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,880
did you know

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,080
You have to call and ask yourself

225
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,480
I I hit

226
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,480
He doesn't answer

227
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,880
We don't care about this

228
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,720
Say it again

229
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,000
Our community is so big

230
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,400
Who knows which Mr. Jia it is?

231
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,440
Look

232
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,000
My delivery here is going to be timed out.

233
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,200
It’s time to deduct my money if it’s overtime

234
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,640
This has his name

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,680
Jia Haoran

236
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,080
Jia Haoran

237
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,480
Doctor Jia, what do you mean?

238
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,120
Right, right, right

239
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
He moved away this morning

240
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,920
Moved away

241
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,120
Where did you move to?

242
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,480
I don't know that

243
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
Just ask the shipper.

244
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,000
grandma

245
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,720
It's raining

246
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,640
A classmate of yours came to our house

247
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,880
She just

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,840
Just sitting on the sofa

249
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
she gave me something

250
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,880
Said he wanted me to sign

251
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,160
my classmate

252
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,480
yes

253
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,840
It's your classmate

254
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
Light rain

255
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,920
you won't be at school

256
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,120
What happened?

257
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I'm fine, grandma

258
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm going to find you now

259
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
you drink water

260
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,600
grandma

261
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,640
Tianqiang

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,200
you are here

263
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,120
Sit in the house quickly

264
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,080
I'll give you some tea

265
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,680
grandma

266
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
I'll come over

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,080
Come and help A Yong get something.

268
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,000
what

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,080
give me something

270
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,200
I'll help Ayong get something

271
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,640
good

272
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,840
Go into the house and look for it yourself

273
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,800
Okay, okay, go find it

274
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,480
Please slow down

275
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
good good good

276
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,280
good

277
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,120
go ahead

278
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,440
Tianqiang

279
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,040
I poured hot water

280
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
put on the table

281
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,200
When it's cold, drink by yourself when you're thirsty

282
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
Okay, I'll drink it later, grandma

283
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,480
you said this

284
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,440
Do you really need to be punished?

285
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,080
yes

286
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,040
Think about it, grandma

287
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,640
as a college student

288
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
The most basic sense of love and morality

289
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
There should still be

290
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,520
Chunyu does this

291
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,680
Really defective

292
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,760
no no no

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,640
will not

294
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,120
I know the children I raised

295
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,040
Our family Xiaoyu

296
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,840
Wouldn't do such a thing

297
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,000
She just has a cold face and a warm heart

298
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,760
You must be mistaken

299
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,080
It's not that I made a mistake

300
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,680
Everyone else recorded the video

301
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,720
Grandma, don’t be too anxious

302
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
You sign this petition

303
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,680
Let's take it and ask the school together

304
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,920
maybe so

305
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,600
They can be punished lightly

306
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,000
Xiaoyu, are you back?

307
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,560
It's okay, grandma

308
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Something big happened

309
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,720
It scared me to death

310
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,560
Senior sister

311
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,080
go out for a while

312
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
If you have anything, just talk here.

313
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,040
Grandma happened to be there too

314
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,800
please go out

315
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,880
It's okay, grandma

316
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,600
spring rain

317
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,240
You don't know yet

318
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,840
this matter

319
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,960
How serious is it to you?

320
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Maybe because of this incident, the school

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,920
punish you

322
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,960
As a senior

323
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,840
I saw you were punished

324
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I really can't bear it

325
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,400
After all, he is the president of the student union.

326
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,800
I'll make my own decision

327
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,680
Organized several classmates

328
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
Signed the petition

329
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,040
I hope the school can deal with it leniently

330
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,920
school girl

331
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,120
You won't mind

332
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,360
Do you mind?

333
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,480
First of all

334
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,920
Have I done it?

335
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,120
I know it in my heart

336
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,720
I don’t need anyone else to plead for me

337
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,120
Secondly

338
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
You do it with great fanfare

339
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,640
do these things

340
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Just to expand the influence

341
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,640
No need to be pretentious

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,720
finally

343
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm warning you again

344
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
no matter who you are

345
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Whether it is now or in the future

346
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
I will never allow it

347
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,080
You disturb my family again

348
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,560
Do you understand?

349
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
This Hei Er and A Yong

350
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
Haven't been home for several days

351
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
No phone number

352
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,000
grandma

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,320
Just the past few days

354
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,520
I didn't call you

355
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,600
What

356
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,120
I said

357
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,880
Hei Er didn't call you

358
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,640
No, you said

359
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Really

360
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,720
It shouldn't be

361
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,440
Heaven is strong

362
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,560
You, Hei Er and A Yong

363
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,480
you three

364
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,680
grew up together

365
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,160
Now we work together again

366
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,080
been together all these years

367
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,600
this is a good thing

368
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,120
But you

369
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,200
It's time to calm down

370
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,360
Look next door

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,760
That Dapeng

372
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,880
He's only twenty-four years old

373
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,560
That

374
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,480
The child was hugged

375
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,600
I don't know either

376
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,400
Can it still be done?

377
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,880
Take a fancy to your children

378
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,640
This

379
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,520
Sure, grandma

380
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,080
do not worry

381
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm here, I'm keeping an eye on those two boys

382
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,040
Not just the two of them

383
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
And you

384
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
I have to work harder, too.

385
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,920
come on

386
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,360
A red envelope for the three of you to get married

387
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,600
Grandma keeps them all

388
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,960
Wait until Hei Er and A Yong get married

389
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,920
I can also be regarded as the father of his child.

390
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
There is an explanation

391
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,040
grandma

392
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,160
I didn't find it

393
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I'll go in and look for a while

394
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,000
good

395
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,680
go ahead

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,800
go

397
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,920
go

398
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,320
It's the one

399
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,200
Two

400
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,440
How can I help?

401
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,560
Hello

402
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,240
I want to ask you something

403
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,160
do you know this girl

404
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,440
is her

405
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,600
She was the one who brought this cat

406
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,560
Sent for treatment

407
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,120
Are you sure it's really her?

408
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,120
Can't be wrong

409
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,200
I was the one who received it that day

410
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
She is so recognizable

411
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,480
It must be her

412
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,680
Store manager, come over here.

413
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,320
good

414
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Just take a look first

415
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
I’ll talk to you later

416
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,200
Thank you

417
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,080
It turns out that spring rain has never happened

418
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,920
left it behind

419
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,760
roll

420
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,320
We were outside at that time

421
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,040
It's really dangerous

422
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,000
Maybe Chunyu thinks you are in a coffin

423
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,960
Maybe safer

424
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,480
Chunyu and other girls

425
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,720
Maybe not the same

426
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,840
Her arrogance and stubbornness

427
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,640
Make it difficult for others to truly walk in

428
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,480
her heart

429
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,440
But I want to quiet you

430
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,600
may be an exception

431
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,600
you must be her

432
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
people who really care

433
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
We will experience it in this life

434
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,560
many different stages

435
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
at every stage

436
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,640
We will all encounter some

437
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,440
new friends

438
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,640
even without you

439
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,160
without me

440
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,520
We will still encounter spring rains in the future

441
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,400
new friends

442
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,200
But this does not mean

443
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,400
you will start from

444
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,120
disappeared from her life experience

445
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,160
For Chunyu

446
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,880
No matter how it develops in the future

447
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,840
someone she really cares about

448
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,480
Will always be in her heart

449
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,440
It turns out that spring rain has never happened

450
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,400
abandoned me

451
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I knew it obviously

452
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,080
Chunyu is such a person

453
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,720
She silently did so much for me

454
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
But never told me

455
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
But why should I misunderstand her?

456
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
And hurt her

457
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,080
Quiet

458
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,000
It's not too late now

459
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,360
Wenya, you are so cute

460
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
always support you

461
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,440
The baby is dying of thirst

462
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,440
we love you

463
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,440
we love you forever

464
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,160
Thank you for your support and encouragement

465
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,120
Xiaoya will continue to work hard

466
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,400
Where have all the people in the dormitory gone?

467
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,160
them

468
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,640
Of course I went to class

469
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,440
Are the roommates friendly?

470
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,000
Easy to get along with

471
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,240
Mainly because I'm easy to get along with

472
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,080
so

473
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,400
Only one week since school started

474
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,040
Just with them

475
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
became good friends

476
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,240
You're back. Thank you very much.

477
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
Don't let me show off

478
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,000
Then you have taken care of your hygiene this week.

479
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,160
Take advantage of the situation

480
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,080
Then I tell the truth

481
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,800
make a deal

482
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,360
That's weird

483
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,000
Little weirdos

484
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,120
What about today?

485
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,400
I don’t want to affect everyone’s rest

486
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
So I will download it first

487
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,320
Bye, love you

488
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,440
What's going on

489
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,960
You can bribe it

490
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,080
Some people are invulnerable

491
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,160
I don't want to give it to myself

492
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,880
Looking for trouble

493
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,000
There are quite a lot of people watching today

494
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,800
I heard that the Student Affairs Office is looking for you

495
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,560
Are you okay?

496
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
How can it be okay?

497
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,960
Today I

498
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,320
I even signed a petition for Chunyu.

499
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,800
spring rain

500
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
This matter

501
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,520
You really have to thank me, senior sister

502
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,520
if i did

503
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,480
You are like this

504
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Will the school punish me?

505
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,760
Has anything changed?

506
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,040
if i didn't do it

507
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,280
your behavior

508
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
It will only make the rumors worse

509
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,160
Why are you like this?

510
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,640
I'm helping you

511
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,240
Big devil tortures cats

512
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
real video

513
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,400
This is just

514
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,960
The Big Devil’s Cat Abuse Incident

515
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,160
the kitten inside

516
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
it has now been obtained

517
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,880
Very good treatment

518
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,200
and recovered well

519
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,040
Hello store manager

520
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,200
I want to ask you something

521
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,960
do you know this girl

522
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,840
i remember her

523
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
That day she was particularly anxious

524
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,200
Rush in with this kitten in your arms

525
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:54,880
kitten

526
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,360
She picked it up on the road

527
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
We rescued kittens

528
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
She also paid for medical expenses

529
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,560
It seems like this

530
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
She really was wronged

531
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
Things on the Internet are true and false

532
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,120
However

533
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,880
I listen to this

534
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,280
Record video person’s voice

535
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,440
somewhat familiar

536
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,920
like

537
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,240
Gao Xuan Gao Xuechang

538
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,640
Does it look like? Does it look like?

539
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,800
unlike

540
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,920
It turns out she wasn't the one who hit her

541
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,160
so

542
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,400
You really were wronged

543
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,920
Isn't this right?

544
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,800
All the evidence about this person is here.

545
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,640
You are blind

546
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,600
I'm just asking what's wrong?

547
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,280
I just want to know about the victims.

548
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,840
true inner thoughts

549
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,640
Why are you always targeting me?

550
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,160
Don't say that

551
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,960
I'm really not targeting you

552
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,720
You, you haven’t targeted me yet

553
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,600
No matter what I say or do

554
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
You all have to complain about me

555
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,600
How much do you despise me in your heart?

556
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,720
Got it right this time

557
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,160
I do

558
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,840
I despise you

559
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,360
But I'm really not targeting you

560
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,240
Nan Xiaoqin, are you going too far?

561
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,440
Remember to do some hygiene this week

562
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,600
Why?

563
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,880
I didn’t live broadcast

564
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,120
meet

565
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,520
good

566
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,920
Let's go for a walk

567
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,240
good

568
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,360
so you are saying

569
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,680
Dr. Jia suddenly disappeared

570
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,000
The security guard said

571
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,360
He moved this morning

572
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,720
The hospital said he resigned

573
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,520
Suddenly there was no news about him

574
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,960
That's really weird

575
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,200
Let's check

576
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,160
He disappeared

577
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,000
This itself speaks for itself

578
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,560
so i said

579
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
our inspection report

580
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,560
He must have tampered with it

581
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Maybe in our body

582
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,320
There really is a chip

583
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,840
Otherwise there is no way to explain

584
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,880
able to enter out of thin air

585
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,760
game world

586
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,720
Right

587
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
I've always wanted to ask you

588
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,520
do you think we

589
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,480
people who play games together

590
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Is there anything suspicious?

591
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Tranquility and Eighty Thousand Simple

592
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,000
Brother Qiang looks quite fierce

593
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,560
But in fact

594
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,160
Brainless

595
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,240
And Hei Er and A Yong

596
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,280
when something goes wrong

597
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,840
He doesn't look like he's pretending

598
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,360
Although Uncle Lin sometimes seems

599
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,200
A little timid

600
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,760
but to others

601
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,520
They're all sincere

602
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,800
He can also exclude

603
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,680
Doudou

604
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,400
Although she doesn't want to

605
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,960
reveal her identity to us

606
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
But she didn't treat us either

607
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,760
do something outrageous

608
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,360
You analyzed everyone

609
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,520
except me

610
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,840
So do you still doubt me?

611
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,520
thank you

612
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,920
I know

613
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,360
That clarification video

614
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,160
you did it

615
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,520
clarification video

616
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,400
nothing

617
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,680
a trivial matter

618
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,040
classmates

619
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,240
Lights out soon

620
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,640
If you want to fall in love, come back tomorrow

621
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,080
Not ours

622
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,840
let's go

623
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm sorry

624
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,840
Sorry

625
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,920
yes or no not important

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Time makes people grow old

627
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,920
That

628
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
I went up

629
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,680
See you soon

630
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,600
Right

631
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,760
What you just asked me

632
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,080
Likewise

633
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,080
I want to ask you

634
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,320
Didn't you ever doubt me?

635
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,720
If you have any questions

636
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,960
in game

637
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,040
I don't know I have to log off

638
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,760
How many times

639
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,560
See you soon

640
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,960
good

641
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,440
from that moment on

642
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,000
I no longer have any doubts

643
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,200
It will help you laugh in the future

644
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,320
Thirty mutton kebabs

645
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,280
Another dozen beers

646
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,320
okay

647
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,920
A little faster

648
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,480
good

649
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,080
Hurry up

650
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,200
Come on, come on, have a drink

651
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,160

652
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,080

653
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,600
drink one

654
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
Come and do it

655
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,880

Then I will

658
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,120
drank

659
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,800
I can't drink anymore

660
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,720
Can't drink anymore

661
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,160
What about fish farming?

662
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,040
How much do I drink? How much do you drink?

663
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,400
Come, come, come

664
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,280
Let's play games again

665
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,120
This is fifteen or twenty

666
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,720
Can't beat you

667
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,160
I'll come

668
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,080
Can Bamaoqi play?

669
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,840
Come, come, come

670
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,320
Come

671
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,320
Come come

672
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,680
Come, come, come

673
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,320
Maomao Maomao seven five

674
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,840

675
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,240
black hole

676
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,920
drank

677
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,440
Hope to see Doudou again

678
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,000
Hope to see Doudou again

679
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,920
People who died in the game

680
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,160
will fall into coma

681
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,200
don't be surprised

682
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
With current brain-computer interface technology

683
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,520
If a chip is implanted in the body

684
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
anything can happen

685
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,760
spring rain

686
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
sorry

687
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Game triggered

688
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,080

690
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,080
