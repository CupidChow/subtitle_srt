1
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,160
Among these leather figurines

2
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,640
Copying leather figurines is the best

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,880
We cooperate with Chunyu

4
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,160
lead them away

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,200
then

6
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Defeat each one

7
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
I leave this to you

8
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,000
brother

9
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm really sorry

10
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
Although we are very similar

11
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,080
But now this

12
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,920
Different positions

13
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,800
Take action

14
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
There are two this time

15
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,680
It's more difficult

16
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,960
It's OK

17
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,080
Outnumbered six to two

18
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,400
We still have a numerical advantage

19
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,320
look

20
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,840
Still the two weakest

21
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,800
Get up

22
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,520
this thing

23
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,520
Obviously the weakest one

24
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,360
Why are you so fierce?

25
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,640
Everyone

26
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
It's time for us to go

27
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,680
Lao Gao

28
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Shall we take a break?

29
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,840
Let's go again

30
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,720
I really have no strength at all.

31
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,720
When we were having trouble just now

32
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,400
There's too much movement

33
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
It’s really too late if you don’t leave now

34
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,440
careful

35
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,440
It's over. It's over now.

36
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
what to do what to do now

37
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
What else can I do? Let’s fight.

38
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,880
what to do

39
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,520
spring rain

40
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,880
Walk

41
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
spring rain

42
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,760
spring rain

43
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,600
spring rain

44
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,760
wake up quickly

45
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,480
spring rain

46
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Spring Rain, wake up quickly

47
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,480
The evil spirit has been removed

48
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
Game cleared

49
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,920
A Yong

50
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,200
A Yong

51
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
Eighty thousand Eighty thousand

52
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,640
Class begins

53
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,160
don't call me

54
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
I played games all night

55
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,920
sleepy, ok, ok, ok

56
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,880
I don't care about you anymore

57
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,480
spring spring rain

58
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,080
why do you

59
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Locked me in

60
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,680
Quiet

61
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,680
look

62
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
Your weakness and forbearance

63
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
Didn't make your predicament

64
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,280
get any resolution

65
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
Do you want to continue to be this cowardly?

66
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,200
Do you still want to be dependent on others?

67
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,480
come on

68
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,080
Become stronger with me

69
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Overcome your weaknesses

70
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,400
defeat yourself

71
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
let me out

72
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,040
Is there anyone?

73
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
let me out

74
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,000
spring rain

75
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
spring rain

76
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,480
I knew you must

77
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,240
won't leave me

78
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,640
you will definitely come

79
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
Since I didn't abandon you

80
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
why do you betray me

81
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,920
I didn’t

82
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,480
We two are best friends

83
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,800
How could I betray you?

84
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,640
I didn’t

85
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
best friend

86
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,720
Best friend you let me die

87
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,600
I didn’t

88
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,520
I didn’t

89
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,400
I don’t have Chunyu

90
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
I didn’t

91
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Why are you so nervous so early in the morning?

92
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,640
What the hell are you doing?

93
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes Sorry

94
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,840
Originally right away

95
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,160
It's about to be painted

96
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,120
Really

97
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,880
are you having a nightmare

98
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,320
Not sleeping well recently

99
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,840
I beg you

100
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
If you really can’t sleep well

101
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,840
I'll treat you to some sleeping pills

102
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,480
Ok

103
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,480
real

104
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,520
You won't die if you eat a few less slices

105
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,760
Save yourself the trouble of harming others

106
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,240
What do people like to eat and not eat?

107
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,400
Do you care?

108
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
Besides, you don’t have nightmares?

109
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,080
Those first few days of school

110
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,160
Who screams the loudest?

111
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,120
Did I take care of you?

112
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,280
please

113
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,000
i am a victim

114
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,560
Why is it still my fault?

115
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
you are indeed a victim

116
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,800
Yes I'm sorry

117
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,920
You two, stop arguing.

118
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,880
it's all my fault

119
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
It's okay

120
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
The group exploded early in the morning

121
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,280
Looks like there's a big melon again

122
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,760
Quiet

123
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,600
Come and take a look

124
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,560
How does she treat cats

125
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,320
Just treat her how you want

126
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
unbelievable

127
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Too cold-blooded

128
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,720
anger

129
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
The cat is so pitiful

130
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,360
How could there be such a person?

131
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,560
Such people will be punished sooner or later

132
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
Is it lacking in virtue?

133
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Oh my god

134
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,680
She should be arrested

135
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,360
So cold-blooded

136
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,120
Now she dares to kill the cat

137
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
I dare to kill people from now on

138
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
Not worthy of being called

139
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,520
Social bug

140
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,720
The kitten did nothing wrong

141
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,320
Right, right, right

142
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,000
What I said before is right

143
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,840
She is not afraid of retribution either

144
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,360
This might be fake

145
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,200
How could it be fake

146
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,200
On the day I registered, someone told me

147
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,320
She is ruthless and advocates violence

148
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,560
that person

149
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,680
It's her high school classmate

150
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,560
By the way, he also said

151
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,720
She likes to carry weapons

152
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
Do you remember

153
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Just on the first day

154
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,440
Inside her schoolbag

155
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
There's a hammer

156
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,480
why at night

157
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
I always have trouble sleeping and have nightmares

158
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,040
I'm just afraid of her at night

159
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
give me a hammer

160
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,960
No, no, no

161
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,360
I want to change dormitories

162
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,120
Then hurry up

163
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,560
It’s more spacious with one less person

164
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,960
No, you

165
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,120
You're targeting me again

166
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,160
OK

167
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,680
Too lazy to pay attention to you

168
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
I share it with my fan base

169
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
What are you doing? This is my phone

170
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,480
you give it to me

171
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
Withdraw your message

172
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,640
This

173
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,160
Is it real

174
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Give it back to you

175
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,200
Who are they?

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,120
Just bully me

177
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,720
A Yong

178
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,360
Okay, you boy

179
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,000
Now you won't even answer me when I call you

180
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,640
Eat banana?

181
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,120
your favorite banana

182
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,360
OK

183
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,080
I have become more capable

184
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,640
This banana is really good

185
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
I really don’t want to take a bite.

186
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,040
Ah Yong

187
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,240
Why aren't you awake yet?

188
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,400
Will you ever be able to wake up?

189
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,560
Congratulations on being in the Nineteenth Floor Game

190
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,960
Survival time exceeds twenty hours

191
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,480
Tianji Technology

192
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,120
You are sincerely invited to participate

193
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,520
Nineteenth Floor Trial Signing Conference

194
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,600
Aunt

195
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,360
I want this

196
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,520
steamed stuffed bun

197
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,800
Okay, two more eggs

198
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,880
Aunt

199
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,640
The uncle next to you

200
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,360
Why didn't you come?

201
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
You mean Lao Lin?

202
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,120
He didn't make breakfast today

203
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,240
OK, thank you, auntie

204
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,360
You eat so little

205
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
What does it have to do with you?

206
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Are you growing taller?

207
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,200
You should eat more

208
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,800
If you don't eat it, you'll get that serious disease.

209
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,480
You are seriously ill

210
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,120
What's your name?

211
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,480
My name is Doudou

212
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,920
Just say it

213
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,200
lovesick

214
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Which girl do you like?

215
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
Do you want me to help you?

216
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,440
you can't say

217
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,080
You can't say

218
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,080
Tell me

219
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,880
what's it called

220
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,520
Called Doudou

221
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,160
What's your name?

222
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,920
Doudou

223
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,040
You really know me

224
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,160
Don't know

225
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll just say it

226
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,080
It's impossible for you to know

227
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,120
Because

228
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,320
she is me

229
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,120
met in dream

230
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,880
Nan Xiaoqin

231
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,400
you say

232
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,720
The same eyes

233
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,160
Why do everyone look so good?

234
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,800
So sexy and charming

235
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,360
watery

236
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,240
You look so ordinary

237
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,000
It's dry

238
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,520
You are the dry one

239
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,680
I see your dull eyes

240
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,480
face dull

241
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Dry skin appearance

242
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,320
Determined to die young

243
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,280
You said you are this person

244
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm kidding

245
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,920
Why are you angry?

246
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,520
Hello

247
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,000
Mom, you're here

248
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm in the cafeteria

249
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,440
go away

250
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,960
What the hell?

251
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,600
My own daughter won’t help either

252
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,880
Going to be late

253
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,440
You go first

254
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
I have a little diarrhea

255
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,560
Be careful

256
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,040
Sorry

257
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
How shameless

258
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,560
He did such an immoral thing

259
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
Still so arrogant

260
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,800
What's wrong, Yaoyao?

261
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,000
she is the one

262
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,240
The cold-blooded devil who tortures cats

263
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,840
Freshmen majoring in geriatric health care

264
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,280
spring rain

265
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,960
Didn't you see that video?

266
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
It’s become popular on the campus network

267
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,320
Didn't watch it

268
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,360
spring rain

269
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,800
What a coincidence

270
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,960
I thought

271
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,280
Will you continue to follow Dr. Jia?

272
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,280
Just a pen

273
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,640
It's hard to prove that he and Tianji

274
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,800
Is it related to the 19th floor?

275
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,640
do you believe

276
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,760
He has nothing to do with Tianji

277
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Of course not

278
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,920
It's just us now

279
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,120
no conclusive evidence

280
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,040
Yesterday's actions were a bit abrupt.

281
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,800
I want to find evidence later

282
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,560
I'm afraid it's difficult

283
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,120
A Yong

284
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,000
He should still be at Guangming Hospital

285
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,720
That Dr. Jia is there

286
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,960
Ayong is still in danger

287
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,360
It's best to transfer him to another hospital

288
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
OK, I'll arrange it

289
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,240
Talking and laughing

290
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,720
It seems that this matter

291
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,720
It doesn't affect her at all

292
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,720
Who?

293
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,240
It's me Gao Xuan

294
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,360
How is Ayong doing now?

295
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,560
Not awake

296
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
I even doubt A Yong.

297
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Will you wake up?

298
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,720
So many days have passed

299
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,040
normal alcoholism

300
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,920
You should wake up too

301
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,400
Yes

302
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
I seriously doubt this hospital

303
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
Is it because of poor medical skills?

304
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,720
Such A Qiang

305
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,040
It just so happens that I'm at another hotel

306
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,240
There is an acquaintance in a very good hospital

307
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,560
Let me contact you

308
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,080
Turn Ayong over and take a look

309
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,480
How is it

310
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,280
Okay, okay, okay

311
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,240
fine

312
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,400
But you have to remember

313
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,320
Don't say it

314
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,320
Bad words about Guangming Hospital

315
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,160
Don't argue with them

316
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,000
Don't say it either

317
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,240
That their medical skills are not good or something like that

318
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,400
To avoid extraneous problems

319
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:23,880
OK

320
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
Me I won’t argue with them

321
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,120
Don't argue with them

322
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,680
I still have some emotional intelligence.

323
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,240
good

324
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,720
A Yong

325
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,560
in a few days

326
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,920
Let's go to the next hospital and try it out

327
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
you will get better

328
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,640
Hold on for two more days

329
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,040
Maybe the inspection by this company is not accurate

330
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:04,880
next time we

331
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,680
Let's find another hospital

332
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,720
Xiaoqin

333
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
We have changed

334
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,320
Four hospitals

335
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,240
It's a bit cruel to say this

336
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,560
but it's true

337
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,880
Your leg

338
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
May not be restored

339
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,960
Same as before

340
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,160
No way, Mom

341
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,400
I will definitely get better

342
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,920
I want to go back to the fencing ring

343
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
You will guide me then

344
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,640
I still want to win the championship

345
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,040
Say it again

346
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,360
Is there a new guy on the team?

347
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,560
Get in the car quickly

348
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,240
I still have to rush back to the team for training

349
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,880
It's OK

350
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,920
If something happens to you

351
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,800
Just go and get busy first

352
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,960
I can just take a taxi and go by myself.

353
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm talking to you

354
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,280
I want to be transferred to the hospital

355
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,120
Why not?

356
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,240
I've already explained it to you

357
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,960
many times

358
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,680
Transfers require the signature of immediate family members

359
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,400
Only then can

360
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,840
My brother has an old lady in his family

361
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,800
I'll give you the old lady

362
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,240
Come back and sign this in person

363
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,880
OK

364
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,880
your hospital

365
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Why can't it be flexible?

366
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,000
This is the hospital policy

367
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,960
Moreover, the patient

368
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,240
No sign of waking up now

369
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,120
Hastily transferred to another hospital

370
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,280
Will have an impact on the condition

371
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,320
rashly rashly

372
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
I have been staying in your hospital

373
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
This is called rashness

374
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,280
Doctor Jia, right?

375
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
He is my brother's doctor

376
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,360
You call him over and I'll talk to him.

377
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:40,960
Dr. Jia

378
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,200
He came to our hospital for further study.

379
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,440
The training is over and I have left.

380
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I don’t care if you are a real doctor or a fake doctor

381
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,800
OK, I don't care

382
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,360
I will definitely do it today

383
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,200
I need to get my brother out of the hospital

384
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,360
Then I'll talk to the doctor

385
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,320
Explain the situation

386
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,760
Okay, go a little faster

387
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,800
By the way sir

388
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,080
Before transfer

389
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
Please complete this hospitalization bill.

390
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,960
Your deposited fees

391
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,680
Not enough anymore

392
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,520
so much money

393
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,240
boss

394
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,200
They have become alert

395
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
Zhang Tianqiang wants to transfer to another hospital

396
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,040
I've already made arrangements

397
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,160
clear

398
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Mr. Yan

399
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,960
There's something I never understand

400
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,400
Since they

401
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Already in the game

402
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,480
Why do you still need to sign a contract?

403
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,240
This world does not use laws

404
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,480
As a rule?

405
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,800
I especially like to follow the rules

406
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,200
Be a good law-abiding citizen

407
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,520
Senior

408
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,120
Class is over

409
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,880
right

410
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,240
Will there be classes soon?

411
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,080
Just two sessions this morning

412
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,040
spring rain

413
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,880
Where are you going?

414
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,840
Student Affairs Office

415
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,640
Student Affairs Office

416
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,680
By the way, Nian Sulan

417
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
You are often in the student office

418
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,440
Do you know what happened to Chunyu?

419
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,800
I do not know

420
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,800
Senior

421
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
What did you say her name was?

422
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,520
spring rain

423
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,440
They posted a video today

424
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,640
The girl’s name in that

425
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
It’s called Chunyu

426
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,800
What video?

427
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,480
I'll look for it

428
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,520
No. 188, Tianhe East Road

429
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,440

435
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,280

437
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840

A player named Doudou

439
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
Are you coming to your signing meeting?

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560

Hello

450
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,200

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,880
Mr. Yang

457
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,800
Let me introduce you first

458
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
Let’s try out the contents of the agreement

459
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,480
OK

460
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,680

very deep understanding

464
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,280
Based on your presence in our game

465
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,880
Survive for more than twenty hours

466
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,880

467
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160

468
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,320
So just survive

469
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,480
more than twenty hours

470
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,280
You can become a contract experience officer

471
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,800
Yes

472
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,400
Just become a contract experience officer

473
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,560
Not only are there gifts to take

474
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,960
There will be bonuses after passing the level

475
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,400
you feel

476
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,280
That all exceeds

477
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,240
twenty hours player

478
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,040
Will you all get in touch?

479
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,400
Yes

480
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,240
Then do you recognize it?

481
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,200
A player named Doudou

482
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,920
who is she

483
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,000
Is she from our school?

484
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,600
Feel sorry

485
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
we cannot disclose

486
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Player information

487
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,040
No

488
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,080
That

489
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
you gotta tell me

490
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Is she coming today?

491
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,480
That her

492
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
We are teammates in the game

493
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,000
Didn't you contact her?

494
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,640
I am so sorry

495
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:24,840
Mr. Yang

496
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,840
If there are no other questions

497
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
Please on this agreement

498
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,680
Sign it

499
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,520
Actually

500
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,280
There is still a little problem

501
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,720
please speak

502
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,360
Just can you tell me

503
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,560
What is Doudou’s real name?

504
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,640
You don't need to tell me too much

505
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,800
I can find her by myself

506
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,080
I didn’t say it was you who said it

507
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,680
OK

508
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,360
Excuse me

509
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,960
out of need for confidentiality

510
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,920
Any personal information of the player

511
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,200
We can't reveal

512
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,280
I'm really sorry

513
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I won’t sign if you don’t tell me

514
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,400
nurse lady

515
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,600
that

516
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,200
hospitalization expenses

517
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,160
Do I have to pay before I can be discharged from the hospital?

518
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,200
Of course

519
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,160
hospital regulations

520
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,120
Please help me

521
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,080
can you give it to us

522
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,800
Be a little more accommodating

523
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,920
Rules are rules

524
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,960
Must be transferred before transfer

525
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,800
Pay hospital bills

526
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,280
You see you are so young

527
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,920
so beautiful

528
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
This guy is so good

529
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,680
Can you help me?

530
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,920
Thirteen bed patient signs

531
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,600
suddenly abnormal

532
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,280
call the doctor quickly

533
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,960
how many beds

534
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,840
Thirteen

535
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,280
First aid for patient in bed 13

536
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,760
A Yong

537
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,640
A Yong

538
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,400
A Yong

539
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,080
A Yong

540
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,280
A Yong

541
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,280
let me see my brother

542
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,200
You wait outside

543
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
You can't come in. Come on.

544
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,200
Excuse me

545
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,360
Doctor, hurry, hurry, hurry

546
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,040
Look at my brother

547
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,960
You wait outside

548
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,800
Wait outside

549
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,960
Prepare for defibrillation

550
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,600
doctor doctor

551
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,200
doctor doctor

552
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
How is my brother doing?

553
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,760
The patient's current physical condition is stable

554
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
But further observation is needed

555
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,000
later

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,920
He was sent to the intensive care unit.

557
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,720
Why are you still in the intensive care unit?

558
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
You don’t need to be too nervous

559
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
If the patient's signs

560
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,320
If it can remain stable

561
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,520
Will be redirected soon

562
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,440
Went to the general ward

563
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,840
If you still have any questions

564
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Come to my office and chat

565
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,200
You told me before

566
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,800
My brother is just an alcoholic.

567
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
How about alcohol poisoning?

568
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,640
Still not healed yet

569
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,520
Even admitted to the intensive care unit

570
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,120
Previous alcoholism

571
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,960
Let the patient's respiratory circulation center

572
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,880
affected

573
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,480
Now it's affected again

574
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,040
brain nerve cell membrane

575
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,960
The situation is not optimistic

576
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,800
It's so serious

577
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,400
So what can we do now?

578
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,160
I suggest

579
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,400
The patient still has to be there

580
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,040
Observation in the intensive care unit for a few more days

581
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,360
I heard

582
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,320
Do you want to transfer the patient?

583
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,400
What happened just now

584
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,280
you have seen

585
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,360
The patient's condition is not stable

586
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,000
Not guaranteed

587
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,880
He was in the process of being transferred to another hospital

588
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,640
No surprises

589
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,000
Okay, then me

590
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,720
knew

591
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,080
thank you doctor

592
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,920
Wait a moment

593
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,440
I heard that the patient's hospitalization fee

594
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,400
Not knotted yet

595
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,720
Don't forget to tie the knot

596
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,360
and

597
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,920
intensive care unit costs

598
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,680
There will be more than ordinary wards

599
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,920
You must be mentally prepared

600
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,640
OK

601
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,400
Look

602
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,440
What is said on the Internet?

603
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,040
Cold-blooded devil

604
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,480
Catwoman Yaksha

605
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,240
Cruel Post-Zero

606
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,640
I remind you

607
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,440
spring rain

608
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,800
If found out

609
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,080
this thing is true

610
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,360
You will be punished

611
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,160
Then go check it out, teacher

612
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Just such a person

613
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,440
Still in college

614
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,400
I don’t know about class either

615
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,240
What are they taught?

616
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,240
It's disgusting to look at

617
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,120
This is just a college student

618
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,120
Strongly requesting the school to punish her

619
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,840
expulsion

620
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,240
Too cruel

621
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,280
children nowadays

622
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
Who would dare to marry such a person in the future?

623
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,960
The cat is so pitiful

624
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,360
I heard

625
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,320
This girl has been

626
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,760
This woman is my high school classmate

627
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,560
in high school

628
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,480
People give him the nickname Big Devil

629
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,400
I heard that I often bully my classmates.

630
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,760
You don’t have to love me, please don’t hurt me

631
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,520
So sinful

632
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,280
Must be severely punished
