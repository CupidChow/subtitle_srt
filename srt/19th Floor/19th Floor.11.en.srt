1
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,200
spring rain

2
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
spring rain

3
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
sorry

4
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,000
don't be afraid

5
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,000
you

6
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Do you want to save Chunyu?

7
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
If you want to save her

8
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,680
You must listen to me

9
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,720
The time has come

10
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,160
The sacrifice begins

11
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,640
Quiet

12
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Quiet

13
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,840
very simple

14
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,480
Clear customs

15
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
Only need to solve one person

16
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,240
don't be afraid

17
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,440
Don’t you want to save Chunyu?

18
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,920
You can think about it carefully

19
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,680
Who should I choose?

20
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,960
No

21
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
I didn't promise you to kill someone

22
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,920
You have no other choice

23
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,000
No

24
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
only this

25
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
Only then can you pass the level

26
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
only this

27
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,320
Only you can save her

28
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,480
very good

29
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,160
very good

30
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,680
you know

31
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
if you don't

32
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,200
What will happen to the spring rain?

33
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,160
only this

34
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,440
Only then can Chunyu be saved

35
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,760
Only then can Chunyu be saved

36
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,160
go ahead

37
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,000
you what do you want to do

38
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,400
Quiet

39
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,080
what are you doing

40
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,320
Are you trying to stab me?

41
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,480
Quiet

42
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Don't mess around

43
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Classmate Qingyou

44
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
No matter how annoying that strong guy is

45
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
You can't stab him with a knife either.

46
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
Let's talk carefully if we have something to say

47
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,280
little girl

48
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
Put down the knife quickly

49
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,240
Yes

50
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,200
They are all right

51
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,040
You listen to them

52
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,280
put the knife down

53
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
Be obedient and put down the knife

54
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,920
spring rain

55
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Do you still remember that picture?

56
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
There are also tasks for this level

57
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
Complete the Deserted Village Festival

58
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
Tasks in this level

59
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,280
Get rid of evil spirits

60
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
Complete the Deserted Village Festival

61
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,040
sacrifice

62
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,880
The sacrifice is

63
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
Let's not be in a hurry

64
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
think carefully

65
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
OK OK

66
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,160
you want to poke

67
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,400
You'd better stab me to death

68
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,200
You can't stab me to death

69
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
I'll come out and I'll kill you

70
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,280
I'll kill you even if I'm a ghost

71
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,840
I become a leather figurine

72
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm going to bite you to death

73
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,080
I'll bite you to death

74
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,680
OK

75
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,480
If I tell you not to poke me, you won’t.

76
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
That's all you have

77
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,160
Come on

78
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,120
Come on

79
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,520
Come on, come on and stab me

80
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
Come and stab me

81
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
I didn’t

82
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,120
You will only hold others back

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
cowardly

84
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
Timid

85
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,240
incompetent

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,640
You almost killed Chunyu every time

87
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,040
but this time

88
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
you can save her

89
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,520
this is your only chance

90
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
kill him

91
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
Get away from me

92
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,480
No

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,000
think carefully

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,800
think carefully

95
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,360
think carefully

96
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,560
Think about it

97
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,680
Think about it

98
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,000
think about them before

99
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,280
how did it treat you

100
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,000
You are so pitiful

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,520
You are so pitiful

102
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
You are so wronged

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,840
It turns out she really has that something

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
claustrophobia

105
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,760
Strange

106
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,080
No wonder I don’t have any friends

107
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
You acted it, right?

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,960
Why is she so timid?

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
you you know

110
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm afraid of the dark

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,640
Can you not let me in?

112
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
spring rain

113
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,520
Are you willing to be the weak one?

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
Shut up

115
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,880
Come on

116
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,880
Stab me

117
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,920
Come on

118
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,000
Isn’t it very shameless?

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
That's all

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,640
Come on

121
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,520
Quiet

122
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,880
you can't do this

123
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,520
You, you are not such a person

124
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,360
What happened to Qingyou?

125
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,840
Her eyes are very strange

126
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,560
no

127
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,440
Sister Qingyou

128
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,320
You adults don't remember the faults of villains

129
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,720
elder sister

130
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,200
I just

131
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,960
Was I kidding just now?

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,600
You, don't stab me

133
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,080
little girl

134
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
Wake up quickly. Wake up.

135
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,560
wake her up quickly

136
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,960
She has lost her mind

137
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,760
She can't wake up

138
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,080
What should I do if she can't wake up?

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
Then one of us has to die.

140
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
I don't want to die

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,760
I don't want to die

142
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
I don't want to die

143
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,920
Quiet

144
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
this is you

145
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,680
You are such a person

146
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,880
you are always with me

147
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Behind someone else's butt

148
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,160
what others say

149
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
what did you say

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Chunyu, what are you doing?

151
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,920
Don't make any noise

152
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,480
what others do

153
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,080
Just do whatever you want

154
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,200
You have never had a self

155
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm not

156
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
no you are

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,360
You are the weakest

158
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,160
And you are a

159
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
the most selfish person

160
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,920
you will always need

161
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Only with the protection of others

162
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,280
Quiet

163
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,080
Don't say anything when you go outside

164
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm your good friend

165
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,240
because you know

166
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,160
What do you need?

167
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,800
what you really need

168
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,760
is a strong man

169
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,440
can protect you

170
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
And I happen to be the strong one

171
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,160
You are the most selfish person

172
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
You are the most selfish person

173
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm not

174
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,280
Who are you

175
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm not that kind of person

176
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,920
You are a selfish person

177
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm not I'm not I'm not

178
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,800
you are you are

179
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,600
Quiet

180
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
this is not you

181
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
wake up soon

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,080
who are you

183
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,960
Sorry

184
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,080
I just

185
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,600
Nothing I just said is true

186
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
in my memory

187
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,280
Qingyou is a

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,040
Someone who looks a bit like me

189
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,360
always alone

190
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,360
a little lonely

191
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,400
but she is very

192
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,280
Gentle

193
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
very kind

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,360
Quiet

195
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,560
do you know

196
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,120
I

197
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,080
I

198
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,720
I always

199
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,040
Everybody regards you as

200
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,400
my best friend

201
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,760
spring rain

202
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,480
spring rain

203
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,280
sorry

204
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,760
sorry

205
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,160
not me

206
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,400
That was not me just now

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,520
It's okay

208
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,640
It's okay It's okay

209
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,200
Quiet

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,560
This is all

211
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,920
I chose

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,320
Do not blame you

213
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,960
spring rain

214
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,320
why are you doing this

215
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,920
This way

216
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,000
We can get through it

217
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,320
spring rain

218
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,920
Quiet

219
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,440
Quiet

220
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,320
Thank you

221
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,160
Let's go

222
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
spring rain

223
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,320
Am I strong this time?

224
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,040
Sorry

225
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,520
all the time

226
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,080
It's all me hiding behind you

227
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
this time

228
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,000
Finally I'm protecting you

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,640
Thank you

230
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,680
thank you all

231
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,440
I've caused trouble to everyone.

232
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,720
spring rain

233
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,360
Congratulations to all players

234
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
Pass the Deserted Village Festival

235
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,440
Qingyou is not a weak person

236
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,800
she is all of us

237
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,760
the strongest partner

238
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,720
Quiet

239
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,680
Quiet

240
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Quiet

241
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,800
Qingyou, wake up, Qingyou

242
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,760
Quiet

243
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,680
Quiet

244
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,120
Qingyou, wake up quickly Qingyou

245
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,160
Quiet

246
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,920
Hello

247
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,800
This is Ganghwa Academy

248
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,600
Girls dormitory building

249
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,240
someone fainted

250
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,080
Come quickly

251
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,680
Quiet

252
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,640
Quiet

253
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,360
Doudou

254
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,320
In short

255
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,400
Thank you

256
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Help her collect some things

257
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,440
good

258
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,680
careful

259
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,600
so she comatose

260
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
It's because of that game

261
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,560
Don't go

262
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,440
Give it to me

263
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,000
in addition

264
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,280
Can you please not tell others?

265
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,920
I am Doudou

266
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm leaving. Who's following?

267
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,920
I follow

268
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,520
OK go

269
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:08,920
superior

270
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,680
Every sacrifice is immortal

271
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,520
No matter how weak the firefly is, it will still shine

272
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,080
The dark shadow hiding behind the fireflies

273
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,160
will eventually appear

274
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,920
Hello

275
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Get Qingyou’s medical records

276
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,160
OK thank you

277
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,120
There is something foreign

278
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,600
Obvious foreign body seen in brainstem

279
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,200
Why is there a foreign object?

280
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,920
Has she had any recent surgeries?

281
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,560
no

282
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
This foreign object in her brain

283
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,800
Most likely a piece of metal

284
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,960
metal sheet

285
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,840
Yes

286
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
According to the appearance of this foreign body

287
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,360
Judging by size

288
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,920
Metal sheets are most likely

289
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,320
Dr. Jia

290
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Sure enough, it was a cover up for Tianji.

291
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
our reality

292
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,200
If the metal piece is a chip

293
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,920
Now we can basically conclude that

294
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,280
This is to control us

295
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,520
Entry into the game

296
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,440
That

297
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,480
Will it be fine if I take it off?

298
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,920
If picked

299
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,360
Qingyou can’t wake up either

300
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,640
But if you don’t dismantle it

301
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,720
Quiet or comatose

302
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,200
no better than now

303
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,160
Worse situation

304
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,600
The doctor also said just now

305
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,600
Surgery is very risky

306
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
In case there is anything wrong with it

307
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
Anyway, she is in a coma now

308
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,520
Then take out the chip

309
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,760
Maybe she still has a chance

310
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,240
spring rain

311
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,400
what do you think

312
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,200
I just want to save Qingyou

313
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,720
Which one

314
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,160
If you want her to die

315
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,760
Although the chip is removed

316
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,640
what did you say

317
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
About the chip

318
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,120
Your judgment is correct

319
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't be nervous

320
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,280
I just want to tell you

321
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,920
Unauthorized removal of chips

322
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,960
is very dangerous

323
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,120
To know

324
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,480
The brain is a very fragile thing

325
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,440
Aren't you afraid

326
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,440
permanent damage to the brain

327
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,680
Never wake up again

328
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
But as long as you obey

329
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,520
I can guarantee that you will wake up peacefully

330
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,240
who are you

331
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,400
quiet consciousness

332
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,000
Still stuck in the game

333
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,640
Remove it for her now

334
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,440
Will only lead to brain death

335
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,920
Don't scare people, you

336
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,520
Of course

337
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,040
It’s not like there’s no solution

338
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,080
As long as you keep playing

339
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,000
and pass the level

340
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,800
Including Qingyou

341
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,240
Everyone's consciousness before

342
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,120
All can be restored

343
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,520
but

344
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
If any of you drop out

345
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,880
Or prepare to get into trouble with the hospital

346
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,280
As long as I press it lightly

347
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,680
Everyone will be in a coma forever

348
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,080
Why should we believe you?

349
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,960
You may not believe it

350
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,600
The choice is yours

351
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,840
What guarantee do you have?

352
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,720
As long as we pass the customs

353
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,680
You will wake up if you are quiet

354
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,160
Believe it or not

355
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,640
It's all your freedom

356
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,320
Hey Hey

357
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,040
This is too scary

358
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,760
I don’t want to play this game anymore

359
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,920
I want to quit

360
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
how do you exit

361
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,680
Do you believe that liar?

362
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,480
What did you say?

363
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,840
I can't gamble with everyone's lives

364
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,120
Even if we want to quit the game

365
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,560
According to what he just said

366
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,160
Once we're in a regular hospital

367
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560
If the chip is removed

368
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,600
may be dangerous

369
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,040
we may lose our memory

370
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
or intellectually impaired

371
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,760
What if he lied?

372
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,520
spring rain

373
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
I'm not saying I don't want to take care of Qingyou

374
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,720
I mean

375
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,720
can we

376
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,400
Think of some other ways

377
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,080
for example

378
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,800
For example, let's change

379
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,760
Try a larger hospital

380
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,120
I have another way

381
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,520
I'll contact you first

382
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,560
Brain-computer interface expert

383
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,280
Don’t rush to remove the chip first

384
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,960
if he gets angry

385
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,480
If you attack Qingyou immediately

386
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,480
we lost

387
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,000
The only chance to save her

388
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,040
That

389
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,920
That person just said

390
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,760
Must have everyone

391
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,640
Complete the game together

392
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,560
What about Doudou?

393
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,160
we even

394
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,800
Don't even know who she is

395
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,480
will she attend

396
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,480
she

397
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,040
She'll keep playing

398
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Otherwise everyone

399
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,640
Think about it first

400
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,160
Let’s talk later

401
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,000
no matter what

402
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,840
I must save Qingyou

403
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,280
Not Chunyu

404
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,000
I didn't mean that

405
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
I didn't say I don't care about Qingyou

406
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,640
Quiet

407
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,560
Quiet

408
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,680
Quiet

409
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,760
Quiet

410
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,400
Quiet

411
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,360
nurse

412
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,320
A little girl named Qingyou

413
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,800
in which

414
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,680
Right hand side turn left

415
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,240
Quiet

416
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,520
Aunt

417
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,600
spring rain

418
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,960
Director Liu told me

419
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,880
Qingyou in the hospital

420
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
how is she

421
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,320
Uncle Lin

422
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,280
Chunyu asked you to come

423
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,680
If I could confirm

424
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,400
Tianji Company’s statement is credible

425
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,600
are you willing to continue

426
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,560
this

427
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,880
I'm not quite sure yet

428
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm just thinking

429
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,120
With the safety of so many of us

430
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,960
Go and get another one

431
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,040
There is no chance of distinguishing between true and false

432
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,360
Is it worth it?

433
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,400
Uncle Lin

434
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Are you afraid?

435
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
You don't have to be afraid

436
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,720
But what about your family?

437
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,400
Where is my friend?

438
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,320
What about the people who care about you?

439
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,800
I'm older

440
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
Naturally, I think more

441
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,520
What you said

442
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,400
I understand everything

443
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,440
That's it

444
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Please think about it again

445
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,280
I will inform everyone

446
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,240
Three o'clock this afternoon

447
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,360
Gather in the cafeteria

448
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
You can tell me then

449
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,920
It's your decision

450
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,400
OK

451
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,840
Hey Brother Qiang

452
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,720
where are you

453
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm eating out

454
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,200
Brother Xuan, what's going on?

455
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,160
Hold on

456
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll go find you

457
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,960
wafer

458
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,800
in the brain

459
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,560
Then Ayongta

460
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,400
Now you know the situation clearly

461
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,960
I want to know what you think

462
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,680
Are you willing to come with us?

463
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,520
continue this game

464
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,080
I'm so willing

465
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,840
That's what you say

466
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,800
This game is so dangerous

467
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm stupid and I'm still going to play

468
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,120
I don't want my life

469
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,120
I know what you are worried about

470
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
We also got a message

471
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,760
Even if

472
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,040
Let's remove this chip

473
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,240
But the brain is still in danger

474
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,200
This is all your conjecture

475
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,240
Then you don't plan to

476
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
Do you care about Hei Er and A Yong?

477
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,000
have you ever thought about

478
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,120
If we can get through

479
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,920
If this game

480
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,920
We can save them

481
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,440
this is my business

482
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,120
I don't want you to worry about it

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,360
Brother Qiang

484
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,680
if you want

485
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,360
If you change your mind

486
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,600
3pm

487
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,760
See you in the school cafeteria

488
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,120
Qingyou is a timid child

489
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,080
claustrophobia

490
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,960
Make her very introverted

491
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
she doesn't have any friends

492
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,160
Until I get to know you

493
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,640
She slowly became braver

494
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,520
I don't understand your business

495
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
I knew it

496
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,880
You have always been her role model

497
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,040
Even going to college

498
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,200
I also want to go to the same school as you

499
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,400
I want to keep doing it with you

500
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
best friend

501
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,280
But

502
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,240
spring rain

503
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,280
I have been troubled for a long time

504
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,760
I don't know what to say to you

505
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,080
But I have to apologize to you

506
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,840
I'm really sorry

507
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,880
The cat video was posted by me

508
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,080
I know

509
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,880
whether you care or not

510
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,080
Rumors can cause you harm

511
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
It's all my fault

512
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,000
It’s all my fragility and sensitivity

513
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,200
That led to the current situation

514
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,080
I don't ask for your forgiveness

515
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,160
I just want to say to you

516
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Thank you Chunyu

517
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,000
It was you who taught me to be strong

518
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,960
The homework was not handed in

519
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,400
Stand behind me

520
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,720
spring rain

521
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,920
Sister, you are busy

522
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,080
busy

523
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,240
grandma

524
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,800
Grandma, I'm all with you

525
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,800
How many times have I said this?

526
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,240
Let's not collect these things

527
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,160
Don't take it. Don't take it.

528
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,120
Don't take it. Don't take it.

529
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,000
Don't accept it

530
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,400
Tell me if you have no money

531
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,200
Heaven is strong

532
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,760
Grandma is not short of money

533
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,880
Grandma can still do it now

534
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,840
Earn more

535
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,240
Right

536
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,480
You left that money last time, right?

537
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,480
I can't have it

538
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,200
grandma

539
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,280
That

540
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,560
The money last time was

541
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,160
Ayong asked me to give it to you

542
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,440
A Yong's money

543
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,760
Ah Yong

544
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,600
That

545
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,480
Then why doesn't he give it to me himself?

546
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,840
This guy

547
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,240
Haven't been home for several days

548
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,160
Hei Er is also like this.

549
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,360
you say

550
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,880
Him and them both

551
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,120
Busy at work

552
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,360
Gone on a business trip, grandma

553
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,200
On business trip

554
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,800
they they are good

555
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,320
It's okay

556
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,320
Don't worry, grandma

557
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
On a business trip

558
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Good for business trip

559
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,920
Then tell them

560
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,640
Ask them to be careful

561
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,280
Peace and peace

562
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,680
that's the best

563
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,320
Heaven is strong, so are you

564
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,800
Thank you for taking care of A Yong and Hei Er

565
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,400
Thank you

566
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,600
grandma

567
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,840
that grandma

568
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,600
I have something else to do, so I'll leave first

569
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,800
Better to be busy

570
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,720
Go ahead

571
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,560
Go to work

572
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,880
Don't worry grandma

573
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,000
Don't worry grandma

574
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,320
good boy

575
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,240
go ahead

576
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,080
grandma

577
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,560
do not worry

578
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,640
I will definitely get it together

579
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,600
A Yong’s medical expenses

580
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,800
Then put A Yong and Hei Er

581
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,120
Bring them all back safely

582
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,960
You and Brother Qiang and the others

583
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,840
How was the chat?

584
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,280
I informed everyone

585
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,160
Gather in the cafeteria

586
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,920
I believe that as long as I give it to everyone

587
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,840
some time

588
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,680
they will all make

589
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,600
the right choice

590
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,880
Anyway, no matter what

591
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,280
I must save Qingyou

592
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm just a little worried about Brother Qiang

593
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,080
After he listened

594
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,320
Rejected directly

595
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,720
But don't worry

596
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,680
we'll find a better way

597
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,360
No matter what they did

598
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,240
what kind of decision

599
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,760
I will always be with you

600
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let’s save Qingyou together

601
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,720
I don't want to force everyone

602
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,680
if you don't want

603
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,400
If you continue the game

604
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,160
I didn't force it

605
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,520
As long as you still want

606
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,400
continue this game

607
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,800
I won't leave

608
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,160
I

609
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,480
I think he will continue

610
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,760
Is it because of Hei Er and A Yong?

611
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,280
Eighty thousand

612
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,600
I want to pay 80,000

613
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,000
it's your turn

614
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,800
green

615
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,200
Twenty thousand

616
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,800
what to do

617
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,960
Do you need the money?

618
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,440
Are you ready to collect money?

619
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,400
Then put me and my brother together

620
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,360
That one is ready

621
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,080
and

622
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,120
I told you I won't fuck you anymore

623
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,400
50,000 each

624
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,440
I also played my cards

625
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,160
Peace

626
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,480
You are so awesome, Lao Yang

627
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
The man surnamed Yang paid back the money

628
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,480
No, this card

629
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,760
not you

630
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,040
You'll never finish this little money

631
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,400
right

632
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,600
this card

633
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,960
I lost more than I owe you

634
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,160
Then you should pay the money back.

635
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,120
Just because of your little money

636
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
My brother's life is in danger

637
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,360
I tell you

638
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,320
Even if you don’t pay it back today, you have to pay it back.

639
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,040
You have to pay it back

640
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,720
What a fart

641
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,800
Lao Yang Lao Yang

642
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,280
roll

643
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,840
The one just now doesn't count.

644
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,880
How is that possible?

645
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
How can it be counted if it is knocked off?

646
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,280
They all bullied me

647
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,320
I am also the eldest brother

648
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,400
I am also the eldest brother

649
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,240
I want to take a look this time

650
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,760
your friendship

651
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,880
How strong is it?
