1
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,168
This agreement is just a disclaimer

2
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,807
But I'm willing to negotiate with you

3
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,642
Didn't expect that

4
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,144
Can you still come here like this?

5
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,678
It's my first time to meet

6
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,046
This passive situation

7
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,349
You really impressed me

8
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,517
Tell me about it

9
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,485
What are your demands?

10
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,387
very simple

11
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,556
Let Qingyou and the others wake up

12
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,824
Let's quit the game

13
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,327
To be honest, I really don’t like being

14
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,162
threat

15
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,429
But that's it

16
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,697
It seems I don’t need to

17
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,965
Let you continue the game

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,404
You are really President Tianji

19
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,510
You may not believe it

20
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,846
The choice is yours

21
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,149
Why should we believe you?

22
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,486
You may not believe it

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,488
The choice is yours

24
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,127
Introduce yourself

25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,128
I am Yan Mingliang

26
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,163
Founder of Tianji Technology

27
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,232
Then why are you pretending to be an ordinary employee?

28
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,567
some things

29
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,869
I like to do it myself

30
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,237
and accustomed to

31
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,104
close range

32
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,839
Observe test subjects

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,907
experiment

34
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,742
Are you using us as guinea pigs?

35
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,545
every scientific experiment

36
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,346
all represent human beings

37
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,547
Pursue the progress of civilization

38
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,049
From this point of view

39
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,918
I prefer to call you

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,354
Pioneer

41
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,190
You've made everyone miserable

42
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,625
Half dead

43
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,759
What kind of progress is this?

44
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,828
Progress comes at a price

45
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,830
Those are real lives

46
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,564
I can't see

47
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,232
This is your experiment

48
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:52,899
What's the point

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,035
Don't you think

50
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,003
Games I created

51
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,905
Is it really wonderful?

52
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,407
Thrilling

53
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,109
Everyone can experience it

54
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,377
completely different life

55
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,947
Just enter my game

56
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,515
you can experience

57
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,984
magical new world

58
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,287
This is a timeless work

59
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,623
A game for the brave

60
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,058
this is

61
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,327
The new world I want to create

62
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:24,797
everyone is there

63
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,698
a starting line

64
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,966
Only brave enough

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,001
smart enough person

66
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,469
Only worthy of having more

67
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,838
What a fallacy

68
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,740
We're not here to argue with you

69
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,241
No one has the right

70
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,342
decide other people's fate

71
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,480
You don't see the point of the experiment

72
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,648
it's not surprising

73
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,149
not everyone

74
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,584
Everyone has the patience to wait for tomorrow

75
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,985
The truth is always in

76
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,086
in the hands of a few

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,421
OK

78
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:49,822
These poisonous chicken soups

79
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,057
Just be happy yourself

80
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,059
We just want to quit the game

81
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,527
Wake up a comatose friend

82
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:55,662
OK

83
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,631
Come and remove the chip in two days

84
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,400
At the same time I release their consciousness

85
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,648
I didn't expect it to be so easy

86
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,316
That's it

87
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,350
Yan Mingliang didn't expect it either

88
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,084
So scary

89
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,519
It seems that the agreement and the video

90
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,119
Still useful

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,020
Hello

92
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,657
Hello

93
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,460
I would like to ask

94
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,062
Are you still in the ghost building now?

95
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,029
Play as a non-player character?

96
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,164
ah

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,635
Not every time someone new comes in

98
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,569
You will all be in the ghost building

99
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,470
Play the game

100
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,005
Play as the first person killed?

101
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,809
That might be in

102
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,876
At the R&D center

103
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,045
I can't remember clearly

104
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,047
I was sick a few days ago and forgot a lot of things

105
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,282
What’s going on in the R&D center now?

106
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,183
I don't ask anymore

107
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,499
Very good

108
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,167
Finally freed

109
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,105
It feels so good to be free

110
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,140
I still think

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,141
A little too smooth

112
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,277
Lao Gao, you are good at everything

113
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,479
Just too careful

114
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,313
I have all the evidence in my hand

115
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:20,980
What are you afraid of?

116
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,283
This way

117
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,418
You two go back first

118
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,686
I still have something to do with Chunyu

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,487
good

120
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:28,988
But

121
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,390
What's going on with you two?

122
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,826
What does it have to do with you?

123
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,230
well

124
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,664
Then I'll leave first

125
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,432
You guys have a good chat

126
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,032
Come on

127
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,566
Bye-Bye

128
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,139
What happened?

129
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,508
You just heard me mention it

130
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,343
I went to MicroTech to sign a contract today

131
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,978
In the annual group photo

132
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,779
Saw Yan Mingliang

133
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:53,880
This shows that the two of them

134
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,781
The relationship is very unusual

135
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,116
In addition, research areas of micro-technology

136
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,117
It's computer science

137
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,318
and brain-computer interface technology

138
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,687
say so

139
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,755
These two companies

140
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,157
The business content is quite close

141
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:04,824
That's right

142
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,225
This shows that between them

143
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,160
have some kind of connection

144
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,562
in addition

145
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,497
Before your father

146
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,166
Is a senior engineer at Micro Technology

147
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,501
These two companies are so closely connected

148
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,803
Don't you think that between

149
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,804
Will it be a bit

150
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:19,939
Walk

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,907
Where are you going?

152
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,208
Chun Yiming dormitory

153
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,123
Mr. Yan

154
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,325
I will really give it to them when the time comes

155
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,126
Remove the chip?

156
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,262
Didn't you say

157
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,564
When upgrading the system

158
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,866
Found a new problem?

159
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,468
yes

160
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,937
Several of their players

161
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,006
data

162
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,679
in addition

163
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,082
It’s time for us to change our approach

164
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,118
There's no point in fighting and killing.

165
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,657
Unlocked

166
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,638
That's how you are

167
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,739
You got into Tianji, right?

168
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,553
This is microtechnology

169
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,121
The dormitory prepared for your father

170
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,960
spring rain

171
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,795
Has anyone been in this room?

172
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,099
Also a possibility

173
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,901
Just sloppy

174
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,004
What then?

175
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,639
Let's look for clues first

176
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,599
where are you

177
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,502
let's go

178
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,604
Nothing to be found here

179
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,505
Think of another way

180
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,040
Let's go

181
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,063
You when you were a child

182
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,831
Laughter than now

183
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:01,834
take it away

184
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,828
what

185
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,163
Live job search

186
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,599
Don't be so nervous

187
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,767
Nothing like you imagined

188
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,434
So formal

189
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,370
It’s for internship students in their junior year

190
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,704
an opportunity to express yourself

191
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,607
Senior sisters

192
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,743
You also know

193
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,913
How fierce is the competition for live streaming now?

194
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,983
This is a broadcast that no one else is interested in

195
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,818
Everyone has canceled it

196
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,990
We are all from the same school

197
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,325
You won't help me with such a small favor?

198
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,127
elegant

199
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:02,728
Since you first entered school

200
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,663
I was the one who picked you up

201
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,232
I've been treating you well since then

202
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,167
Just do your sister a favor

203
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,834
OK?

204
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,941
Otherwise, is this good?

205
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,178
You guys make something related to food?

206
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,546
I will cooperate fully

207
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,184
OK

208
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,386
Then let's think about it again

209
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:30,756
that

210
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,658
Senior sister

211
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,026
I'm going to air

212
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,761
Then I'll leave first

213
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,038
What are you doing?

214
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,407
You have a good temper

215
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,109
It was you who patted those breasts back then

216
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,644
Everyone is waiting

217
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,679
Think about it for a while

218
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,081
How can I explain it to everyone?

219
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,629
No, Nan Xiaoqin

220
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,330
Are you concerned?

221
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,164
I do nothing but eat

222
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,199
I have no other talents

223
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,266
It's you who I'm guarding against

224
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,868
A foodie with a short mouth

225
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:17,970
Come

226
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,071
Bought for you

227
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,006
poisonous

228
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,275
Come, come, come

229
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:24,643
Don't want it in vain

230
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,352
I have something to ask you for

231
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,327
I knew it was nothing good

232
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,998
What happened last time was all thanks to you

233
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,867
Only you can help me with this matter

234
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,401
It’s Doudou again

235
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,837
Nan Xiaoqin, what did I say?

236
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,539
You are my brain circuit

237
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,306
tell things

238
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:58,544
I told you last time

239
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,311
that game

240
00:12:59,545 --> 00:12:59,979
these two days

241
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:00,780
I won't play anymore

242
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,381
you find the game

243
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,315
Way to exit

244
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,350
you know

245
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,619
I I guessed

246
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,586
Didn't you just say

247
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,488
Am I your brain circuit?

248
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,157
And that game is so dangerous

249
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,525
It's a good thing you don't play anymore

250
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,561
That's what it says

251
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,595
But if I don’t play

252
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,563
What about that game?

253
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:17,997
so I

254
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,864
I can’t see Doudou anymore

255
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,838
But compared to whether I can see her or not

256
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:26,939
I'm more worried about

257
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,540
Does she know

258
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,641
The dangers of this game

259
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,476
I want to take her

260
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,544
Quit the game together

261
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,444
But I don't know

262
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,646
Who is she in real life?

263
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,616
Then find her in reality

264
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,517
You put it lightly

265
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,752
How can I find her in the huge crowd?

266
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,755
That game of yours

267
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,490
own image

268
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,225
Games and real life

269
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:46,926
Is the difference big?

270
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,996
Anyway, what am I like in reality?

271
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,231
That's what it's like in the game

272
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,899
So did Chunyu and Gao Xuan

273
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,202
Chunyu and Gao Xuan also play

274
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,337
Then I think Doudou is in all likelihood

275
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,538
Also from our school

276
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:02,808
Right, right, right

277
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,343
And Xu Wenya and Qingyou

278
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,244
Many of them are classmates

279
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,112
That's easy

280
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,381
I remember you told me last time

281
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,916
This Doudou has a good figure

282
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,784
Good physical strength

283
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,952
And he also knows martial arts

284
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,687
Then ordinary people can't

285
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
meet this standard

286
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,223
Then I guess it’s just school.

287
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,224
Female talents in the physical education department

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,961
where are you going

289
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:23,829
Nan Xiaoqin

290
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,897
You are not my brain circuit

291
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:25,965
you are my brain

292
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:26,432
Come

293
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,600
Come on, these are all yours

294
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,300
Eat slowly

295
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,220
classmates

296
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,121
Do you know Doudou?

297
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:49,889
nice shot

298
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:50,556
Doudou

299
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,757
Do you know Doudou?

300
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,594
Classmate, do you know Doudou?

301
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,161
Don't know me

302
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:56,996
Sorry

303
00:14:59,198 --> 00:14:59,698
Doudou

304
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,234
Do you know Doudou?

305
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,403
classmates

306
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:06,839
Doudou, classmate, you know

307
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,751
Then Xu Wenya won’t do it

308
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:19,718
Can you still blame me?

309
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:20,319
okay

310
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,220
I have something else to do, let’s talk about it later

311
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,759
sorry sorry

312
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,261
Sorry, I'm in a hurry

313
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:29,862
This

314
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,563
Falling so hard

315
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:33,666
never mind

316
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,834
It just so happens that I'm too lazy to answer the phone.

317
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,435
No, no

318
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,503
I I have to I have to compensate

319
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,470
that

320
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,105
Falling so hard

321
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,040
Probably

322
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,041
five hundred

323
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:46,645
eight hundred

324
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,383
give me a call

325
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:53,786
Call myself

326
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:54,720
See if the phone still works

327
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:55,988
I'm sorry

328
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,622
I am sorry

329
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,379
Brother, what are you doing again?

330
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,284
Isn’t this the big internet celebrity Xu Wenya?

331
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,864
Let’s meet and chat

332
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:13,665
good

333
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,674
What's up

334
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:25,978
nothing

335
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:36,922
See you for what?

336
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,157
I don't want to see you

337
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,304
you tried your best

338
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,406
Doudou will be very touched

339
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,977
Where is Nan Xiaoqin?

340
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,913
Don't laugh at me

341
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,950
She will definitely know

342
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:05,884
You believe me

343
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,061
I clearly know you are comforting me

344
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,663
But don't know why

345
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,065
I think what you said is true

346
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,111
mobile phone

347
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,950
It's my sister

348
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:40,819
elder sister

349
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,588
Send me the guitar music I just learned

350
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,690
Hope your legs get better soon

351
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,561
Baby, don't cry

352
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,997
Imagine stars twinkling

353
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,269
The distant light shines through the path

354
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,340
If you see warmth and brightness

355
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,242
Softness comes from it

356
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:08,647
You should be brave enough to look for it

357
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,554
A touch of sweetness blends with a touch of bitterness

358
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,522
Doudou

359
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:22,394
A period of waiting ushered in a series of footsteps

360
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,765
There are also tears in the smile that unfolds

361
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:34,706
Finished

362
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,713
You are Doudou

363
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,118
You are Doudou

364
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:47,986
Regret

365
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,621
no no no

366
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,389
Unexpectedly

367
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,623
Doudou is disabled, right?

368
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:52,424
you

369
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:53,625
You are Doudou

370
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,526
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,194
That

372
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,262
Chun Yu, they all know you are

373
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,764
You know about the chip?

374
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,798
Isn't this nonsense?

375
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,668
That, that, that

376
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,536
Will you remove the chip?

377
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,239
If I take it off

378
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,874
Where are you going to find your goddess?

379
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:09,908
no

380
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:10,876
no no

381
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,410
Doudou

382
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,244
Doudou me me me

383
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,045
I didn't mean that

384
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:13,445
At once

385
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,846
this this you you

386
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,681
disabled disabled

387
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,782
Disability is pretty good too

388
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:19,952
no no no

389
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,385
no no

390
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,887
Needless to say

391
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:22,788
I know

392
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,190
Doudou Doudou Doudou

393
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,425
You, slow down

394
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,059
No Doudou

395
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,527
Doudou, that’s not what I meant

396
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,194
Doudou

397
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,121
Coming

398
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,556
You have something to do with me?

399
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,125
I'm still thinking

400
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,060
Dismantling the chip

401
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,228
Yan Mingliang

402
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,363
It was a little too easy to agree

403
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,832
so you worry

404
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,799
Yan Mingliang has a conspiracy

405
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,200
yes

406
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,201
Also

407
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,569
Remove the chip

408
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,937
probably to our bodies

409
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:12,271
elegant

410
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,105
It's really not what you think

411
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,039
I did not mean it

412
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:14,873
Xu Wenya

413
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,308
Wenya, please listen to my explanation

414
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:16,808
elegant

415
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,744
Don't follow me anymore

416
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,381
Do you know how long I have been working hard?

417
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,882
It's all your fault

418
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,017
What's going on

419
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,785
I met a fanatical fan. This is

420
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:28,720
I probably know

421
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,588
What's going on?

422
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,367
sorry

423
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,169
I know you like to eat fruits

424
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,070
I just passed by the fruit shop

425
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,405
Who wants to eat these?

426
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,807
I don't like these

427
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,509
what i like

428
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,110
It's Cheerilee

429
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,046
It’s Musang King Durian

430
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,314
don't you know

431
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:56,648
I know

432
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,783
I will definitely buy it for you next time

433
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,317
I'll do it next time

434
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,685
No need for you to buy it for me

435
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,186
The trouble you caused me

436
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,487
Not enough?

437
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,523
Don't come to me again

438
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,509
without me

439
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,279
Can you live a better life?

440
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,154
her brother's status

441
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,222
doesn't look good

442
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,191
Let's follow up and see

443
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,225
good

444
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:46,998
Xu Wenwu

445
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,100
Do you think this company

446
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,034
Your family opened it

447
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,001
It was you back then

448
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,702
Please tell grandpa to sue grandma

449
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,470
Let me transfer it to you

450
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,337
Now I have to transfer him again

451
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,805
Walking around here

452
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,040
will give one

453
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,074
people who are important to me

454
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:56,608
Add to trouble

455
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,709
Don't follow me anymore

456
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,577
Don't let me see you again

457
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:58,877
roll

458
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,779
Don't come to me again

459
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,186
what are you doing

460
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,821
You calm down first

461
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:10,789
Not worth it

462
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:11,723
what

463
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:12,958
If you have anything, we can discuss it carefully

464
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,393
You come to me first

465
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,327
who are you

466
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,162
I don't know you

467
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:18,663
Come

468
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,605
let go

469
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,272
I won't let go

470
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,207
I don't want to die

471
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,475
I didn't want to jump off the building

472
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,047
Come

473
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:36,848
you

474
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,450
I just want to come up

475
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,818
Shout loudly to vent your anger

476
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,086
Who are you two?

477
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,745
Are you really okay?

478
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,148
What can happen?

479
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,617
Don’t we have to live our lives as usual?

480
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,153
you

481
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,555
Follow Wenya for me

482
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,389
Say sorry

483
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,024
No matter what

484
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,525
You two are also brother and sister

485
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,828
As long as she's good, I don't care

486
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,629
and

487
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,066
Someone has to protect her

488
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,034
Isn't it?

489
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:37,676
you say

490
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,378
I can't understand Xu Wenya

491
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,280
I really envy her

492
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,450
What do you envy her for?

493
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,085
I envy her for being an internet celebrity

494
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:49,788
right

495
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,326
that

496
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,660
Can't leave

497
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:56,995
Something just fell

498
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,796
I have to look for it

499
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,380
Where did it fall?

500
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,381
Just now with her brother

501
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,749
While pulling on the rooftop

502
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:18,383
fell down

503
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,584
It should be around here

504
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:21,586
You see

505
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,188
He also said he wanted to help others

506
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,189
Turned into a joke

507
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,157
thank you

508
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,392
Useless help

509
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,730
What is it?

510
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,165
Just a smiley face seal

511
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,000
wooden

512
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,542
Do you have any impression?

513
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:49,581
no

514
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,957
That was when I was a child

515
00:25:59,057 --> 00:25:59,991
Someone gave it to me

516
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,593
Also on the rooftop

517
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,598
Given to me when I was a kid

518
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,899
Have been carrying it for so long

519
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,835
After all, that experience

520
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,470
Very unforgettable indeed

521
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,943
Then look for it quickly

522
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,585
Forget it if you can't find it

523
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,519
Let's go first

524
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:46,831
spring rain

525
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,299
I gotta go

526
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,036
Are you going on a trip?

527
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,204
Moving to my mom's new home

528
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,908
Then you will often

529
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:57,942
Come and play with me

530
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,679
in another city

531
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:02,847
Very far

532
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,920
All right

533
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,988
goodbye

534
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,125
Let's go

535
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:15,560
Xiaolei

536
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,067
elder brother

537
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,005
Brother Xiaolei, don’t leave

538
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,339
Just stay here

539
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,607
I won't let you go

540
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,355
I promise you

541
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,390
spring rain

542
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,158
I will definitely come back

543
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,199
Then you can't lie to me

544
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,967
I do what I say

545
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,197
Tianji has agreed

546
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,265
Help us remove the chip

547
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,768
But remove the chip

548
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,002
will make people in the game

549
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:31,970
Have you all woken up?

550
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,347
The human brain is too complex

551
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,150
Anything can happen

552
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,120
Remember

553
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,922
Don't believe in secrets easily

554
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:18,750
Start

555
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,181
Moved Moved

556
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,250
Brother Qiang reacted

557
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:11,903
what are you doing

558
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,538
you all saw it

559
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,407
Consciousness return device

560
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,909
Can wake up your friends

561
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,377
But it's a deal after all

562
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,519
It doesn’t matter

563
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,921
Surgery first

564
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:30,922
I believe

565
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:31,923
Everything is normal after surgery

566
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,391
you will keep your promise

567
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,626
delete them

568
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,860
Let's get started

569
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,229
take them in

570
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,498
Wait a moment

571
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,102
spring rain

572
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,236
come with me

573
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:51,910
you

574
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,845
do you have any concerns

575
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,748
I still can't believe it

576
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:57,982
Yan Mingliang would be so easy

577
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,950
Let's quit the game

578
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:00,518
in addition

579
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,487
We were here the day before yesterday

580
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,354
The person I met

581
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,156
Don't you think he's abnormal?

582
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,391
I would like to ask

583
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,126
Are you still in the ghost building now?

584
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,060
Play as a non-player character?

585
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,863
I can't remember clearly

586
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,798
Recently transferred to the purchasing department

587
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,166
Things about the R&D center

588
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,034
I don't ask anymore

589
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,236
yes

590
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,438
He seems to have forgotten the game

591
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,006
all experiences that happened

592
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,443
Just in case

593
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,478
I mean just in case

594
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,081
It was also because he removed the chip

595
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,516
Just lost all my memory

596
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,386
What should I do?

597
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,628
but but we are now

598
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,729
There is no other choice

599
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:53,638
spring rain

600
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,041
In fact, the most important point

601
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,378
I don't want to forget this time

602
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,446
everything that happened

603
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,417
Especially with you

604
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,585
Those bits and pieces

605
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,154
Even if it's a minute or a second

606
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,357
I don't even want to forget

607
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,242
Brother Xiaolei

608
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,577
What book are you holding?

609
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:07,945
magic password

610
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:08,946
password

611
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,281

612
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:17,755
Come here dad

613
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:18,890
Stop hitting me

614
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:19,624
let you run

615
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,559
Dad, I know I was wrong

616
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,193
you run

617
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:22,627
dad

618
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,795
You brought this on yourself

619
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,163
Unfilial, get out

620
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,197
Don't come back

621
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,269
elder brother

622
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,147
It’s time to eat

623
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,365
spring rain

624
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:02,800
What's wrong with you

625
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,503
Roubaix, she lost her memory

626
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,071
Even her best friend

627
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,306
Xueli also forgot

628
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,978

629
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:20,384

630
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,528
Brother Xiaolei

631
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:05,396

633
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,669
so

634
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:12,937
Do not worry

635
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,272
There it is

636
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,108
I will never forget you

637
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,077
Everyone

638
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,579
After closing my eyes this time

639
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,513
I won’t have nightmares anymore

640
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,882
I hear what you mean

641
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:58,950
after we finish

642
00:36:58,983 --> 00:36:59,917
Do we still need to celebrate?

643
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,718
Three days and nights

644
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,553
I I don't have time

645
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,688
Celebrate for three days and three nights

646
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:04,889
I'm still very important

647
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:05,556
Such an important person

648
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,624
Waiting for me to fight for it

649
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,059
Wait until I recover

650
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,060
the first thing

651
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,027
Just find one

652
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,395
I won’t dislike my boyfriend

653
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:13,564

654
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,699
I don't dislike you

655
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,467
What does it have to do with you?

656
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,038
I'm just thinking

657
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,240
with wife and children

658
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,608
Living a good life is enough

659
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,142
What about you, Chun Yu?

660
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,538

661
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:01,579
