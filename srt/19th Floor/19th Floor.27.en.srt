1
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,370
Something might have happened in the control room

2
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,539
Everyone gathers in the control room

3
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:03,783
open the door

4
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,351
open the door

5
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:18,598
Black Er

6
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,636
Brother Qiang

7
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,276
Who released us?

8
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
Gao Xuan

9
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,849
It's Gao Xuan who came to save us.

10
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,618
Everyone come in

11
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,085
saved us

12
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:39,886
Seems

13
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,788
in the canteen

14
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,823
Yes, Bawan also told me

15
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,858
He took the initiative to save us

16
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,161
Eighty thousand

17
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,397
I just met a brother

18
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,899
He will also be your brother then

19
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,635
I thought it was all fake

20
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,637
Didn't expect it to be true

21
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,517
Then why doesn't Ayong come out?

22
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,553
Ayong

23
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:15,888
Ayong

24
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,558
Ayong

25
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:20,827
Ayong

26
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:22,962
Ayong

27
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:25,965
Ayong go

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,301
Go Ayong

29
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,502
Fake

30
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,037
Fake

31
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:37,543
Ayong

32
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:38,978
look at me

33
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,313
Come and see me brother

34
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:41,914
My strong brother

35
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,516
Black Er

36
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,520
Look at Brother Ayong

37
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:48,688
Ayong

38
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:49,922
Fake

39
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,658
Fake

40
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:53,359
I know

41
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,728
You've been here too long

42
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:57,830
what's happening now

43
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,698
You don't believe it

44
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:00,967
Come and see brother

45
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,168
Ah Yong, think about it

46
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:02,802
Fake

47
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,103
Just now in the cafeteria

48
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:05,672
think about it

49
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,006
Yes, did you see it?

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,207
Gao Xuan Chunyu

51
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,042
they came in

52
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,543
They came in and rescued us.

53
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:10,943
right

54
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:11,778
now the door is open

55
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,046
let's go together

56
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:13,880
we are safe

57
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,447
We're fine

58
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,581
You, all of you, get out of here

59
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,083
I do not go

60
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:17,550
Ayong

61
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,184
Get away

62
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,385
A Yong A Yong

63
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,121
Rolling, rolling

64
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:22,922
It's all over

65
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,856
It's all over, Ayong

66
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,624
Get out of here

67
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,065
Does it hurt?

68
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:35,702
It hurts

69
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,869
How could the pain be fake?

70
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:37,670
Ayong

71
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,404
Walk

72
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,273
We're really here to get you out

73
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:47,947
Brother Qiang

74
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,383
right

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,088
Black Er

76
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:05,865
why do you

77
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,033
why did you leave me

78
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:08,768
To save you

79
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,670
I don't even want my life anymore

80
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,473
Why did you leave me alone?

81
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,540
from childhood to adulthood

82
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,842
I listen to you in everything

83
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:16,876
I am delicious and fun

84
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,745
I'll give it all to you

85
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,913
Because I know you are my brother

86
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,682
If something happens to me, you will protect me

87
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,983
you will protect me

88
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,086
But why did you abandon me

89
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,488
Ayong

90
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,056
why abandon me

91
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,124
Ayong

92
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,225
It's all over

93
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,060
It's all over

94
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,862
I did not do it on purpose

95
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:38,765
that all things

96
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,233
happened too fast

97
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,436
I can't react at all

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,708
three of us

99
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,343
three of us

100
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,178
Wearing a pair of pants grew up

101
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,546
If I knew that was true

102
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,348
Will I not save you?

103
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,082
I don’t even want my life anymore

104
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,750
I won't let anything happen to you

105
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,519
but i didn't do it

106
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,222
elder brother

107
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:07,660
elder brother

108
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,228
elder brother

109
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,867
It's me who didn't protect you

110
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:15,768
You hit me

111
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:16,803
Hit me

112
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,337
elder brother

113
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:18,838
You hit me

114
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,474
Brother Brother Brother

115
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,479
Brother Qiang

116
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,156
Xiaoqin

117
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,625
Lao Gao succeeded

118
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,427
are you okay

119
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,196
Why did you smash the wall just now?

120
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,169
Are you two okay?

121
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,209
Quiet

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,244
Quiet

123
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,782
are you okay

124
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,517
Are you feeling better now?

125
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,153
You are all here

126
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,364
Where is the spring rain?

127
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,199
She was sent to the dungeon

128
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,143
Go save Chunyu

129
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:32,912
together we

130
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,286
What are you doing?

131
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,490
elder brother

132
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:09,916
return to

133
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,023
return to

134
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,144
Two more come to the control room

135
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,079
ready to break

136
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,481
control room

137
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,718
Gao Xuan is in danger

138
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,088
You two wait for me here

139
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,022
elder brother

140
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,591
Brother Xuan was the one who saved us before.

141
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,193
It's our turn now

142
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:27,860
Let's save him together

143
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,730
Brother Qiang, stop talking nonsense.

144
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,231
Wherever you go we will go

145
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,468
Are you going to save Gao Xuan?

146
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:38,904
Then I'm going too

147
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,673
He is my senior

148
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,208
I must go to save him

149
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:50,383
Walk

150
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:50,983
Walk

151
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,327
What's wrong, Xiaoqin?

152
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,625
Let's lure these guards away

153
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,461
Help Gao Xuan buy some time

154
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,262
good

155
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,437
brothers

156
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,006
Need help?

157
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,182
Stop

158
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:09,989
There are jailers there

159
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,023
Looks so fierce

160
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,925
You this and this

161
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,727
Can it be done?

162
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,000
What's up

163
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,835
They might leave

164
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,605
A few in area B

165
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,540
Escaped from the cell

166
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,507
I gonna go see

167
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:29,508
Don't move

168
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:30,609
Optimistic about the dungeon

169
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:31,477
receive

170
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,281
I

171
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:36,782
What should we do?

172
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,258
Think of another way

173
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,027
You can't just fight hard, right?

174
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,298
Quiet

175
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:13,752
How to open this?

176
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,720
They have cards on them

177
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,229
spring rain

178
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:31,937
Uncle Chun

179
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,408
spring rain

180
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,543
where are we going

181
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,045
Let’s go find Gao Xuanji first.

182
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,580
The annual meeting will help us open the door

183
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,515
If only I could find the secret door

184
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,350
can be destroyed

185
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,584
This harmful system

186
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,886
Time is limited

187
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,087
Let's escape first

188
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,921
Walk

189
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:50,623
Walk

190
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,190
Walk

191
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,399
Brother Qiang

192
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,168
This way

193
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,903
OK this way

194
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:04,703
Go quickly

195
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,277
This way, hurry up

196
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,082
Brother Qiang

197
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:17,483
Eighty thousand

198
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:18,484
Uncle Chun

199
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,319
The door is right ahead

200
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,153
Everyone follow me

201
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:21,820
Walk

202
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,122
Go Go

203
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,881
Finally a happy reunion

204
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,582
Victory Escape, Brother Qiang

205
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,300
Uncle Chun

206
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,868
This access control system is a bit complicated

207
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,514
Uncle Chun

208
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:23,916
What is this

209
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,184
decoder

210
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,586
It should have been given to me by Yongcheng

211
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,356
Why are you going to all this trouble?

212
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,590
Just open it directly

213
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,059
something

214
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,463
He can't do it either

215
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,049
We give Uncle Chun

216
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,150
Buy some time

217
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,351
no problem

218
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,585
Fight

219
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:36,622
Fight

220
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:39,658
superior

221
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,287
Xiaoqin

222
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,706
spring rain

223
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,381
spring rain

224
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,882
you are finally here

225
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,720
Are you hungry? Eat something quickly.

226
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,056
Xiaoqin, that one

227
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,424
Let's have a drink alone

228
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,159
OK

229
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,430
I wish us both a long life together

230
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,800
Make a cup

231
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,001
Make a cup

232
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,236
Make a cup

233
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,470
Make a cup

234
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,538
Don't, don't, don't

235
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,139
Make a cup

236
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,540
Don't, don't make noise, don't make noise

237
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,341
so many people

238
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,676
It's too high-profile to have a cup of tea. What are you doing?

239
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,877
Give me a cup, just give me a cup

240
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,187
sweet

241
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,189
Let's meet one too

242
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,659
Come, Auld Lang Syne

243
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,473
Come on, let me call first. Come on.

244
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,340
Come on, come on, come on

245
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,141
OK OK

246
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,109
Anxious to lose

247
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:58,477
Slow down

248
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,946
Come on come on come on

249
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,247
You come, you come, you come

250
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,115
Come on

251
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,182
You go first. You go first.

252
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:04,983
leave you

253
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:06,485
six

254
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:07,319
six passes

255
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:07,719
Come, come, come

256
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,020
dad

257
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,057
Xiaoqin

258
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,831
Old Yang’s daughter-in-law

259
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,166
Must play mahjong well

260
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,201
Uncle, I can't

261
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,903
Didn’t I teach you yesterday?

262
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,037
I can't fight

263
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,805
playing dice playing dice

264
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:38,650
play this card

265
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,985
Don't panic, keep up

266
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,388
bump bump bump bump

267
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,122
Eighty thousand

268
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,057
Wait a moment

269
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,392
Eighty thousand

270
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,060
Did I make peace?

271
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,099
Peace

272
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,005
Can't you play this?

273
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,209
Dongfeng

274
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,243
draw cards

275
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,145
Send cards forward

276
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,146
Eighty thousand

277
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:08,647
Wait a moment

278
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:10,949
Reconciled, reconciled again

279
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,784
Can't you play this?

280
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,619
Come on, come on, give it one last shot

281
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,724
Not anywhere

282
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,059
Xiaoqin

283
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,627
you you for a while

284
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,528
Give way to my dad

285
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:24,796
what

286
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,098
It's okay It's okay

287
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:27,833
You can play

288
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,202
Eighty thousand

289
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,704
Don't

290
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,273
peace, peace

291
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:37,909
No more playing

292
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,844
Come, come, come

293
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,377
I won’t play with you anymore

294
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,580
dad dad dad

295
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:43,648
no

296
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,083
Dad, please play some more

297
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,717
No more playing No more playing

298
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,618
What are you playing for? No more playing

299
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,519
No, no, Dad

300
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,120
Go, go, don’t play

301
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:49,921
dad

302
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:51,223
I

303
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,390
This is too urgent

304
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:53,658
Yes

305
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,960
Xiaoqin Xiaoqin Xiaoqin

306
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,528
Slow down. Slow down.

307
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,329
Xiaoqin

308
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,663
Xiaoqin, don't be angry

309
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,197
OK

310
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,065
you listen to me

311
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,066
Let me explain to you

312
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,234
Go away

313
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,235
No Xiaoqin

314
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,603
My dad didn't do that on purpose

315
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,604
You can't blame him

316
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:06,638
Yes or no

317
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,039
good

318
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,641
I don't blame him, then let me ask you

319
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:10,909
Why did you say something just now?

320
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,943
Don't even tell me

321
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:13,879
this this

322
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,514
Yang Bawan

323
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:16,982
I think the two of us

324
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:17,449
together

325
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,383
Not suitable at all

326
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,520
I think it's quite suitable

327
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,121
Where is the appropriate place?

328
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,489
Let me take drinking as an example

329
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,191
I like to drink Sprite

330
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,726
But you only like to drink Coke

331
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,661
Aren’t those all carbonated drinks?

332
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:30,462
and

333
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,763
I like watching suspense

334
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,831
You just love to see sweet pets

335
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:33,598
I love spicy food

336
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,699
You don't eat anything spicy at all

337
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,235
yes

338
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,303
Xiaoqin, look

339
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,404
We both have different hobbies

340
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,072
But we can love and live together

341
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,641
Isn’t this called complementarity?

342
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,075
What are they complementary to?

343
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,477
One pure green and one fiery red

344
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,077
go together

345
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,045
No longer ugly

346
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:57,989
I understand what you mean

347
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:05,830
yes

348
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,699
I also think we are not suitable for each other

349
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,034
Then break up

350
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,268
I'm not

351
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:10,635
Right

352
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,337
Nan Xiaoqin, let me tell you

353
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,705
do you know

354
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,673
You are a particularly self-righteous person

355
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,273
what happened

356
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,308
People who are all centered on themselves

357
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:17,742
drink different drinks

358
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:18,710
So what?

359
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:19,344
Why watch the drama?

360
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:19,978
You have to watch suspense only

361
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,079
You can't accompany me to watch Sweet Pets

362
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,480
I just want to eat lighter

363
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,548
Do you have to eat so spicy?

364
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,385
Playing mahjong is so serious

365
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,320
I told you

366
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,187
My father is impatient

367
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,021
You and he have so many cards

368
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,122
Can he not lift the table?

369
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:32,757
It's my fault too

370
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,260
good break up

371
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,062
I've had enough

372
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,700
Okay, let's break up then

373
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,599
What does it mean to last forever?

374
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,101
It’s only been a few days

375
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,103
Everything men say is lies

376
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,256
you let go

377
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,157
you let go

378
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:39,791
you let go

379
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,259
That's my potato

380
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,861
Chunyu, come and take a look

381
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,662
Coming Here Coming

382
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,230
Dad, what are you doing?

383
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,232
Can you still eat potatoes after they have sprouted?

384
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,433
I said I would throw it away to her

385
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,801
I still made mistakes. I still made mistakes.

386
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,002
you fart

387
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,437
This is how potatoes are eaten

388
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,005
We have eaten for so many years

389
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,906
Everything is fine

390
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,107
Isn’t that right? Chunyu

391
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,609
Dad, please stop saying a few words.

392
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,010
Can you please give in to grandma?

393
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,645
This is science, we can't let it

394
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,680
Bullshit science

395
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,481
My experience is science

396
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,082
Okay, grandma

397
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:04,916
Will you let go or not?

398
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,484
Will you let go or not?

399
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,153
Will you let go or not?

400
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:10,555
you old woman

401
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,990
You, you are still fooling around, right?

402
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,225
I have to throw it away to you today

403
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,473
Get out of here

404
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,507
Get out of here

405
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,543
Get out of here, get out of here

406
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,644
I'll leave as soon as I leave

407
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,179
Hey Xiaoqin

408
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,880
Chun Yu, I want to talk to you

409
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,082
Get out of here

410
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,882
I have something going on here

411
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,817
I'll tell you later

412
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,518
Okay, grandma

413
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,486
Okay, Okay, Okay

414
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,700
my potatoes

415
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:56,868
my potatoes

416
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,368
Come, come, come

417
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,103
my potatoes

418
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,204
It's okay, grandma

419
00:28:59,204 --> 00:28:59,804
It's OK

420
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:00,672
It's okay It's okay

421
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,241
Then I'll go out and take a look.

422
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,342
Grandma, it's okay

423
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:09,981
dad

424
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:10,548
dad

425
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:11,683
dad

426
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:13,885
Don't persuade me

427
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,720
I definitely won't go back

428
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:16,755
But dad

429
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,190
Don't speak for your grandma either

430
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,059
during this time

431
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,027
what did i do for her

432
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,596
You know it very well

433
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:25,497
But she

434
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,433
Forget it, don't mention this

435
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,801
Me and your grandma

436
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,203
We can never get along well

437
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,405
I won't come to this place again

438
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,178
We, father and daughter

439
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,314
Let’s get together when you have time

440
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,084
dad

441
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:55,860
Be more honest with me

442
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,828
I didn't want to lie to you

443
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,629
I didn't lie to you

444
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,997
If you can, fly out

445
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:00,765
you are a liar

446
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:01,833
Still don't admit it

447
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,767
You big liar

448
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,501
I'm not a liar

449
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,602
I didn't want to lie to everyone

450
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,904
you did it on purpose

451
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,405
Can you please listen to my explanation?

452
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,273
I didn't want to lie

453
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,307
What else do you have to explain?

454
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,275
you are a liar

455
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,042
spring rain

456
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:11,776
come and save me

457
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:12,577
they want to beat me

458
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,278
Brother Qiang

459
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,281
Who wants to hit you?

460
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,949
We just want you to pay back the money

461
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:18,683
Want me to pay back the money

462
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,551
And locked me up

463
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,552
In each of your hands

464
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,553
Everyone is holding something

465
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,388
If you really don’t pay back the money today

466
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,689
Just don't blame us

467
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,623
You're welcome

468
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:26,591
Uncle Chen

469
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,225
Don't worry

470
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,226
Don't worry, everyone.

471
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,661
This is my friend. What's wrong?

472
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:30,929
Spring rain

473
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,263
Just stop getting involved

474
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,499
This man is a big liar

475
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:35,800
He was there a few days ago

476
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,169
Fooling the elderly in our community

477
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,404
trade-in

478
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:40,805
Send home appliances

479
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,040
result

480
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,408
Charged a lot of money

481
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,909
Didn't see a single appliance

482
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:45,510
is not it

483
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,244
Yes, yes

484
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:46,878
Nothing is left

485
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,479
You liar, pay me back

486
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,581
Is it true, Brother Qiang?

487
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,849
I never thought about it

488
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:51,749
to deceive anyone

489
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,018
That project is Hei Er and A Yong

490
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:54,786
Two people talked

491
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,220
they say

492
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,920
They know a boss

493
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:56,821
They are distant relatives

494
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:57,789
Very reliable

495
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:58,756
Then the day before yesterday I

496
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,924
I went to check the goods

497
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:00,725
no problem

498
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:01,793
Then today I

499
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,861
I'm going to take you with me

500
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,395
When I go to the warehouse to pick up the goods

501
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,763
Goods in the warehouse

502
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,497
All gone

503
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,200
That person is gone too

504
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,069
Hei Er and A Yong

505
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,170
Both of them are gone too.

506
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:15,206
look

507
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:17,642
Brother Qiang

508
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,110
I died once for you

509
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,912
You have to give me something back

510
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,046
don't blame me

511
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:25,917
All phones are turned off

512
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,785
No matter how hard I try, I can't get through.

513
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,860
I did something wrong before

514
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,561
But I think

515
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,062
I was punished too

516
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,164
I also took both of them

517
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,466
All were rescued

518
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:43,835
but why

519
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,436
All brothers remain loyal to the end

520
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,337
everything has become

521
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,505
tool of profit

522
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,874
Me and the two of them

523
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,042
Have known each other for more than ten years

524
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,044
More than ten years

525
00:31:59,284 --> 00:31:59,884
Then everyone

526
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,787
This time I'm sorry to everyone

527
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,523
I'm out of stock now

528
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,258
My money is gone too

529
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,996
Then I'll risk my life

530
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:12,764
Come

531
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:14,599
Don't, don't, don't

532
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:15,566
Don't do this

533
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,200
okay

534
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,002
What are you trying to do with your life?

535
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:18,870
Brother Qiang, like this

536
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,204
Go and wait for me at Uncle Chen's place

537
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,639
I'll go find Gao Xuan and the others to find a solution.

538
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,040
no

539
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,608
You, leave it alone, trust me

540
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:26,477
Let's go

541
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:28,880
Let's go

542
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,048
Cause trouble

543
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:30,682
This is a big deal

544
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,249
spring rain

545
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:32,750
go quickly

546
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,242
elder brother

547
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,478
elder brother

548
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:08,486
elegant

549
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,122
spring rain

550
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,158
what to do

551
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,194
Blame me

552
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,662
What shouldn't I report?

553
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,997
Celebrity training class

554
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,399
I shouldn't worry about my brother borrowing money

555
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,835
This way he won't work overtime

556
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,737
There won't be a car accident

557
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,804
Which of you is following the car?

558
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:28,706
I

559
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,440
Hurry up Hurry up

560
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,155
Hello

561
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:17,989
Uncle Chen

562
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,624
Is it spring rain?

563
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,025
Something happened to your grandma

564
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,860
Go to Guangming Hospital quickly

565
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:27,965
dad

566
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,067
spring rain

567
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,634
How is my grandma?

568
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,402
Rescue is in progress

569
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:32,437
good

570
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,044
doctor said

571
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,548
Maybe the situation is not good

572
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,717
Be mentally prepared

573
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:58,830
spring rain

574
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,697
Are you okay?

575
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:03,835
Didn't you say

576
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:04,669
Didn't you say

577
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,137
Do you want to start over?

578
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,739
Didn't you say we should

579
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,241
Are we well together?

580
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,343
Why do you have to be angry with her?

581
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,912
Can't you just give her some space?

582
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,018
sorry

583
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,406
I'm really sorry

584
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,308
we have tried our best
