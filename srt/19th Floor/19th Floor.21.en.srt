1
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,120
spring rain

2
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:08,621
Uncle Lin

3
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:10,723
Master Lin

4
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,691
you are back

5
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:12,959
Your daughter comes to you

6
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,194
I let her in

7
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,195
she

8
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,696
Take out that computer quickly

9
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,932
Little girl, let me tell you

10
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,400
Your father loves you very much

11
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,901
he spent a lot of money

12
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,369
I bought an expensive one

13
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,137
laptop computer

14
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,205
Just waiting for you to come

15
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,072
It's for you

16
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,974
Master Lin, hurry up

17
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:28,741
she is not

18
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:29,676
Sorry, right?

19
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,610
I'll get it for you

20
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:32,979
With your own children

21
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,513
What's there to be embarrassed about?

22
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,714
Don't go through my stuff, you

23
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,682
Don't think I don't know

24
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,115
Don't go through my things

25
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:36,482
Just put it

26
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,183
Under this sheet

27
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,485
Okay, okay, okay

28
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,720
Get out quickly, get out

29
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,355
Hello

30
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:43,456
Hello

31
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,390
Is it spring rain?

32
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,458
yes

33
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,893
Could you please come to the school gate?

34
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,794
Your grandma

35
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:48,928
Big aunt

36
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:49,762
What happened to my grandma?

37
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,496
Are you okay? This is

38
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,298
No, she is here. She is in the guard room.

39
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,099
Anyway, come here quickly

40
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:53,733
good

41
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,434
What happened to your grandma?

42
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,202
I don't know. It's at the door.

43
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,503
I'll go with you to see

44
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,005
Let's go

45
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,472
Walk

46
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,475
Sit first. Sit first.

47
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,479
It's serious again

48
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:07,647
grandma

49
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:08,781
grandma

50
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:09,916
Light rain

51
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,417
Spring rain, right?

52
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,119
You're finally here

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,654
Your grandma insists on going in

54
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,655
What can I get you to eat?

55
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
But we have rules

56
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,957
No one from outside the school is allowed in now

57
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,125
you also know

58
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,493
I've been organizing fire drills for the past two days.

59
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,329
I brought you drunken shrimps

60
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,964
This can't be let go

61
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:25,765
Tell me

62
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,967
I came out as soon as I went in

63
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,369
I'll just put it there and come out

64
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,503
Why don't you let me in?

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,337
Why don't you let me in?

66
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:31,838
grandma

67
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:32,438
Why don't you let me in?

68
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,273
We really have rules

69
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,140
Not allowed in

70
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:36,876
grandma

71
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,111
Thank you for bringing it to me

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,445
My favorite drunken shrimp

73
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,080
But it's really a school

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,181
There are school regulations

75
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:42,849
This way

76
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,850
I'll go back with you

77
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,118
Let's eat together, okay?

78
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,420
no, I'm fine

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,155
You take it back

80
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,356
Sharing a dormitory with you

81
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,058
Those students shared the food

82
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,961
well

83
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,728
Then I'll go back

84
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,397
Go back. Goodbye, grandma.

85
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:58,765
Goodbye, grandma

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,100
What's wrong? What's wrong?

87
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,834
What's wrong? What's wrong?

88
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,002
waist waist waist

89
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:03,670
go to hospital

90
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,338
waist waist waist

91
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,639
Can I go to the hospital?

92
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,373
Go to the hospital

93
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,075
Is this your old habit?

94
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,447
Then let me accompany you to take grandma home.

95
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,315
good

96
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,183
Go, go, go, go, go

97
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,052
Go slower. Go slower.

98
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:19,752
I'm going to call a taxi

99
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,420
Call a cab Call a cab

100
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,055
Call a car. Call a car. Slow down.

101
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,432
Xiaoqin

102
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,200
You also took this course

103
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:48,781
Where is Yang Bawan?

104
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:50,750
I do not know

105
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,085
You probably haven't taken this class, right?

106
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,462
Really, stop thinking about that.

107
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,297
Live well now

108
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,631
We'll get through it together

109
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,578
Xiaoqin

110
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,249
elegant

111
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,550
Help me move a little over there

112
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:25,852
OK

113
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,990
Don't forget what I said this morning

114
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:33,960
understand

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,528
Time and space

116
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,041
I sit here

117
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,443
This space is enough, right?

118
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,852
Dear classmates, class has begun.

119
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,856
Come and start class

120
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,057
Open page seven

121
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,300
Slow down a little

122
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,574
Slow down

123
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,409
slow down slow down

124
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,977
Pad, pad, pad, pad

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,914
It's raining

126
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,615
Go and get Uncle Lin a glass of water.

127
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,082
good

128
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,317
No need, I'll go back now

129
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,919
No, Uncle Lin, sit down. Sit down.

130
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,555
You have to drink water no matter what.

131
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,756
OK OK

132
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,257
Come

133
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:46,966
Come

134
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,035
Look at you

135
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:49,936
Problems with hairy hands and feet

136
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:50,970
When can it be changed?

137
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,171
It's okay. I'm sorry.

138
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:52,672
You see, it's all wet

139
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,739
It's okay It's okay

140
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,640
Just got a little water on it

141
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,476
It's okay It's okay

142
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,645
So nervous about this book

143
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,380
What is written in it?

144
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,683
This water is cold

145
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,618
Go get a cup of something hot.

146
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,153
good

147
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,322
Sorry, Uncle Lin

148
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,758
Look at this kid

149
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:15,895
Are you okay?

150
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,863
It's okay It's okay

151
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,538
grandma

152
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,139
You made dumplings

153
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,575
The stuffing has already been prepared

154
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,110
Just not rolling the dough

155
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,011
That's not thinking

156
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,312
Waiting for you to come back to eat?

157
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,481
No rolling

158
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,083
Neither can I

159
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,085
Uncle Lin

160
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,253
Otherwise, you teach me

161
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,921
Stay and let's have a meal together

162
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,422
Look, look, look

163
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,690
How nice this girl is

164
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,959
They still have to cook for the students.

165
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,161
I happen to have no work in the cafeteria today

166
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:50,663
I'm fine anyway

167
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,032
That spring rain period

168
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,033
always helping me

169
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,701
It just so happens that I can give something back.

170
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,602
Right, right

171
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,303
All right

172
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,571
where are the dumplings

173
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,072
Grandma is waiting

174
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,174
It's good to be in love. It's good to be in love.

175
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,943
Let me give you a hand

176
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:04,777
Need not

177
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,778
Just watch it

178
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,017
By the way, Xiaoyu

179
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,652
Our electric cooker is broken

180
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,553
are you looking for someone

181
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,720
Come and fix it

182
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:15,688
OK

183
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,724
Why don't you show it to me?

184
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,127
good

185
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,562
OK

186
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,303
this

187
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,470
look

188
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,805
It doesn’t feel easy to fix

189
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,973
take a look

190
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,448
There's no light here

191
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,818
Maybe it's a bad contact?

192
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,954
Do you have an electrician’s kit at home?

193
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,326
have

194
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,640
Nian Yongcheng rejected my request for help

195
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,675
I've been to the device management center

196
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:10,810
but there

197
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,511
The required access card permissions are very high

198
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,950
Go to the office of Chief Engineer 202 to find it

199
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,901
Do you know Chun Yiming?

200
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,803
Does he have anything to do with all this?

201
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,272
Got the pulse device

202
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,474
Let's get in touch again

203
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,392
Gao Gonghao

204
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,594
Need help?

205
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,162
unnecessary

206
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:44,497
I'll go back first

207
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,164
Thank you

208
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,088
Uncle Lin

209
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,790
Do you know how to do this?

210
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,659
When I first moved to the city, I worked as an electrician.

211
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,799
It's bright, it's bright, it's bright

212
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:20,766
Really good

213
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,568
Then go ahead and make dumplings

214
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:24,570
good

215
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,005
Grandma is waiting

216
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,163
grandma

217
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,965
Why did you come out?

218
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,366
Where are you sitting and resting?

219
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,969
I'm here to supervise the work

220
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,270
overseer

221
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,371
We can't be lazy

222
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,773
What kind of work are you supervising?

223
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,675
you are not lazy

224
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,410
I'm afraid you'll cut corners

225
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,450
Look, look, look

226
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,015
Look at this girl doing some work

227
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,317
It's everywhere

228
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,919
You want to use a cover to do some work?

229
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,521
I'm afraid people don't know

230
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,156
She seems to be working

231
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,327
Master Lin

232
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,430
Today we have this dumpling stuffing

233
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,566
I didn't cut the onions.

234
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,404
I miss my daughter

235
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,373
me and her

236
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,041
Long time no see

237
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,646
Miss my daughter

238
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,215
Let me tell you a good way

239
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,850
You

240
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,120
Send your thoughts and thoughts

241
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,888
Put it all into the stuffing

242
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,990
Put it into the skin

243
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,192
Pinch, pinch, pinch

244
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:27,960
cooked

245
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,962
You can see it when you eat it.

246
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,399
Eat well and have sweet dreams

247
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,769
It would be nice to see her

248
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,673
Seeing things in dreams is also seeing things, right?

249
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,878
The water is boiling

250
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,246
Come

251
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,881
Dumplings are served

252
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,082
I'll take this plate over too.

253
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,418
Let’s make dumplings

254
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,525
Dumplings are coming

255
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,392
Coming, coming, coming

256
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,195
Master Lin

257
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,163
Today

258
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,631
We should be a family

259
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,598
Have a good meal

260
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,700
OK

261
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,301
You try it

262
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,170
Taste. Let's start eating.

263
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,204
Start eating

264
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:12,838
Come, come, come

265
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,472
Start eating

266
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,274
thank you thank you

267
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,408
Come on, come on, come on

268
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,142
OK thank you thank you

269
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,277
I'll do it myself I'll do it myself

270
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,713
And you did this all

271
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,014
You are too kind.

272
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,086
spring rain

273
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,153
are you

274
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,688
Are you interested in this book of mine?

275
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,156
I

276
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,291
Look

277
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,292
these are all mine

278
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,460
Some daily notes

279
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,975
It's a recipe

280
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,877
Our leader said

281
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,780
Today’s students have more picky tastes

282
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,815
Let me make some more new dishes

283
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,884
I'll study this all day long

284
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,619
Professional

285
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,355
Stop looking

286
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,357
Come on, come on, eat, eat, eat

287
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,125
good

288
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:06,725
Hurry up

289
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,161
Tell me how delicious the drunken shrimp is

290
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:10,529
Hurry up

291
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,530
Yes, try it, try it, eat it quickly

292
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,398
okay

293
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,820
I got the access card

294
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,088
You are Chun Yiming

295
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,605
Uncle Lin worked as an electrician

296
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,774
So it's possible to open that door

297
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,177
notebooks and recipes

298
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,711
There are reasonable explanations

299
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,885
That is to say

300
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,021
His identity is now suspected

301
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,956
Only Chun Yiming is left

302
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,092
If Chun Yiming

303
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,393
That's Mazzolini

304
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,882
That Gao Xuan

305
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,851
What's the relationship with him?

306
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,603
where

307
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,276
Something urgent

308
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,277
getting ready to go out

309
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,478
Will contact you later

310
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,762
0419

311
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,573
bastard

312
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,009
what are you doing

313
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,278
As heartless as your mother

314
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,248
If you have the guts, you can go too.

315
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,450
Pour me wine

316
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,818
Pour me wine

317
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,173
That was when we were young

318
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,875
the day we met

319
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,755
You just said self-developed equipment

320
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,189
I really want to know more about it

321
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,090
this

322
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,092
What about self-developed equipment?

323
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,328
Involving some company secrets

324
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,397
I'm afraid it's not very convenient

325
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:18,930
OK

326
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,898
I particularly understand

327
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,044
Gao Xuan

328
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,446
Don't let me down

329
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,383
good

330
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,183
Hello Chunyu

331
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,117
where are you

332
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,252
outside

333
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,353
tell you

334
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,321
i found one

335
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,355
very important thing

336
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,497
If something happens, let’s talk again

337
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,857
my good daughter

338
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,160
You are such a smart boy

339
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,094
Before your father

340
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,496
Is a senior engineer at Micro Technology

341
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,296
My project is signed

342
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,631
These two companies are so closely connected

343
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,599
After your father resigned

344
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,100
Nothing has been touched here

345
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,071
This is the annual general office

346
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,139
These two companies

347
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,340
The business content is quite close

348
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,274
This shows that between them

349
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,175
have some kind of connection

350
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,143
have a friend

351
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,078
Please fully support my research

352
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,001
Sure enough, all this

353
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,836
It all has something to do with you

354
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,719
you are finally here

355
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,520
my daughter

356
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,534
I know

357
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,136
You have many questions in your mind

358
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,739
I'll tell you everything now

359
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,208
However

360
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,577
Where to start?

361
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,079
spring rain

362
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,715
have you experienced

363
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,717
Feeling lonely?

364
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,722
Not the kind of loneliness you think

365
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,324
is a kind of

366
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,993
You can obviously fly to the nine heavens

367
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,529
But found myself lurking in the abyss

368
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,433
Do you know this feeling

369
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,402
Dad, play with me

370
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,376
Maybe in the eyes of many people

371
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,778
I'm all happy

372
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,847
I am thirty years old

373
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,282
became a professor

374
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,551
Have a wife

375
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,053
have kids

376
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,522
Seems extremely happy

377
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,457
But deep in my heart

378
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,993
I always feel lonely

379
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,363
And this feeling of loneliness

380
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,198
getting stronger

381
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm obviously a genius

382
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,003
Now I have to do it every day

383
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,938
Doing the most mediocre things

384
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,740
So I have my mother and me

385
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,941
you don't feel happy

386
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,042
Instead, I feel lonely

387
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,410
don't interrupt me

388
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,048
sorry

389
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,418
Please let me finish my words first

390
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,488
this feeling of loneliness

391
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,523
let me suddenly understand

392
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,526
This world is so boring

393
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,762
it has too many flaws

394
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,797
And with my talent

395
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,832
absolutely okay

396
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,500
Create a world yourself

397
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,402
a perfect world

398
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,408
soon

399
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,011
I found a guy called

400
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,312
Yan Mingliang person

401
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,214
he is very rich

402
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:37,849
and

403
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,650
He is not just a businessman

404
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,319
He has ideals

405
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,653
Feelings

406
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,088
so

407
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,657
He was soon impressed by me

408
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,659
Decided to participate in my project

409
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,294
So

410
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,963
I have a direction again

411
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:53,564
That's a paragraph

412
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,966
very nice day

413
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,735
simple pure

414
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,371
Only the ideal in front of me

415
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,673
do you know

416
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,009
The charm of ideal lies in

417
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,844
as long as you work hard enough

418
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,679
it can

419
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,882
approaching you infinitely

420
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:53,758
How is it

421
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:54,759
we succeeded

422
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:55,960
Successful

423
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:57,662
Successful

424
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,566
No

425
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,037
not enough

426
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,539
everyone thinks

427
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:09,440
This is called

428
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,409
The system of the future micro world

429
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,711
Already good enough

430
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,079
But in my heart

431
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,614
Still feel

432
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,084
It's not in my mind yet

433
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,419
ideal world

434
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,455
It seems to be missing something

435
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,892
It's like writing a play

436
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,160
No drama

437
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,728
Draw a dragon

438
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,730
no eyes

439
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,198
What it lacks is

440
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,801
What it lacks is soul

441
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:38,903
After a long time

442
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,271
A period of research and development

443
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,040
We're finally in beta

444
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,155
bright

445
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,192
bright

446
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:17,975
bright

447
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,076
Yan Mingliang

448
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,444
wake up

449
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,080
wake up bright

450
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,620
How is it possible?

451
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,558
This is a virtual world

452
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,894
How could he be in a coma?

453
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:44,969
bright

454
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,337
Yan Mingliang

455
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,605
bright

456
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,573
Mr. Yan

457
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,141
Mr. Yan Mr. Yan

458
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,542
Quick hit 120

459
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:52,977
No

460
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,179
wait a moment

461
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,220
Mr. Yan Mr. Yan

462
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,362
bright

463
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,431
bright

464
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,171
woke up

465
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,772
Mr. Yan, are you okay?

466
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,311
I am

467
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,114
Passed out in the system

468
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,085
How could this happen?

469
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,420
It was the moment when I fell into the water just now

470
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,222
Because of extreme fright

471
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:39,690
your brain

472
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,292
briefly lost consciousness

473
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,594
Comatose in the system

474
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,397
This is quite a loophole

475
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,032
What to do

476
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:48,799
Don't we

477
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,534
Aren’t all these years of hard work in vain?

478
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:54,572
No

479
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,242
it became

480
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,478
at that moment

481
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:01,712
I know

482
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,014
I'm looking forward to it

483
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,682
perfect world for life

484
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,851
It's finally coming

485
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,419
soon

486
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,254
I took out one

487
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,356
Comprehensive upgraded design plan

488
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,525
Nineteenth floor
