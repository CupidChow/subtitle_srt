1
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,920
So it's all a game

2
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Welcome to the nineteenth floor

3
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,880
Tasks in this level

4
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,480
Get rid of evil spirits

5
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
Complete the Deserted Village Festival

6
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,240
Coming

7
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,600
That piece of cloth you just mentioned

8
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,680
Is there anything special?

9
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,520
Still remember our first time

10
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
Enter the ghost building hall

11
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,160
After the opera started

12
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,520
Before Hei Er was killed

13
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,600
There is a person who is shadow puppet

14
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Kill with one knife?

15
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,200
I was in the corridor

16
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,440
The person you are talking about

17
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,360
I really haven't seen it

18
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,560
the clothes on his body

19
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,080
The same piece of cloth you got

20
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,920
Material and color are exactly the same

21
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
And before I

22
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,040
In Building 19 of the school

23
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
Met him once too

24
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
so you are saying

25
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,560
That piece of cloth of mine

26
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Maybe it's his clothes

27
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
He may be another player

28
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe he can know some secrets

29
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,400
spring rain

30
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,560
spring rain

31
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,200
I just received a message

32
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,960
What game is about to start

33
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
And then I'm here

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Nineteenth floor

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,880
You also received it

36
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,760
It seems the game is about to begin

37
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,120
Let's go

38
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
spring rain

39
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,360
I am afraid

40
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
can we get away from this

41
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's go

42
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,000
If we say

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
If this is a game

44
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,480
So how did we get in?

45
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,240
After SMS prompt

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
Let's get into the game

47
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,840
Maybe it has something to do with the mobile phone

48
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,120
Makes sense

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
Maybe the other party is through the mobile phone

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,000
fired some

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
special radio frequency signal

52
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
It affects our brains

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,120
transmit signal

54
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Then there must be a brain too

55
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,600
carrier for receiving signals

56
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,840
for example

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
Such as chips

58
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
Maybe in our brains

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,480
Implanted with some kind of chip

61
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,760
That’s why I entered the game

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,040
wafer

63
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,600
Then when will we

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,640
The implanted chip

65
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,320
Hospital?

66
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,800
Although I went to the hospital,

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,600
I don't live

68
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,160
They shouldn't have a chance

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
That's what we experienced together

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
one thing

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Just implanted

72
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
what have you done recently

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,360
Something special?

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
virtual reality helmet

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
You wore that helmet too

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,840
Is it at the school gate?

77
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
On the day of the opening ceremony

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,360
I tried it on at a tech show

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,120
virtual reality helmet

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,840
Are you guys too?

81
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,720
you you this

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
This is the latest

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,840
virtual reality

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,360
Awesome

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,920
Can play games

86
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,000
What came to mind

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm waiting for someone

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
if he comes

89
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Just prove it with that helmet

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,400
does it really matter

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,560
spring rain

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
You didn't go back to the dormitory at night

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
where have you been

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,160
at his home

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,760
his home

96
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,720
Someone is coming

97
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,720
uncle

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,320
uncle

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,000
Hello everyone

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,480
uncle

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,360
Uncle, your legs are healed

102
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,800
This time it was fine as soon as I came out.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,640
It seems that in the game

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,680
Last injury

105
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,840
It won't last until this time

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:41,880
who

107
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,240
Brother Qiang

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
It's you guys again

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,360
Is your friend feeling better now?

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
help me

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Game causes coma

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Still here with me

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,200
Ah Yong, that one

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,440
The doctor said it's okay

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
Just stay in the hospital for two days and you'll be fine

116
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,360
The Great Demon King of Spring Rain

117
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,240
so many of you

118
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,160
Play this game

119
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
Senior Gao also plays

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,480
who are you

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I am Yang Bawan

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,000
This

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,120
I said there are so many of you

124
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,440
play games

125
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,360
Why not pick up the equipment?

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,040
You are a group now

127
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Senior, listen to me

128
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,560
I am very good at playing games

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,080
I have rich experience

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,880
I am a master

131
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
You just need a group leader now

132
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,760
let me join you

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
I will definitely take you away

134
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,880
Are you wearing that helmet?

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,280
Yes

136
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,400
As soon as I put on my helmet I'm in.

137
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,120
look

138
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
This game is so realistic, right?

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,200
It is you

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,600
This game is not that simple

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,680
your first time in

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Try not to wander around

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,600
follow us

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,440
That's right

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
All listen to Brother Xuan

146
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,880
You want my equipment

147
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,440
is not it

148
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,320
Come and give it to you

149
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,240
one point

150
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
This fool

151
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
I want to play naked and pass the level without any damage.

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,080
right

153
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,160
Come, let me accompany you

154
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,440
let's go

155
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,680
I lead the way

156
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,400
I've gotten through all the pictures

157
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,160
I'm very familiar with

158
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,600
Walk

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,280
The show is about to begin

160
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,880
classmates

161
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,160
Senior Gao, let me tell you

162
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,960
It's just a game

163
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
I've played so many games

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,240
After a while, the bag will fly and you will win.

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,520
Now this game

166
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,960
It was really expensive to do it.

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
Look how realistic this scene is

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't move

169
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,120
Don't touch that hand everywhere

170
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,880
I'm warning you

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
This is no ordinary game

172
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,680
no

173
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,040
They are all veteran drivers.

174
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,120
Why are you so nervous?

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,120
Everyone

176
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,360
Let's take a look around first

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,720
If there is anything unusual

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,760
Give me a prompt notification

179
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,040
Pay attention to safety

180
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,440
I told you not to touch

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
you follow me

182
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Brother Gao, let me tell you

183
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
I have a lot of experience playing this

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,120
Brother Xuan

185
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Let's work together in pairs for a while.

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,600
I cover you

187
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:14,760
I cover you

188
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,560
Etc., etc

189
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,080
This big brother

190
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Everyone has said it

191
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,160
Check them separately

192
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,200
You go over there and take a look.

193
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,320
Who do I follow is none of your business?

194
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,920
go away

195
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,000
Chunyu, come quickly

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,520
Go over and have a look

197
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,360
Senior

198
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,080
This handprint

199
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
Why are they as big as my hands?

200
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,080
What's up

201
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,120
Six people, seven palm prints

202
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
Are there other players?

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,840
This way

204
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,760
Let's look for it

205
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,240
corresponding palm prints

206
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,080
Maybe

207
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
Can there be any new clues?

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,600
clues

209
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,160
If you touch

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
What kind of agency is this? What should I do?

211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,400
If you don't want to try

212
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,560
There's no way to pass the level

213
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Brother, just give it a try

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Just a game

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
This is mine

216
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,160
Brother Qiang

217
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,960
Brother, press it

218
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,400
no

219
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,320
laugh

220
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
You pressed too fast

221
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
That's an invalid touch

222
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,440
Didn't I press it?

223
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,080
I haven't pressed it yet

224
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
You press it longer

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,880
careful

226
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,160
this friend

227
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
This effect is really good

228
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,600
What are you going to do?

229
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,840
Senior

230
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,360
Don't be surprised

231
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,000
Isn't she just a

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,400
Non-player character?

233
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,560
How can she eat me?

234
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,200
Game triggered

235
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,560
Please choose someone

236
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,680
Enter the coffin

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,520
Before the incense burns out

238
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,160
Please choose the person who will enter the coffin

239
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,040
Game starts

240
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:58,880
no

241
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,480
Then she didn't say anything

242
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
Why choose someone

243
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,040
Into the coffin

244
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,840
What's in the coffin?

245
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,160
What if I don’t choose?

246
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,840
Someone will die

247
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
What else would happen?

248
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,000
I think everyone

249
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,840
You should listen to what I have to say

250
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,640
I found this incense burns very quickly

251
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,040
so we shouldn't

252
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,640
waste of time

253
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,920
I think we are now

254
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,560
should vote

255
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Raise your hand and throw someone in

256
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,800
I know everyone

257
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,040
There is a big misunderstanding about me now

258
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
But I have to tell you

259
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
I grew up

260
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,840
It's the god of death

261
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,160
I've had fights

262
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,520
There are not even a thousand but there are eight hundred

263
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,400
leave me outside

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,800
is to help the team

265
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,600
best choice

266
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,040
we should choose one

267
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,000
the weakest person

268
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,640
Get into this coffin

269
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,040
What I said makes sense, right?

270
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,240
spring rain

271
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,320
you you know

272
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm afraid of the dark

273
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
Can you not let me in?

274
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,280
no

275
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,320
Then you have to say this

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
You can't choose me either

277
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
I was beaten by my father

278
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,680
grown up

279
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,680
I particularly bear the beating

280
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,520
You need someone

281
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,880
Help you bear the damage, right?

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
So senior

283
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,120
Classmate Chunyu

284
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,440
Classmate of Chunyu classmate

285
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,800
And the canteen chef

286
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,440
My surname is Lin

287
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,640
Master Lin

288
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,480
classmates

289
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,440
Please don't choose me

290
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,320
Ruined

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
They are all from the same school

292
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,840
Then wait a minute

293
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,800
You must choose me to be put in the coffin.

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,520
Look at the fragrance

295
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,320
Let's not waste time

296
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,160
I think now outside it is

297
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,000
Ghostly

298
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,440
It might be the safest inside

299
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,880
You should take the strong me

300
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,600
stay outside

301
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,440
help you

302
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,960
Let's choose one immediately

303
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,720
The weakest goes in

304
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,520
I think this

305
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,280
That makes sense

306
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
Then the weakest person here

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,600
Hurry up

308
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,400
Let's stop nagging

309
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,960
The incense is gone. Choose somewhere quickly.

310
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,160
Let's quickly choose one

311
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,200
spring rain

312
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
You think so too, right?

313
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,200
Quiet

314
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,840
time is up

315
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Game starts

316
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,440
Task

317
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
Stop evil spirits

318
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,800
spring rain

319
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,800
why do you

320
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,040
Locked me in

321
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,520
Quiet

322
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,640
None of your friends want you

323
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,160
They all left you

324
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,600
Your best friend Chunyu

325
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,200
I don’t want you anymore

326
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,320
stay

327
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
stay with me

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,040
let me out let me out

329
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,880
let me out

330
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
Finished

331
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Speak clearly

332
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,240
What kind of evil spirit can you immobilize?

333
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,800
What kind of evil spirit can you immobilize?

334
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,720
What is an evil spirit?

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,560
Senior

336
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,400
what is that

337
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,520
Is that the evil spirit?

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,440
careful

339
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,480
Get out of the way

340
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,120
Quiet

341
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Quiet

342
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,400
let me out

343
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,960
Is there anyone?

344
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
they are all the same

345
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
Will only bully you

346
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,800
no one cares about your feelings

347
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,320
The same goes for spring rain

348
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,920
She doesn't care about your life or death.

349
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,720
let me out

350
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,120
let me out

351
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,320
let me out

352
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
let me out

353
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,920
Let me out Chunyu

354
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
let me out

355
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,360
Uncle Lin

356
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,240
be careful

357
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,760
good

358
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
Uncle Lin, are you okay?

359
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,720
It's OK

360
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,480
so

361
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800
The weakness of this thing

362
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,560
It's on the head

363
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,880
So this evil spirit

364
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,560
It doesn’t work even if you look at it

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,880
I feel like I can survive another beating.

366
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,720
Hit your head, hit it

367
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,720
Attack on the head

368
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,200
Beauty

369
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,520
Just now

370
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,200
thank you

371
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,960
Don't take it to heart to lift a knife.

372
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,080
That me

373
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,800
My name is Yang Bawan

374
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,520
What's your name?

375
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,800
Doudou

376
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,760
The surname is Dou and the given name is Dou.

377
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,520
What a good name

378
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,920
let me out

379
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,080
let me out

380
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,200
let me out

381
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,280
spring rain

382
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,440
You clearly know that I'm afraid of the dark

383
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Why are you locking me in?

384
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,080
spring rain

385
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,080
The evil spirit has been determined

386
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,800
Game cleared

387
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,360
Sorry

388
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,480
Let me get you a glass of water

389
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Drinking water overnight is not good for your health

390
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,560
Drink this new cup

391
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,400
Thank you

392
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,120
Congratulations on being in the Nineteenth Floor Game

393
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,960
Survival time exceeds twenty hours

394
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,040
Tianji Technology sincerely invites you

395
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,520
Participate in the 19th floor trial signing meeting

396
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,320
Address: No. 188, Tianhe East Road

397
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,360
you decide to go

398
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,120
But this could be a trap

399
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,080
But don't go

400
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,320
We will never know the truth

401
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,040
me and you togather

402
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
She didn't come back last night

403
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,200
Then why don't you call and ask?

404
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,080
where did she go

405
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,600
No

406
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,080
It's your big weekend

407
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,760
Can you let people sleep in?

408
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,200
My name is Doudou

409
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,160
Eighty thousand

410
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,680
I might

411
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,840
It's love

412
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,040
Still sleeping A Yong

413
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,240
Just sleep in broad daylight

414
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,440
Do you want to drink milk?

415
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,160
Are there bananas to eat?

416
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,480
your favorite big banana

417
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,040
It's really not pretending

418
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,880
brother

419
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,320
You can't really

420
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
It's because of this game

421
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,360
You promise, brother

422
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,320
You must get better soon

423
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,920
Did you hear that?

424
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,960
Even now, brother

425
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,960
Don't have much money on me

426
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,200
But I'm selling the iron

427
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,400
I must collect the medical expenses for you

428
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,800
You believe me

429
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,480
Congratulations on being in the Nineteenth Floor Game

430
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,400
Survival time exceeds twenty hours

431
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,480
Tianji Technology sincerely invites you

432
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,920
Participate in the 19th floor trial signing meeting

433
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,760
Address: No. 188, Tianhe East Road

434
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,720
I haven't settled the score with you yet

435
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,080
Delivered to your door yourself

436
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,480
brother

437
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,360
Now your medical expenses are settled

438
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,680
Leave it to me

439
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,040
spring rain

440
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,600
The inspection report is clear

441
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,720
Not in our body

442
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,000
Things like chips

443
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,840
Then we are

444
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,200
How did you enter the game?

445
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,480
I can't think of this right now

446
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,440
Other possibilities

447
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,160
Maybe we'll get to the signing site

448
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
We can still find something

449
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,880
Quiet

450
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
The result for both of us is the same

451
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,440
Dr. Jia

452
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,520
Isn't that your friend?

453
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,400
We let's go out and talk

454
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:29,960
you are very dependent

455
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,200
That classmate named Chunyu

456
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
The spring rain is strong and brave

457
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,080
Always protecting me

458
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,360
give me a sense of security

459
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm very dependent on her

460
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,680
then you know

461
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,080
Why spring rain

462
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Will be with that boy

463
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,760
Are you very close?

464
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,040
Maybe that boy is also very strong

465
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,520
Not only will it not drag down the spring rain,

466
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,320
On the contrary, they will complement each other

467
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,080
Gao Xuan changes cards

468
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,160
The card will automatically return to

469
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,400
In the hands of people without cards

470
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,520
we just fine

471
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,360
Take advantage of this

472
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,400
So the strong

473
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,360
Willing to be with stronger people

474
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,920
Then the weakest person here is

475
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,680
spring rain

476
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,480
why do you

477
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,360
Locked me in

478
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,160
let me out

479
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,240
so what you mean is

480
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,560
I should become stronger

481
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,440
Rather than drag her down
