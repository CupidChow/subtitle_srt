1
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm just

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,502
I just don't want to disappoint you

3
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,069
Mom

4
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:16,970
I can

5
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:17,504
so many years

6
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,138
i never have

7
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,705
past myself

8
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,539
I have already paid

9
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,107
It cost me a leg

10
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,208
I won't let you again

11
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:22,742
use your dreams

12
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,877
crush another youth

13
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,577
this road

14
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,079
She chose it herself

15
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:42,929
Mom

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,901
sit

17
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,445
You have a classmate

18
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,847
My name is Yang Bawan

19
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,520
right

20
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:09,822
He is my classmate

21
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,991
And we have a good relationship

22
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,560
We are together every day

23
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,460
inseparable

24
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,329
But so what?

25
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,032
Mom

26
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,800
This is not a fencing gym

27
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,569
I haven't practiced fencing for a long time

28
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,237
Do you want something?

29
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,205
Are you taking care of me?

30
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,476
yesterday afternoon

31
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,146
Your classmate named Yang Bawan

32
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,347
Come to the fencing hall

33
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,748
Got a handful in hand

34
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,950
I don’t know which theater troupe I’m from

35
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,017
Borrowed prop sword

36
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,619
It seems

37
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,588
As if he wants to challenge me to a duel

38
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
It seems like something he can do

39
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,327
He was

40
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,928
Even though my whole body is shaking

41
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,997
But still trembling

42
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,031
yelled at me

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,400
Aunt

44
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,469
you did something wrong

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,471
You couldn't be more wrong

46
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,673
I almost lost my sword

47
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,441
on him

48
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,609
Poke a hole and come out

49
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,111
Who knows at this time

50
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,147
He took out this

51
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,400
you are very focused

52
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,404
when laying up

53
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:32,905
very difficult

54
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,442
But you always insist

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,344
never give up

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,581
Just like when you practice swordsmanship

57
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,750
like me

58
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,720
the only difference is you

59
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,555
always smiling

60
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,525
you are happy

61
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,462
Xiaoqin

62
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,265
Mom shouldn't

63
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,368
Force what I love on you

64
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,507
This will only increase your pain

65
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,909
from now on

66
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,050
Just be yourself

67
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,552
Mom

68
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,829
As for your sister

69
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,464
She is still young

70
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,166
Don't know yet

71
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,300
things you love

72
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,401
what exactly

73
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,270
so

74
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,939
She still has to insist on practicing with me

75
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,474
Later

76
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,810
I will let her choose freely

77
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,378
It's a guitar

78
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:46,679
Or fencing

79
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:47,780
real

80
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,883
I'm leaving. I won't send it.

81
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,160
Although you don’t practice sword practice anymore

82
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,396
The school is not far from the fencing gym

83
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,098
You can still come back often

84
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,500
come back

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,835
look at your sister

86
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:11,904
have a look

87
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,905
I know mom

88
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,881
Didn't you ask me to meet?

89
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,115
Where are the people?

90
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,528
What's up

91
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,564
Yang Bawan

92
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,499
Why are you so arrogant?

93
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,634
Who asked you to find my mother?

94
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,036
no no no

95
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:17,470
no no

96
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,005
You, listen to my explanation

97
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,939
Just that day in the cafeteria

98
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,240
It's the day when the seeds germinate

99
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,675
Your sister came to school to find you

100
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,743
She saw us together

101
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,343
She told me

102
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:24,944
Auntie's things

103
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,045
Then I'm worried about you

104
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,779
So I went to find my aunt

105
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,914
Sorry, sorry, Xiaoqin

106
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,347
i shouldn't

107
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,430
Come on, come on, look

108
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:45,698
What are you doing?

109
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:49,836
What are you looking at?

110
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,671
Yang Bawan

111
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,040
thank you

112
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,808
me

113
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,277
thank you too

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,261
Senior Gao

115
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:18,698
Sorry to trouble you

116
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,166
I also asked you to come here specially

117
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,067
It's OK

118
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,235
It's easy

119
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,469
Let me give you a look

120
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,470
Nineteenth floor

121
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,606
Technology that will disrupt the future

122
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,241
unprecedented sense of freedom

123
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,041
Wait a mininute

124
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,845
Unparalleled authentic experience

125
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,649
The most immersive cutting-edge technology

126
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,619
The most thrilling dream trip

127
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,390
Senior Gao

128
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,057
this

129
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,359
It's a new game that just came out recently

130
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,360
Also needed when playing games

131
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,461
Wearing their VR headsets

132
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,428
Everyone is looking forward to it

133
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,203
Don't stop Don't stop

134
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:57,703
what are you doing

135
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,538
Put down your phone

136
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,539
You do it again, you do it again

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,874
It's okay, it's okay, they are

138
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,277
What is this?

139
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,478
Nineteenth floor

140
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,846
The newly released game is so fun

141
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:09,982
Walk

142
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,119
The most thrilling dream trip

143
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:13,586
nice

144
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:15,821
Have a look

145
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,658
As long as you try this

146
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,725
Tianji Technology

147
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,793
virtual reality helmet

148
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,594
can

149
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,762
free download

150
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,829
Nineteen layer application

151
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,464
There is a chance to enter

152
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,066
This transcends traditional

153
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,034
sensory experience

154
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,835
From sight to hearing

155
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,604
Expand to touch and smell

156
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,140
Even to the full range of taste

157
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,474
Shocking journey

158
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,809
ten days later

159
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,044
Nineteenth floor

160
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,845
A full public beta will be launched

161
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,781
an unprecedented

162
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,982
Game feast

163
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,217
Coming soon

164
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:56,562
Lao Gao

165
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,196
Coming

166
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:58,598
This

167
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,432
Where is the spring rain?

168
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,466
I didn't call her

169
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,071
It’s right not to call it Chunyu now

170
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,039
On the surface, spring rain looks like

171
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,040
as if nothing had happened

172
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,675
But because of her father's affairs

173
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,010
I must feel very depressed

174
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,845
At this time

175
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:13,980
We still don’t want to give it to her

176
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:14,747
Added to the congestion

177
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:16,649
Everyone

178
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,884
The game is now fully promoted

179
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,152
Ten more days

180
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,220
Public beta is about to begin

181
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,154
I don’t know when the time comes

182
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:22,989
How many people will there be?

183
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,956
fall into danger

184
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,925
So what should we do now?

185
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,793
In case Yan Mingliang is annoyed,

186
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:28,594
Uncle Chun and his friends inside

187
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,428
will be very dangerous

188
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,864
Otherwise still

189
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,599
Give Uncle Chun a little more time

190
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:34,667
Wait for him to get everyone

191
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,701
After everyone was rescued

192
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,036
We'll call the police immediately

193
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,237
But

194
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,405
Waiting game

195
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,439
when officially released

196
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,440
Uncle Chun hasn’t succeeded yet

197
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,041
what to do

198
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,377
We still have to be there

199
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,244
Before the game is released

200
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,145
rescue them

201
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,781
Do you still remember?

202
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,850
On Yan Mingliang's desk

203
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,550
There is a picture frame

204
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,385
Inside the photo frame

205
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,086
is a picture of a young girl

206
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,826
Didn't expect that

207
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,229
Can you still come here like this?

208
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,865
If you say this

209
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,500
I seem to have an impression

210
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,068
It should be his daughter

211
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,436
This morning

212
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,470
I checked online

213
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,072
I found this video

214
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,042

00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,510

Don't crowd, don't crowd

225
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,515
I've scanned it too

226
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,083

227
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:57,717
Okay, no problem

228
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,618
Wait a minute. I'll give you one.

229
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,753
OK thank you

230
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:02,822
you are not that

231
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,489

00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,323
Get me one quickly

233
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,525
Wait a moment, wait a moment

234
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,960
Everyone has it. Don’t worry.

235
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,227
Come

236
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,903
Why are you here again?

237
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:19,705
Dear player

238
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,207

239
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,742
We also have various scenarios

240
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,943

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,318
Is there a shadow puppet ghost house?

246
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,486
sorry

247
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,920

What about the village with leather figurines?

250
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,724
Sacrifice in deserted village

251
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,126

No relevant scenes found

257
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,035
How could this happen?

258
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:10,790
Hello

259
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,824
Let’s find Mr. Yan

260
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,125
Do you have an appointment?

261
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,394
I still have to trouble you

262
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,428
Tell Mr. Yan

263
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,197
The visitors are Gao Xuan and the others

264
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,198
There is something very important

265
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,032
I need to discuss it with him

266
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry

267
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,368
If you don’t make an appointment in advance

268
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,136
Mr. Yan will not meet guests temporarily.

269
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:24,870

270
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,638

273
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:30,843

00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,478
open the door

275
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:45,791
Hello Mr. Yan

276
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,060
Didn't expect that

277
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,329
You will still come to me

278
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,299
Why is there one person missing?

279
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,500
Where is the spring rain?

280
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,402
Chunyu has other things to do

281
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:57,469
A few of us

282
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,470
I want to talk to you first

283
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,540
I know what you want to say

284
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,242
But sorry

285
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,643
rules are rules

286
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,278
I won't release

287
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,246
anyone's

288
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:14,787
Mr. Yan

289
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,156
I remember you said before

290
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,991
You do nineteen layers

291
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,726
because I want to create a

292
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,461
A world full of thrills and excitement

293
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,363
A timeless work

294
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,164
right?

295
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,199
Of course

296
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,636
But that's not your real purpose

297
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,037
Am I right?

298
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,076
what do you want to say

299
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,578
Maybe you are a

300
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,679
excellent businessman

301
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,915
But you may not

302
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,384
is a qualified father

303
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,155
this

304
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,658
It’s the legendary dark ghost building

305
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,028
As expected, the atmosphere is very eerie.

306
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:06,839
i do feel

307
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,807
There is a chilly atmosphere

308
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,909
Refreshing to the core

309
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,422
tell the truth

310
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,757
In my heart now

311
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,792
Really a little nervous

312
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,360
However

313
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,996
I'm Qiqi kid, I'm not afraid

314
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,346
Just a piece

315
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,881
Just rotten wood

316
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:50,616
Qiqi is not afraid

317
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,217
Come on Qiqi

318
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,399
Let's move on

319
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,542
The person I'm waiting for

320
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,543
Not online yet

321
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:20,779
never mind

322
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,648
Let me challenge myself first

323
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,224
etc

324
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,158
I'm going to climb

325
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,193
Go up to that beam

326
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:38,664
Don't let go

327
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,300
Don't let go

328
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,538
now that

329
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,407
you all know

330
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,876
What else is there to say?

331
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,179
I just want to punish them

332
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,582
Let everyone have a taste

333
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,017
The feeling of fear and helplessness

334
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:02,921
Here it is

335
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,690
It’s the corridor of micro-technology

336
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,225
Want to see the office

337
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:06,792
OK

338
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,594
Here it is

339
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,396
my dad's office

340
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:11,764
okay, I get it

341
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:12,698
Come

342
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,033
Qiqi

343
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,101
Can't take pictures

344
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,238
Can't take pictures

345
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,305
Can't shoot Can't shoot

346
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,073
See you in the evening

347
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,108
Qiqi

348
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,677
I have a meeting soon

349
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,513
Just take a look around yourself

350
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,380
Remember

351
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,049
Can't take photos

352
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,183
Can't take video

353
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,952
Everything here is confidential

354
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,823
Then watch my live broadcast if you have time?

355
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,724
Very interesting

356
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,325
Okay, I'll watch it when I have time

357
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,127
Starts on time at 9pm

358
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:42,661
good

359
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,065
Dad, wait a minute

360
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:47,599
What's up

361
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:48,901
Let's take a group photo

362
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:49,802
good

363
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,307
Come

364
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,009
three

365
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:57,743
two

366
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,644
one

367
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,379
eggplant

368
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:31,877
Mr. Yan

369
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,378
Mr. Yan

370
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,246
Mr. Yan

371
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,983
Don't panic

372
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:38,817
problem occurs

373
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,600
That day Qiqi

374
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,603
Under the stimulation and instigation of those people

375
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,872
Went towards

376
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,507
Broken beams on the roof of the ghost building

377
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,113
Look

378
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,115
Didn't I come up?

379
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,559
OK

380
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,060
Then I'll show you

381
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,929
How brave is Qiqi's little devil?

382
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,220
Plasma is quite realistic

383
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,088
The anchors are really working hard now.

384
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,423
family members

385
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,359
Doesn't look like acting

386
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,061
Are you really hurt?

387
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,569
I originally thought he was a good-looking anchor

388
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,836
What are you doing at night?

389
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,537
What bad luck

390
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,805
This is not plasma

391
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,076
I

392
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,878
real

393
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:14,980
Very uncomfortable

394
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,549
Please help me

395
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,984
This wave is awesome

396
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,919
Working hard for the list

397
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,588
I said

398
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,022
Do you want to call 120?

399
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,557
help me

400
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,926
The current female anchor

401
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,861
There really is everyone

402
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,199
Come on, big brother, let’s celebrate the carnival

403
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,601
Dance again

404
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,739
But these people

405
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:42,908
these bastards

406
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,343
Everyone is watching the joke

407
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,045
No one went to save her

408
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,016
my daughter's blood

409
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,219
It's gone like this

410
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,957
All those who are desperate

411
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,592
All deserve to die

412
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,828
everyone

413
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,565
all must be punished

414
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:07,799
No

415
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,901
Not quite

416
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,437
Later I checked

417
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,939
everything that happened

418
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,275
In fact, there are netizens

419
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,342
Called the police

420
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,778
The ambulance encountered

421
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,313
very serious congestion

422
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:22,581
doctors and nurses

423
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,549
They got off the car and ran forward

424
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,118
There is also a nurse

425
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,419
she was hit by a car

426
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,987
But still moving forward with pain

427
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,088
There is another boy

428
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,423
He's on his classmate's cell phone

429
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,424
saw it all

430
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,259
He immediately went to Building No. 19

431
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,427
Go save your daughter

432
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,697
But did he save my daughter?

433
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,807
They are too late

434
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,676
But they all tried their best

435
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:54,346
Mr. Yan

436
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,382
The world is not insensitive

437
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,551
There are still many good people

438
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,421
please let go

439
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,523
Don't be afraid of some darkness

440
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,191
Just punish the whole world

441
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,028
pity

442
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,497
too little light

443
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,635
I must sweep away the darkness

444
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,137
all

445
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:25,677
see off guests

446
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,353
please

447
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,387
Everyone

448
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:41,827
Walk

449
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:04,816
Qiqi

450
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,087
believe dad

451
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:11,990
Dad must let them

452
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,024
pay the price

453
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,477
Lao Gao

454
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:37,983
What's wrong, Xiaoqin?

455
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:42,888
Lao Gao

456
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,489
what should we do now

457
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,057
What else can be done

458
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:47,959
Let's go back to the game together

459
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,428
Put Uncle Chun and other partners

460
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,061
Save them all

461
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:50,929
no

462
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,063
How many of you

463
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,064
Just removed the chip

464
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,065
Just out of danger

465
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,167
Can't take any more risks

466
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:57,903
Lao Gao

467
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,638
This time I stand on Xiaoqin

468
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,006
Since Uncle Chun

469
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:01,907
You can take risks for us

470
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:02,707
why can't we

471
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,042
Take a risk for someone else?

472
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,246
agree

473
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,082
Anyway you go

474
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:12,417
I'll go

475
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:23,662
good

476
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,565
We broke out from the storm

477
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:27,866
no longer

478
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,501
We were just entering the storm

479
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,484
Hello

480
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,084
Annual total

481
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,286
grandma

482
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,022
Xiaoyu, are you back?

483
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:51,623
Take a look quickly

484
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,991
Look at these two words

485
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,125
Are they exactly the same?

486
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:54,860
This trace

487
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:01,800
Today

488
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,201
received a courier

489
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,170
It's from Master Lin.

490
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,472
He's the chef at your school

491
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,342
In addition to these fruits and vegetables

492
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,409
This is the letter

493
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,546
You said he has been missing for so long?

494
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,714
A sudden letter came

495
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,849
The key is to let Master Lin

496
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,817
For transfer

497
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,318
Do you want to ask Master Lin?

498
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,520
What's going on?

499
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,394
Master Lin

500
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,030
Master Lin

501
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,600
He may not understand either

502
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,602
It's really just a transfer

503
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,271
Grandma, don't worry

504
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,639
No rush

505
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,507
If you're not in a hurry, you're a fool.

506
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:43,875
Anyway

507
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,210
That's your dad

508
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:45,944
is not it

509
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,280
Take a look first

510
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,081
Let’s talk about what to write in the letter

511
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,150
Look

512
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:56,955
Hurry up

513
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,000
What did you write?

514
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,271
It's OK

515
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,840
Don't worry. Look.

516
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,241
It's OK

517
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,208
It's okay

518
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,443
It's okay

519
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:20,845
that me

520
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,180
I'm going back to school first

521
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,181
I have something else to do over there

522
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,382
Just wait a moment. Wait a moment.

523
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,355
It's raining

524
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:31,823
This is Master Lin

525
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,558
Dumplings made two days ago

526
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,560
I cooked it for you

527
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:36,595
bring

528
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:41,766
It's raining

529
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,904
these years

530
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,639
No matter what you do

531
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,708
Grandma never said that

532
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,743
Because grandma knows

533
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,680
You act cautiously and appropriately

534
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,484
actually

535
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,754
Grandma doesn’t want anything

536
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,459
I just want you to be safe

537
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,634
that

538
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,169
No matter what happens

539
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,038
What hurdles

540
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,209
Must eat, eat

541
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:48,867
spring rain

542
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,536
Good news

543
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,340
Dad writes this letter

544
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,709
just want to tell you

545
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,279
Dad remembers everything about you

546
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,516
Also remember everything about your mother

547
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,019
Me and your mother

548
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,354
first day of acquaintance

549
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,724
It was me who finished the report on stage

550
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,260
Your mother came over to interview me.

551
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,397
I was so nervous

552
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,400
On the contrary, it made her laugh.

553
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,437
That's my life

554
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,038
The most beautiful smile I have ever seen

555
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:30,842
later

556
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,711
We fell in love

557
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,346
then get married

558
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,049
Then there was you

559
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,820
I remember the day you were born

560
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,823
I hug you happily

561
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,525
Seven pounds and six ounces

562
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,562
I remember the first time you used your hands

563
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,963
grab my thumb

564
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,698
hold on tight

565
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,233
i remember you

566
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,768
Call me daddy for the first time

567
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,038
Tears blur my face

568
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,408
Dad remembers all these

569
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,379
But dad is a stupid dad

570
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,083
I can't express my love

571
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,718
I don't even know how to balance

572
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,587
work and family

573
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,657
So this leads to

574
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,466
this morning

575
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,502
I went to see your mother

576
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,038
I put these little by little

577
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,007
Tell her everything

578
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:37,909
but she

579
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,113
But she can't hear it anymore

580
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,320
Dad's life

581
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,422
Too much time wasted

582
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,559
And also because of dad’s job

583
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,461
In the end it hurts you again

584
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,631
even your friends

585
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:02,967
do not worry

586
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,670
Dad will definitely rescue Qingyou

587
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,838
With Brother Qiang and the others

588
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,141
I will definitely succeed

589
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,111
Because daddy still wants to stay with you

590
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:13,945
Go to college

591
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,247
Attend your graduation ceremony

592
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,949
Saw you looking for a job

593
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,350
fall in love

594
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,519
And then on your wedding day

595
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,489
I want to hold you personally

596
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,992
Put you in his hands

597
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:29,761
but

598
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:31,963
child

599
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,366
Even if dad doesn’t succeed

600
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,038
no matter what happened

601
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,874
You have to be alone

602
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,544
you are the smartest

603
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,646
The cutest

604
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,315
The bravest

605
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:51,950
The gentlest

606
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,319
The strongest child

607
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,023
You are daddy’s favorite person

608
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,282
dad

609
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:58,983
dad

610
00:31:59,117 --> 00:31:59,951
I want to pack this

611
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,324
good

612
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,927
Make a lucky dumpling for Chunyu

613
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,861
Come

614
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,163
I'm watching your bag, don't try to cheat

615
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,164
No cheating look

616
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,769
The person who eats the lucky dumpling

617
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,471
All your wishes will surely come true

618
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:00,805
Coming

619
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:01,672
Annual total

620
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,075
spring rain

621
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,410
Do you want

622
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,045
Give him a few more days

623
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,712
wait and see

624
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,115
I can't wait any longer

625
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,216
He is my dad

626
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,154
Okay, let's go in and talk.

627
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,075
Why are you all here?

628
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,045
we all decided

629
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,513
Let's go back to the 19th floor with you

630
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,748
Help Uncle Chun rescue everyone

631
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:27,992
no

632
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,360
this matter

633
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,728
It started because of my dad

634
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,463
you are all victims

635
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,499
I can't take any more risks

636
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,235
Yan Mingliang is the culprit

637
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,237
Uncle Chun

638
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,605
I also want to stop him

639
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,839
He is also a victim

640
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,108
but

641
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:44,876
spring rain

642
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:45,743
Just stop it

643
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,711
Just say us

644
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:47,545
Is he a good partner?

645
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,579
Are they teammates?

646
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:49,714
Yes, Chunyu

647
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,048
we are best partners

648
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:51,849
best teammate

649
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:52,783
Roll up your sleeves and work harder

650
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,484
That's it

651
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,019
Chunyu, don’t forget

652
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,120
I'm in the game

653
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,088
But what about a warrior?

654
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,222
You can't live without me

655
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,665
Thank you thank you all

656
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:10,668
alright

657
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,837
Now that the decision has been made

658
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,105
let's get started

659
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,044
Currently released by Tianji

660
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,245
New virtual reality headsets

661
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:22,914
Corresponding

662
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,682
Just experience the scene

663
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,517
What about the real game?

664
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,085
There will be a public beta in nine days

665
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,120
will start

666
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,355
so

667
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,523
Now you can only pass

668
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,624
Your previous helmet

669
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,960
Entering the real nineteenth floor

670
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,197
I'm injecting it into you now

671
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,464
Just the day before yesterday

672
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,466
The chip I just took out for you

673
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,636
Let me ask you one last time

674
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:47,838
Are you sure

675
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,840
Do you want to enter the nineteenth floor?

676
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,450
Get in position

677
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:05,623
one thing

678
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,457
I want to tell everyone

679
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,125
Where are we?

680
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,560
Can't enter the background

681
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,762
Helmets can only help you

682
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,563
Enter the game

683
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,065
And I'm outside

684
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,600
Nothing can help you

685
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,167
Annual total

686
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,868
You have helped us a lot

687
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,071
We are all familiar with it

688
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,505
Just proceed as planned

689
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:24,809
good

690
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,010
After entering

691
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,911
Find a way to find

692
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,179
The entrance to the ultimate space

693
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,313
Although I am outside

694
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,147
Can't help you

695
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,916
But I still like the helmet

696
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,517
Made some improvements

697
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,086
if you are inside

698
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,087
What situation did you encounter?

699
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,290
As long as it's in the back of the head

700
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:39,991
click it once

701
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,926
You can exit the game directly

702
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:42,927
back to reality

703
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:44,862
Everyone

704
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,163
are you ready
