1
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,163
What to do Chunyu

2
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,267
I beg you, don't look for me

3
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,068
please

4
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:17,837
Brother Qiang

5
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,566
Go quickly

6
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:47,634
Go quickly

7
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,003
Go, go, go

8
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,278
This way

9
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,245
The roads are blocked

10
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,282
Quick, quick, back, back

11
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,151
Open, open

12
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,120
No

13
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:10,557
Get up quickly

14
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:10,857
quick

15
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,968
Come with me, everyone, hurry up

16
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:22,635
good

17
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,005
Run quickly

18
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:26,873
Run quickly Run quickly

19
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:27,674
Brother Qiang

20
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:00,807
brother

21
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,609
You seem to be interested in this place

22
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,643
Looks very familiar

23
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,078
I arrived before you

24
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,145
Definitely more familiar with the terrain

25
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,513
Don't know you

26
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,281
Have you noticed

27
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,582
On the back wall of the first floor

28
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,017
In fact, there is half a map

29
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,885
That map is only half of it

30
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,153
What can you see?

31
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,856
That half of the map

32
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,224
This is the structural diagram of this building

33
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,360
Those cabinets

34
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,594
You prepared it in advance

35
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:22,662
if not

36
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,797
This way

37
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:29,769
come in

38
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,537
A Yong come in

39
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:32,905
Quick

40
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,675
Close the door, close the door, close the door

41
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:46,919
spring rain

42
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,521
what is this place

43
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,123
Why is it so scary?

44
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,596
It seems we were in a car accident

45
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,365
Even went to the hospital

46
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,305
What do you think this place is?

47
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,848
I've actually been thinking about it too

48
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:16,683
this question

49
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,018
I think there are two possibilities

50
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,286
first one

51
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,188
This is not the real world

52
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:23,856
Right, right, right

53
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,625
Brother Qiang said the same thing

54
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,826
I'm sorry

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,628
not the real world

56
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,562
what do you mean

57
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,898
Alien space or parallel universe

58
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,466
It seems like we are here

59
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,434
everyday world

60
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,001
is the same

61
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,002
But it's completely different

62
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,070
What do you think?

63
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,938
Those shadow puppet monsters just now

64
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,006
in real life

65
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,074
is impossible to exist

66
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,308
Right, right, right

67
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,443
That's what Brother Qiang said

68
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,945
This is too incredible

69
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,180
I do not believe

70
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,381
What about the second kind?

71
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:49,782
The second kind

72
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,818
This is still the real world

73
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,753
There could be a prank here

74
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,388
Those shadow puppets might be

75
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,623
some special device magic

76
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,758
Or a deception

77
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,993
Hei Er usually likes these

78
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,395
He follows several bloggers

79
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,396
It's all magic

80
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,297
Then say so

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,398
Your friend named Hei Er

82
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,966
Might also be involved in this farce

83
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,434
What do you mean?

84
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,836
Hei Er is actually fine

85
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,270
You were just scaring us.

86
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,405
It's possible

87
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:13,206
impossible

88
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,742
i saw

89
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,710
People are really dead

90
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,781
Hei Er can't be real

91
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,184
Don't listen to her

92
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,486
Believe me brother

93
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,720
Hei Er is absolutely fine

94
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,122
whether it's the real world

95
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,490
Or an alien space?

96
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,859
The key is us

97
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,826
How did you get here?

98
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,262
A few of us are because

99
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,563
Got into a car accident and was in the hospital

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,564
And you

101
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,404
I'm not in the hospital

102
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,539
I'm in my dormitory

103
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,509
before coming here

104
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,543
what are you doing

105
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,345
fell asleep

106
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,514
I've been here since I woke up.

107
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,250
You are very suspicious

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,284
you want to say

109
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,352
This is a prank

110
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,154
I think it’s not He Er who did the trick.

111
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,188
It's you

112
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,506
What is this

113
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,308
Go over and have a look

114
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,258
six bags

115
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,760
six of us

116
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,831
Do you still remember?

117
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,432
The numbers above the elevator button

118
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,467
Also nineteen

119
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,168
If this is a

120
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,303
real world words

121
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:51,604
That

122
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:52,905
This must be a

123
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,507
organized and planned behavior

124
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,008
Then this nineteen might be

125
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,243
codename of an organization

126
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,311
He took advantage of us sleeping

127
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,278
lead us here

128
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,379
organized a

129
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,114
Battle royale

130
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,019
Then there should be no surveillance here?

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,387
Someone is watching us, right?

132
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:10,957
But it seems here

133
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,325
There is no camera

134
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,660
Let's take a look at what's inside first.

135
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,528
right

136
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,129
Six bags, one for each person

137
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,346
spring rain

138
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,382
It seems like it's of no use to me.

139
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,983
It seems like nothing to me

140
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,184
elder brother

141
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:12,952
Take them all first

142
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:13,519
map

143
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,123
Everyone

144
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,257
in our bag

145
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,158
every thing

146
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,426
They should all be useful

147
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,628
So we can only work together

148
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,963
Only then can you escape from here

149
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:26,632
right

150
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,901
I think you are right

151
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,670
we are a team now

152
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,204
We need to pay attention to helping each other

153
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,506
Resource sharing

154
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,240
right

155
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:35,841
Of course

156
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,144
What do you think?

157
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,583
OK

158
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,751
Your map

159
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,921
Can I also take a look?

160
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,423
Can

161
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,927
Trade yours with me

162
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,497
It's also okay

163
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,500
But I have two things here

164
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:02,802
Otherwise, let's do this

165
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,636
You pick one

166
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,104
I put it behind

167
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,872
I have one in each hand

168
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,074
You choose

169
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,141
Fair enough

170
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:10,643
fair

171
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,079
Chunyu, be careful he cheats

172
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,080
OK

173
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:15,481
Come on then

174
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,353
Left or right hand

175
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:21,420
Choose

176
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,378
left hand

177
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,547
Take out your things

178
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,089
You must have changed hands

179
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:26,786
spring rain

180
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:27,887
what to do

181
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,188
They took the map away

182
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,389
How do we get out?

183
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,528
So you've discovered it a long time ago

184
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,195
The role of light

185
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,263
right

186
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,022
so

187
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,457
Shadow puppets are afraid of light

188
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,637
What does light do?

189
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,073
I think Chunyu should be

190
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,207
Already knew it just now

191
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,009
He will do things behind his back

192
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,844
No matter which hand you choose

193
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,146
He will leave an ax behind

194
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:01,947
So before you

195
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,648
You should have discovered it

196
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,183
Light can deal with those shadow puppet monsters

197
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,484
That's right, right?

198
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,786
But our map

199
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,620
They were all taken away by him

200
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,555
Is it useful to just know how to deal with shadow puppets?

201
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,323
We still can't get out

202
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,759
That half of the map just now

203
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,194
Same as the half in the hall

204
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,996
Just enough to make a whole piece

205
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:18,898
I think Chunyu should be

206
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:19,899
Already memorized it

207
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,000
That's why I exchanged it with him

208
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,802
Really

209
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,716
This is the complete map

210
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:39,985
all mouth

211
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,187
All are closed

212
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:42,922
Also a possibility

213
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,423
There is no exit

214
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,592
A and B

215
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,760
what place

216
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,795
Electrical control room

217
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,432
Can light up the whole building

218
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,669
All the shadow puppet monsters like this

219
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,603
They can all be immobilized

220
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,671
What a good idea

221
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,274
You have a flashlight and I have a candle

222
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,909
Let's split up

223
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,845
I go to A and you go to B

224
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,112
good

225
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:12,918
spring rain

226
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,320
I'll go with you

227
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,722
It may not be convenient if there are many people

228
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,356
This way

229
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,357
It's safer here

230
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,391
Just let's go

231
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,497
spring rain

232
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:26,999
Please pay attention to your safety

233
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,001
You take this

234
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,472
Let's go

235
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,080
I still don't understand this.

236
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,865
What kind of glass is this?

237
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,367
Even an ax can't split it.

238
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,301
elder brother

239
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,869
What to do about this and this?

240
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,804
Can’t you get out now?

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,884
Read these two words to me

242
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:19,985
Read it out

243
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,719
exit

244
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,357
So what does that mean?

245
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,195
this is not

246
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,398
You mean it's locked?

247
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,634
What about this?

248
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,002
Don't worry, I'll take another look

249
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,363
Quiet

250
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,008
uncle

251
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,843
They've been gone for so long

252
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,045
Why hasn't there been any movement?

253
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:26,845
Won't come back either

254
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,049
They were gone less than five minutes

255
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,583
Don't be anxious, little girl

256
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,819
But I'm worried about Chunyu

257
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,588
She has candles and is not afraid

258
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,200
Has the spring rain returned?

259
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:54,940
spring rain

260
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,576
Is it you Chunyu

261
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,184
spring rain

262
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,219
You speak

263
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,223
spring rain

264
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,367
matches

265
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:23,702
matches matches

266
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,110
girl

267
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,911
matches matches

268
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,409
young man

269
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,979
What did you find?

270
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,547
Is there an electrical control room?

271
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,115
Not yet, uncle

272
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,217
I just saw a shadow puppet

273
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,185
Coming from your side

274
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,153
I'm worried

275
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:14,987
Come and see you

276
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,089
Fortunately you came

277
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,724
Otherwise, this girl and I

278
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,825
But it's miserable

279
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,401
I was on my way here just now

280
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,503
See those shadow puppets on the wall

281
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,504
All have come alive

282
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,206
The situation is very dangerous now

283
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,674
What about the spring rain?

284
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,343
Will Chunyu be okay?

285
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,712
Hope she's okay

286
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,847
No, don't chase me again

287
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,948
Help

288
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,917
Help

289
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:49,955
Go, go, go

290
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,689
elder brother

291
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,357
Look at the shadow puppets

292
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,112
brother

293
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,481
What do you mean

294
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,116
We just need to go to the electronic control room

295
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,917
turn on the switch

296
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,019
All these lights will be on, right?

297
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:22,921
That

298
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,489
After the lights are on

299
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,024
Those shadow puppet monsters

300
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,025
Everything will turn into shadow puppets

301
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:27,993
We can escape

302
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:28,460
right

303
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
You can go out now

304
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,297
you two

305
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,198
There are weapons and maps

306
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,233
Fight your own way

307
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:34,866
Isn’t it over?

308
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,667
don't follow us

309
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,201
no

310
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,603
There are five of us now

311
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,670
a whole team

312
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,671
We need to pay attention to

313
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,606
Teamwork

314
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,473
When robbing something

315
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:41,807
why don't you say

316
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,407
Teamwork

317
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,950
They may not play with us

318
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,752
We have to figure it out ourselves

319
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,288
Then let's go

320
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,956
Go where to go

321
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,058
Give it to them to eat

322
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,994
Flashlight, idiot

323
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,197
Wouldn't it be better to do this?

324
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,765
Isn't it fair to them?

325
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:08,867
You want to be a bad guy

326
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,002
Or be a dead person

327
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,671
listen to me

328
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,640
You'll go there later

329
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,540
Get that kid under control

330
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,409
Then I grabbed his flashlight

331
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,378
Then it's done

332
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,458
Back

333
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,226
Be careful with the ax

334
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,260
Give me something

335
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,261
give me

336
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,364
Brother Qiang, why don’t you come?

337
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,666
I'm on it

338
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,235
It’s just that the objects are different

339
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:45,704
Back

340
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,511
Come bro

341
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:53,779
make a deal

342
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,347
OK

343
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,683
321: Release them at the same time

344
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,818
What I want is your flashlight

345
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:00,686
Who will replace you?

346
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:01,753
bring it here

347
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,155
Don't move

348
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:04,890
Don't move

349
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,124
I can give you the flashlight

350
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,660
But you have to keep the ax

351
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:10,829
good

352
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,364
Bring me the flashlight

353
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,265
I'll give you my ax

354
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,700
I call 321

355
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,702
We throw it to each other at the same time

356
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:17,736
How is it

357
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:20,505
good

358
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:26,845
three

359
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,146
two

360
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,316
one

361
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:34,953
I really can't believe it

362
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,755
Brother, you are not trustworthy either.

363
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:39,991
Then don't blame me

364
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:40,859
Don't move

365
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm coming I'm coming

366
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,428
I'll come

367
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,030
give me

368
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,177
elder brother

369
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:03,849
ax

370
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,183
ax

371
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,490
elder brother

372
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:12,791
elder brother

373
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:13,525
Ayong

374
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:14,993
brother

375
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,729
Let's make a deal now

376
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:18,430
How is it

377
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,298
flashlight

378
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,834
bring it

379
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,538
elder brother

380
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,277
Sorry bro

381
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:33,845
sorry

382
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:34,746
elder brother

383
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,981
elder brother

384
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,023
Are you okay?

385
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,458
so-called brotherhood

386
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,627
Are they just taking advantage of each other?

387
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,562
Such a big brother on the stall

388
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,863
He has no choice

389
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,299
brother

390
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,700
take care of yourself

391
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,603
Uncle, go this way

392
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,265
Damn it

393
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,200
Don't shout

394
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:29,367
Keep your voice down

395
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,002
elder brother

396
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,671
Why are you back?

397
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:33,738
Nonsense

398
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:34,806
I'll definitely come back

399
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,041
Do you think I am Zhang Tianqiang?

400
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,209
Will be the one who betrays his friends

401
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,177
Walk

402
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,046
I knew it

403
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,514
elder brother

404
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,950
Don't hug me, it's hot

405
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,787
Did you see

406
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,389
This wave of courage and strategy

407
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,358
Got it

408
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,260
Brother, take you out now

409
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,096
good

410
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,698
do not worry

411
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,767
Even if I die, I won't let you die

412
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,236
Walk

413
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,392
matches

414
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,260
matches

415
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,016
spring rain

416
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:26,818
It's you

417
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:36,328
Next

418
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,362
There will only be more and more shadow puppets

419
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,863
Let's go to an electrical control room

420
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,232
Let's go

421
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,362
elder brother

422
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:11,930
why do we

423
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,864
It keeps going in circles

424
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,432
do you know

425
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,867
Where is the door to the electrical control room?

426
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:17,602
why we

427
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,870
I keep looking for the electrical control room.

428
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,039
We're not closing the floodgates

429
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,440
Then turn on the lights in the whole building?

430
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,274
Then what if it happens to me

431
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,075
Found the exit?

432
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,443
If you just go out, it will be over.

433
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,678
But the exit on the map

434
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,746
All locked up

435
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,581
If it says it's locked, it's locked.

436
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:30,949
I lied to you

437
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:32,817
That's right

438
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:44,963
Power distribution room

439
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,836
Walk

440
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,716
Why are there so many electric switches here?

441
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:06,951
It doesn’t matter

442
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,353
Let's pull them up one by one

443
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:13,591
Walk

444
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:37,882
found it

445
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,151
found it

446
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,288
good

447
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,089
good

448
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,158
Power distribution room

449
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:48,960
By our two brothers

450
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:50,595
found it

451
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,665
When I go out, I will take you to wash your feet.

452
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,399
good

453
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:55,467
But brother

454
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,869
Hand, the flashlight is almost out of power

455
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:04,609
What are you afraid of?

456
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:05,977
Your brother, let me wait for a while

457
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:06,945
Put all the lights in here

458
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,846
open all

459
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,047
good

460
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,462
If this doesn't light up yet

461
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,230
What should I do?

462
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,072
Why aren't the lights on yet?

463
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,740
Describe the switch that controls the light

464
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,275
Maybe in another electrical control room

465
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,721
Close the door

466
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,522
Close the door, close the door, close the door

467
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,196
Don't be afraid

468
00:29:58,863 --> 00:29:59,564
Brother is here

469
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:00,832
don't worry

470
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,432
good

471
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,004
elder brother

472
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,848
get something get something

473
00:30:58,957 --> 00:30:59,557
spring rain

474
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,226
This candle is almost burnt out

475
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:01,993
What should I do?

476
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,596
This is not the way to go.

477
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,402
Could it be another electrical control room?

478
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,004
spring rain

479
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,706
Is the real switch

480
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,874
In another electrical control room?

481
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:22,513
elder brother

482
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,649
elder brother

483
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,084
Hurry up

484
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,118
found it

485
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,019
found it

486
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:28,987
found it

487
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:30,955
I'll come

488
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,763
As long as we have hope in our hearts

489
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,400
It will definitely work

490
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,436
see the light

491
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:53,945
electric fan

492
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,713
Quick, block the wind, quick

493
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,117
What the hell is this?

494
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,118
Are you going to kill us?

495
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,086
I see

496
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:03,721
It's Brother Qiang

497
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,056
They must have gone

498
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:05,924
Another electrical control room

499
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:06,724
Turned on the switch

500
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,660
But, only the fan is on

501
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,594
What's the use? Chunyu

502
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:10,962
That's so useful

503
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,664
If we talk about the fan switch

504
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:13,498
at their place

505
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,366
That means the light switch

506
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,501
Might still be here with us

507
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,869
You have to look carefully

508
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,471
Walk

509
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,341
Must not be destroyed

510
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,031
found it

511
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,071
Still no response

512
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,408
no fuse

513
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,010
Not necessarily a fuse

514
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,478
Can be metal wire

515
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:01,779
As long as the circuit can be connected

516
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,513
I'll try and find it

517
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:02,947
good

518
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,024
The power of darkness is too powerful

519
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,760
And we are too weak

520
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:24,502
Coming

521
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,103
elder brother

522
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,304
Coming, coming, coming

523
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,405
Help, brother

524
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,306
Hurry up

525
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,507
Shine it, shine it, don't come here

526
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:30,675
Shadow puppets are coming

527
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,080
Don't come here

528
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,482
Don't come here

529
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,552
The candle is almost burnt out

530
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:42,320
Uncle Lin

531
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,554
Take the matches out of my pocket quickly

532
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,222
matches matches

533
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,023
hold on hold on hold on

534
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:45,757
Hold on

535
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:50,395
matches

536
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,829
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick

537
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,113
found it

538
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,082
look

539
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,083
That's it

540
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,422
Go away, go away

541
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:43,548
Hurry up Hurry up

542
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:54,992
You come and I go
