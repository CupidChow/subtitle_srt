1
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
But don't go

2
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,880
We will never know the truth

3
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,560
Miss Chunyu Mr. Gao Xuan

4
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,160
hello

5
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,080
Been waiting for a long time

6
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,040
you know us

7
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,480
Information about contracted players

8
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
I received it early in the morning

9
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
You two, please come with me

10
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,000
This way

11
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Come here please

12
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,120
You two, please take a short rest here.

13
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
Drinks and desserts in the buffet area

14
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Please enjoy

15
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Please follow later

16
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,480
Guidance for staff

17
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
Enter the signing room to sign the contract

18
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You should have discovered it too, right?

20
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,560
Game content in the promotional video

21
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,840
The version we actually experienced

22
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
completely different

23
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,600
Like the version we played

24
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
Beautified version

25
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,920
And the general signing meeting

26
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Usually it's done with great fanfare

27
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,800
This signing will be very low-key

28
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,320
Hello you two

29
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
Please take a look at our brochure first

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,440
Why did you come in anyway?

31
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,160
Hello

32
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
no real content

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,720
What's wrong, Chunyu?

34
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,720
It's OK

35
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,280
Hello you two

36
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
You two, please come with me

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,360
please

38
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,960
Because it involves company secrets

39
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Before I ask you two to enter the cubicle,

40
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,920
put the phone

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Put it in the small basket at the door

42
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
come please

43
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,360
Please take a seat, both of you

44
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,880
Two people in our game

45
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,720
Under comprehensive evaluation

46
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
The ranking is relatively high

47
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,800
I didn’t expect that we were still friends in private.

48
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,200
As a good friend in the game

49
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
In fact, it is very advantageous

50
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm sorry

51
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
Let's make a long story short

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,760
let us come over

53
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,840
Is it to sign a contract?

54
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,960
Yes

55
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,320
How long have you been alive in the game?

56
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
more than twenty hours

57
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
got to be us

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
Opportunities to sign up as experience officers

59
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,720
As a contract experience officer

60
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,280
You can unlock it in the game

61
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
More exciting levels

62
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,200
One more thing is great

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
Players who cleared the level

64
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
can get a sum

65
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,360
generous bonus

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,760
Who wants your bullshit bonus?

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,880
I want my brother

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
Sir, don't be impulsive

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
We have something to discuss

70
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
It’s easy to discuss something

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Does what you say work?

72
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
Call your leader over

73
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,360
I've already told our manager

74
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
The manager said he would be there soon

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,440
please calm down

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,160
back off

77
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,600
Manager Zhang

78
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
good good good

79
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Mr. Zhang Tianqiang, right?

80
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm the manager here

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,880
My name is Zhang Yunfeng

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,880
What are your demands?

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,120
You can tell me

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
Let me ask you something

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,040
What does your company do?

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,960
What a bullshit game

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,000
Dead in the game

88
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Reality will also be comatose

89
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,000
right

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
Where did you hear this rumor?

91
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
You don’t care where I heard it

92
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
Besides, this is not a rumor.

93
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,440
Let me tell you

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,840
My request today is very simple

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
First put my brother

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,600
Hei Er, give it back to me

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,640
then take my brother

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,520
Wake up A Yong

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,080
Then give us three brothers

100
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,000
a compensation payment

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,600
You two can rest assured

102
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,240
we are one

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,400
A very disciplined company

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,480
If there is no problem with the agreement

105
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,400
Just two of you, please

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Signed this player agreement

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,960
Let's go next

108
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,360
I have a question

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,920
please speak

110
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
People who died in the game

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,800
what will happen

112
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
There won't be anything

113
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
Just log out and exit

114
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,800
Disqualified as a player

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,640
Those players just now

116
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,720
This is also the case

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,760
It's just that they think

118
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,760
The game is very exciting

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,840
Still want to come

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,640
Trying to get a chance to play again

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,240
Then why do some people

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,280
die in game

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,200
in reality

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
I'll be unconscious forever

125
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,840
it never happened to us

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,640
this situation

127
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,760
Will it

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,000
is caused by other reasons

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,400
you know

130
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
If the game causes coma

131
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,080
We called it quits long ago

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,000
I won't continue testing at all.

133
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,960
What about Hei Er?

134
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
where is he

135
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,240
I tell you

136
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
You can't do this

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
Today you

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,600
telephone

139
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,640
Hello

140
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
Hey Brother Qiang

141
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,920
Black Er

142
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,360
Hello

143
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
you where have you been

144
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,520
Lost your phone in the hospital

145
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,080
You don’t want it anymore

146
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
Bought a new mobile phone

147
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
That crap is useless

148
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,000
I just threw it away

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
I knew it

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,920
Then where are you now

151
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,520
In Linshui

152
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
What are you doing in Linshui?

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,480
I've done something wrong recently

154
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Come out and hide for a few days

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,840
I want to tell you

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
But when I left that day

157
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Look at you two sleeping soundly

158
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,360
I can't wake up no matter how I scream.

159
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,320
What a bullshit emergency

160
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,200
You go out now

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,160
Don't even say hello to me anymore

162
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Can't talk about this

163
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:31,960
and

164
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,040
You should also keep it a secret from my brother first.

165
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,760
I'll hide for a few more days

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,160
I'll talk to you in detail when I get back.

167
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,160
Your brother has fallen ill

168
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,800
He is now

169
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm busy first

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,920
Bye bye bye bye

171
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,760
Hey Hey hey

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,600
This brat

173
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,840
This is so urgent every time

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,040
Mr. Zhang Tianqiang

175
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,720
Put the knife down first

176
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
Let's talk slowly, okay

177
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
You can't solve the problem like this

178
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,040
So does he

179
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,600
Lost player status

180
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,840
As for where he is

181
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,800
Just ask your friends

182
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,600
Zhang Tianqiang

183
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,120
That's Brother Qiang

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
He should know better

185
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,280
In the game at the same time as Hei Er

186
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,960
The person who died is

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,440
Him

188
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,440
He is our engineer Xiao Li

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
He is in all players

190
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
when the game starts

191
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
Play a role for only three seconds

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,040
The tragic character who just went offline

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,480
That is for everyone

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,760
It just increases the sense of crisis

195
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,920
By the way, he's outside

196
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
How about I ask him to come in?

197
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Verify what I said

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,640
No, I've seen it

199
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,520
As for what you heard

200
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,760
That person is with our company

201
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,400
Somewhat festive

202
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
That's why he said that

203
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,000
In fact, this matter is very simple

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,360
Wait two days

205
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,640
As soon as A Yong wakes up

206
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
You can know it all

207
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,320
It has nothing to do with our game anymore

208
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,880
A Qiang

209
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,200
Lao Lin, why are you here?

210
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,080
Okay, you two

211
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,200
we can talk

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,040
Signing details are up

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,680
good

214
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,360
please follow me

215
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
be smart

216
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,760
Don't be so honest

217
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Signed the contract

218
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,480
Wait a moment

219
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Because it involves company secrets

220
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
please before entering

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Put your phone in this little basket

222
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Thank you for your cooperation

223
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
If there is no problem

224
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
Just two of you, please

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,720
Sign this

226
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,440
Sorry

227
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,640
I have a question

228
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
How did we get in?

229
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,440
of this game

230
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,600
Try on your helmet

231
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,280
at the beginning

232
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
The system records

233
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
your player status

234
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,320
Time to start the game

235
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
will automatically enter

236
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Automatically enter

237
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,040
When we enter the game

238
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
not wearing a helmet

239
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,680
Yes

240
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,240
This is our latest technology

241
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,760
Let the players do it

242
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
Completely immersive experience

243
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,360
so

244
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,640
No need to wear a helmet after that

245
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,200
can

246
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
Entered the game smoothly

247
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
latest technology

248
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
What's the principle?

249
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,080
If according to what you just said

250
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
This technology is difficult to implement now

251
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,400
You said it's hard to do

252
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
but not impossible

253
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,760
this is us

254
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,480
What makes this game unique

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Our R&D team

256
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
Overcame technical bottlenecks

257
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
completed this

258
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,640
Works that span the ages

259
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,560
As internal beta experience officers, you

260
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,920
He also witnessed it with us

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
The birth of this work

262
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,040
Of course

263
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Specific technical methods

264
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,400
It’s our company’s patent

265
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,800
This is to be kept secret

266
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,120
But as a player

267
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
Just enjoy it

268
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,000
The game is exciting on it

269
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,040
What if we don't sign?

270
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,400
I sign

271
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,240
why not sign

272
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,680
don't think about it again

273
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,360
After all, this game is quite difficult.

274
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,640
I don't care about the difficulty of this game

275
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,840
I just want to know

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
When can I get this?

277
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,680
Do not worry

278
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,080
As long as you pass the level, you will be given a bonus

279
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,640
That's right. I told you earlier.

280
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,880
Just this contract

281
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,320
Then I don't have it

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,080
Yes, this is company policy

283
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,080
Then let me take another look at your contract.

284
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,120
good

285
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,560
Just look at it

286
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,840
That handsome guy

287
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,280
Go get me a glass of water

288
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,240
good

289
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,880
Of course

290
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
this is your right

291
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,160
But I still sincerely hope

292
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,800
Think about it again

293
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,840
I think you are usually

294
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
He must be playing games

295
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,520
Must know

296
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
what does this game mean

297
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,600
how wonderful it is

298
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,520
its experience

299
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,400
Are these

300
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,160
Can't it attract you?

301
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,280
our staff

302
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Everyone has seen the video Chunyu

303
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,400
your reaction in the game

304
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,800
your sense of timing

305
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,680
your wit and courage

306
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,560
All proved

307
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,080
You are the best for this game

308
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,320
Don't you think

309
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
You are on the nineteenth floor

310
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,920
Can you realize your greater self?

311
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,160
Besides, you can still get it by clearing customs

312
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,160
a generous bonus

313
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
Thank you. I won’t sign.

314
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,720
I won't sign either

315
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,080
What about your gaming experience?

316
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,040
That's the end

317
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Very sorry

318
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Quiet

319
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
spring rain

320
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,080
why are you here

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm here to sign a contract

322
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
you signed

323
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
Ms. Qingyou

324
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,480
Have you considered it?

325
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,080
To sign or not to sign

326
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,880
So the strong

327
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
Willing to be with stronger people

328
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,120
so what you mean is

329
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,240
I should become stronger

330
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Rather than drag her down

331
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,720
I want to become stronger

332
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
to be her only one

333
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,640
best friend

334
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,840
No need to think about it

335
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,120
I sign

336
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,720
Walk

337
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,720
what are you doing

338
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,960
Bring back the agreement

339
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,000
This game is so dangerous

340
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,920
Don’t you know? You can’t sign

341
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,800
Let go

342
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,560
Let go

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,600
It's my own choice

344
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I make the decision myself

345
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,960
The friendship between these women

346
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Just so plastic

347
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,360
Can't say that

348
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,440
What's up

349
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,200
I sign

350
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,720
good

351
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,880
Come

352
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,600
This is a killing two birds with one stone

353
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,880
Can play games again

354
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
Can you still get a bonus?

355
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,320
I also sign

356
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,000
actually

357
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
You didn't need to sign just now

358
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
Then you don’t need to sign it.

359
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm not doing it for Qingyou either

360
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,680
I just want to know

361
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,560
the truth behind

362
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,760
Me too

363
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,080
Who makes me curious?

364
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,760
It's raining

365
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,800
grandma

366
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,800
I wanted to ask when will you come back?

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,480
Prepared today

368
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
But it’s all what you like to eat

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,360
Let me show off to you

370
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,360
Look, look

371
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,640
This

372
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,840
Grandma, I'm sorry

373
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,560
I forgot

374
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,360
I have something going on here

375
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,640
I won’t go back now

376
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
You, what's going on?

377
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,520
Are you doing this for grandma again?

378
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,680
Whose car are you sitting in?

379
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,480
I'm in the taxi

380
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,080
Grandma, if I really have something to do, I will

381
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Xiaoyu can’t do it anymore

382
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,880
No more, Xiaoyu

383
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,680
grandma

384
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,240
It's raining

385
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,840
grandma

386
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,200
Master, let's turn around

387
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Shannan Road

388
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,680
master

389
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,800
How soon can we arrive?

390
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Can be there in five minutes

391
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,680
grandma

392
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Just tell me

393
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
Are you surprised?

394
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,360
Hello grandma

395
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,960
It's raining

396
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
You have such a short time

397
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,400
You have a boyfriend

398
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,360
It works

399
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,000
grandma

400
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,360
Just be fine with your health

401
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,880
good

402
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,360
If there's nothing else to do, we'll leave first

403
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,360
what did you say

404
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,120
What does it mean to come early?

405
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,080
It's better to come by chance

406
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,680
Grandma has just prepared the meal

407
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
You guys are here

408
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
What the Greedy Cat said

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Just you two

410
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,280
Slow down, grandma

411
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,720
Come on, come on, sit down, sit down

412
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,080
Okay, come, sit, sit, sit

413
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Even your grandma doesn’t know how to do it

414
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,560
What to cook

415
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,440
Just make do with it.

416
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
It looks delicious at first glance

417
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
Really good at talking

418
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Everyone has come

419
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,800
Have a meal with your grandma

420
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
It won't take too long

421
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
You said you were standing there

422
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,000
What are you still doing?

423
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,760
Don't hurry up yet

424
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,840
Bring those bowls and chopsticks

425
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,600
Go, go

426
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,680
Really

427
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,840
Come, come, sit down

428
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,800
Come, come, come

429
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,320
good

430
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,840
Child, what is your name?

431
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,880
Grandma, my name is Gao Xuan

432
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm in Chunyu's class

433
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
Substitute teacher for computer class

434
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,160
Just call me Xiao Gao

435
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,840
Senior Xiao Gao

436
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,440
Xiao Gao

437
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,440
That soup is almost ready

438
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
I'll go take a look

439
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,280
OK

440
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
You sit down first. You sit down first. Okay.

441
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,160
light rain light rain

442
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,320
Let me tell you

443
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm looking at this kid so well

444
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,160
If you like it

445
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,360
Grandma, I will use both hands

446
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,560
support support support

447
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
What are you still dawdling about there?

448
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,120
You go there quickly

449
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,760
Waiting there

450
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,320
How embarrassing you say

451
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
It's been a few days

452
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,600
Lao Yang’s decoration style

453
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,360
I can't chase you back

454
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,040
You three brothers

455
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,960
Forget about getting paid

456
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,440
I said

457
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,400
Yang, let me tell you

458
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,720
No matter what happens today

459
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,440
Please pay me back the money

460
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,440
Did you hear that?

461
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,640
No, no

462
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,120
This old Yang is so scary

463
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I was beaten out like that last time

464
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
It's so shameless

465
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,200
Come on, Hachijo

466
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,240
Hang up

467
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,080
Come on, whose turn is it?

468
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,160
Gojo

469
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,240
no

470
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,120
Take a long-term approach

471
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,040
get rich

472
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,840
Have you made a fortune?

473
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,520
Change one to seven cakes

474
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,680
bump

475
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,920
Quick, quick, wait a moment

476
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,960
Get a bottle of mineral water

477
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
three pieces

478
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,200
come across

479
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,000
Twenty thousand

480
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,400
dad

481
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,320
Your kid doesn't go to school

482
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,920
What are you doing in my store?

483
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,400
Dad, today is Sunday

484
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,000
Is it Sunday today?

485
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,840
yes

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,480
Really?

487
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,640
Sunday

488
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,120
You go home and play on Sunday

489
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,120
Don't hang around here

490
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,760
Let's go back

491
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,400
dad

492
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,120
Will you pay me my living expenses for this past week?

493
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,880
Eighty thousand

494
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,680
and

495
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,640
Card 80,000

496
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm playing mahjong here

497
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
What money do you want?

498
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,240
You don’t know that playing mahjong costs money

499
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,160
Am I on target?

500
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,400
No, you are afraid of me

501
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
I won’t give you living expenses

502
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,600
and you

503
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,360
Go home and wait

504
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,800
I'll touch a few of them in a while

505
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,480
I'll go back

506
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,400
Go and disappear

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,720
It's actually his father

508
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,000
God help me

509
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,120
Don't be angry

510
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,680
The same to you

511
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,080
Transfer an account via WeChat and Alipay

512
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,760
Isn’t it over?

513
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,760
Let the kids run for a while

514
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,760
That's all nonsense.

515
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,440
I do not need

516
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,720
Yang Bawan

517
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,040
Big brother

518
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,240
why are you here

519
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
What's wrong? What's wrong?

520
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,240
Brother, slow down, slow down

521
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
How did you find this place?

522
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,880
There's no place I don't know

523
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Slow down

524
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,040
What's up

525
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
I tell you

526
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,000
From now on you every night

527
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,920
will be dragged into one

528
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,400
In a game called Nineteenth Floor

529
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,880
Can't escape

530
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,960
Of course

531
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,480
I still want to see her

532
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,120
Who are you meeting?

533
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,720
No, what are you having fun with?

534
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,760
Don't you think it's dangerous?

535
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,680
Yes, yes, it's quite exciting.

536
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,280
Are you irritating?

537
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,080
What a fool

538
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,560
I'm afraid you don't know

539
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,400
You died in the game

540
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,920
What will happen to you in reality?

541
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
In reality, this is offline

542
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,480
will become a vegetative state

543
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
Lying in the hospital

544
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,280
I can't move, I can only breathe

545
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,000
You do not believe

546
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,160
Brother, let me lend you a photo.

547
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,840
Embarrass this silly Baitian

548
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,480
This money counts both of us

549
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
We want to come back together

550
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,480
look

551
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
This is my brother Ayong

552
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,440
He was on the previous level

553
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,880
He died in this game

554
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,360
Still lying in the hospital now

555
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
Comatose

556
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,360
If you don’t believe what I say

557
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,680
You can ask Chunyu

558
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
How could this happen?

559
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,320
they all know

560
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,840
No wonder

561
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,400
At that time they had been

562
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,480
remind me to be careful

563
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,160
I won't talk nonsense to you anymore

564
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,040
Your dad owes me money

565
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,400
I want you to help me

566
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,000
OK OK

567
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,320
He is at the mahjong parlor

568
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,560
Let me help you call him

569
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,720
I said I want your help

570
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,680
Do you want your help like this?

571
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,560
What if I can't help you?

572
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,520
Then I'm in the game

573
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,400
kill you

574
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
If you're done eating, then take it away.

575
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,200
Grandma will make you a pot of tea

576
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,760
Grandma, let me help you

577
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,000
No need, no need, iron it, iron it

578
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,760
hot

579
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
Grandma, I'm coming

580
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,080
sit down

581
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,960
good

582
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,400
grandma

583
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
When Chunyu was a child

584
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,600
Smiling so happily

585
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
do you think

586
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,400
Our family Xiaoyu

587
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,400
That character is a bit weird

588
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
No, Chunyu is pretty good.

589
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,800
That's good

590
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,960
That was what she called it when she was little

591
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,440
A good one

592
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,880
Enthusiastic and generous

593
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
So sensible

594
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,120
My name is Chunyu and you?

595
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
Laughing every day

596
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,880
Laughing every day

597
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,320
i have seen her

598
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
what did you say

599
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,440
No I said

600
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,240
Chunyu is doing well now

601
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,960
Actually

602
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
She looks like this now

603
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,600
When she was eleven years old

604
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,800
It has something to do with the car accident

605
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,760
That car accident happened that year

606
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
She hurt her head

607
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,280
Plus during that car accident

608
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
Her mother is gone

609
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,160
This incident greatly stimulated her

610
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
since then

611
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,360
I never dare to follow her again

612
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,840
Mention things from childhood

613
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,280
Afraid of irritating her

614
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,400
So that's it

615
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,560
Also blames her father

616
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,040
This unsatisfactory thing

617
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,840
You said mom is gone?

618
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
Dad doesn't care about her yet

619
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,960
It won’t be another two or three months

620
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
No more living expenses

621
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Even her college tuition

622
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,520
Not even given

623
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,240
What a shame

624
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,760
Right

625
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
I still have to call her dad.

626
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,560
good

627
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,640
You, sit down first, okay

628
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
When my daughter goes to college, no one shows up.

629
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,320
This dad did it

630
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,000
What's wrong, Chunyu?

631
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,520
Why is Tianji's pen here?

632
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,200
grandma

633
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,720
grandma

634
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,680
Where did this come from?

635
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,680
This is what I give you

636
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,080
I saw it when I was cleaning the room.

637
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,280
it's out of water

638
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,120
I feel useless

639
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,120
I just threw it away

640
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
Grandma, please sit down first

641
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
Is something wrong?

642
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
Someone has entered my room

643
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,080
who would do this

644
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,760
Why?

645
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,880
This one looks familiar

646
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,280
Except Tianji

647
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,280
Where else have I seen

648
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,800
It was Dr. Jia who took me there

649
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,160
He sat in his office for a while

650
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,840
Dr. Jia

651
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,800
Dr. Jia

652
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,280
My doctor during the car accident

653
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,680
He also has this pen with him

654
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,200
boss

655
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,600
not found

656
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
Information about him

657
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,600
come back

658
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,720
good

659
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,080
Your illness is not serious

660
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,160
The order has been opened

661
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
Remember to take medicine on time

662
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,640
Come here every month for a review

663
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,600
ok ok

664
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Thank you Dr. Jia

665
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,760
Dr. Jia

666
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Please come to the nurse's station with me

667
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,040
good

668
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,640
a neurosurgeon

669
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,360
What does it have to do with Tianji Neng?

670
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,040
Even if there is

671
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,280
But they

672
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,360
Why put a doctor?

673
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,000
Here it is

674
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,840
Could it be said

675
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,720
Player is unconscious

676
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,160
It really has something to do with Tianji

677
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,760
They need a doctor to help

678
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,280
Only then can we get over this matter

679
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,160
master

680
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,880
Don't stop yet

681
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,920
I've already opened the order

682
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,760
Take medicine on time

683
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,760
Every month

684
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,640
Come and review

685
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,920
i exposed

686
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,280
knew

687
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,560
Finish it as soon as possible

688
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,720
behind that

689
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,000
Do not worry

690
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,600
I have arrangements

691
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,800
You should rest for a while first

692
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,080
Classmate, what are you doing?

693
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,360
This is a girls dormitory

694
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:04,880
Aunt

695
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,920
I'm in a hurry

696
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
Looking for spring rain and tranquility

697
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,720
Can you call them for me?

698
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,800
Find someone

699
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,800
Why don't you call someone first?

700
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,080
I hit

701
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,720
She didn't answer anyone

702
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,520
One is turned off

703
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Which room is it in?

704
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,640
which which

705
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Which major

706
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,040
Security department?

707
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,440
There is a male classmate here

708
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,320
I want to force my way into the girls dormitory

709
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,160
No no no don't don't don't

710
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Auntie, I was wrong. Wrong.

711
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,920
Wrong Wrong

712
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,760
I'm leaving I'm leaving

713
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,680
Play this game with me

714
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,840
You are still a little young

715
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:43,960
Mimi

716
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,440
So good

717
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,160
you know too

718
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,560
I'm good to you

719
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
Just be nice to me

720
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,920
If only I could be stronger

721
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,960
Will she

722
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,120
You can also be nice to me

723
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,920
Quiet

724
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,560
you are here

725
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,840
why are you here

726
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,560
I came to find you

727
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,920
long story short

728
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Do you know who Doudou is?

729
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,000
Doudou in the game

730
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,480
Yes

731
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,080
do you know her

732
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,000
Is she from our school?

733
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,760
Don't know

734
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,720
What are you looking for her for?

735
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Tell her she died in the game

736
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,320
In reality, I will fall into a coma.

737
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,680
who told you

738
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,320
look

739
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,160
You also know

740
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,800
you all know

741
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,960
You just won't tell me

742
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,120
Brother Qiang told me

743
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,040
His good brother Ayong

744
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,680
Isn't it because of this?

745
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,320
Still in the hospital now

746
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,920
Are you unconscious?

747
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,880
So I have to hurry now

748
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,520
Go tell Doudou

749
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,600
Stop playing this game

750
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,840
We should choose the weakest

751
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,600
died in the game

752
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,760
In reality, I will fall into a coma

753
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
let me out

754
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,840
let me out

755
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,920
You don't deserve to be with them

756
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,360
are you okay

757
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,080
Why do you look so bad?

758
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,160
I don't know Doudou

759
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,520
I have something else to do

760
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,520
I go first

761
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,880
No, don't, don't, don't go.

762
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,640
Does Chunyu know her?

763
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,600
Please help me ask

764
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,360
spring rain

765
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,400
so

766
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,440
Me and the injured kitten

767
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,960
Same

768
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,840
They can all be discarded, right?

769
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,680
No
