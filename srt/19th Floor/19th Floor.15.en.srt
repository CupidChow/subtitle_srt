1
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,240
What we just passed was

2
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,880
Logistics Department

3
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
There are some downstairs

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,120
Offices of other departments

5
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
You have too many rooms here, right?

6
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,840
I was a bit dazzled just now

7
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,080
The company is big

8
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,480
The more people in a department, the better

9
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,760
That

10
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
so many rooms

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
Which one belongs to the boss?

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,400
The last room at the end of the corridor upstairs

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,240
What happened?

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,960
no

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm thinking

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,400
can we visit

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,240
this

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm afraid it's not convenient

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,560
Excuse me

20
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,080
That

21
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,480
family members

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,240
Xiaoya is a little tired today

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Otherwise we will broadcast live today

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,080
That's it

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Goodbye babies

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,880
that

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,280
I do think so

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,520
A little tired today

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,320
I didn't know it was inconvenient for you

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
Give us a lounge

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,640
Let's take a break

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
This is no problem

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,800
follow me

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,880
Come

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,040
here

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Then you are here first

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,080
take a break

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,280
Call me if you need anything

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,080
OK

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,360
Then go and do your work first

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,080
Bye-Bye

42
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Bye-Bye

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,760
Mr. Yan

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
All according to your instructions

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
they have come in

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,120
keep an eye on them

47
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,000
Everyone, come to me first

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
But don't go near them

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,280
Everyone, come to me first

50
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,440
But don't go near them

51
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,280
receive

52
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,320
clear

53
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,320
Walk

54
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
What's wrong, Chunyu?

55
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,400
Is it a little too smooth?

56
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
you are jealous

57
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,920
My plan is perfect, right?

58
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,480
Before Xiao Jia leaves

59
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,880
told me a string of numbers

60
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
I have no idea

61
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,320
Is it helpful to you?

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
Is there anyone else?

63
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
spring rain

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
Chunyu, it’s too late

65
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,560
Okay, Chunyu

66
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,520
Stop looking. It's too late.

67
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,400
Go quickly Go

68
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,760
It's this kid

69
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,200
Lao Gao

70
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Why are you here?

71
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Let’s talk after we go out

72
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
Lao Gao, you came just in time.

73
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,120
Are you here to save us?

74
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,480
I think

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
Now that the chip can be removed

76
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,320
Then they are sure

77
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,200
What equipment will there be?

78
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,240
Yes

79
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,080
poisoner

80
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
There must be an antidote

81
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,640
How is it

82
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
What's the gain?

83
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,200
their equipment box

84
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,080
The protection is too strong

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
I didn't hack in

86
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
So the alarm just went off

87
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
It's because of you

88
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,760
So you already knew

89
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,440
we are here

90
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,160
yes

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,440
Eighty thousand in the afternoon

92
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,560
Tell me your plan

93
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,920
I think there are many people

94
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Can distract Tianji's attention

95
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,920
Are you using us as cover?

96
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,400
Then we can also discuss it

97
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
Take action again

98
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,080
We just almost got caught

99
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,960
No No No

100
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Lao Gao, he didn’t mean it either

101
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,160
At most he is

102
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Eager for success

103
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,160
Is it Lao Gao?

104
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,240
of course i know

105
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
He didn't mean it

106
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,840
Then I was cheated

107
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,200
It's okay to just say a few words, right?

108
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
Chunyu, why are you leaving?

109
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,680
let's discuss

110
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
The following plan

111
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Let's discuss it again

112
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
I am real

113
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,120
I don’t want to enter this game anymore

114
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
What are you discussing?

115
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
Just let him decide.

116
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,360
You, aren't you angry?

117
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,880
He treats us as cannon fodder

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,680
A little bit

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
but

120
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,560
I think

121
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,680
He is also for everyone

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,720
you

123
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,240
So angry because

124
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,040
Mission failed

125
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
Or because

126
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,920
I just asked casually

127
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
Check it out

128
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
this young man

129
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
After unlocking the door

130
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,760
Entered the equipment room

131
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
breaking the secret

132
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,600
When storing the box

133
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,400
Alarm triggered

134
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,640
Are any devices missing?

135
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,320
no

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
He ran away after triggering the alarm

137
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,360
but

138
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,600
our system

139
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,880
suffered some damage

140
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,200
To be on the safe side

141
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,400
Needs a complete upgrade

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,440
The entire game system

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
That is to say

144
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,240
Tonight on the 19th floor

145
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
Can't start

146
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,880
sorry

147
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
my fault

148
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,560
Then

149
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
Let them dry overnight

150
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,760
yes

151
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
You, aren't you angry?

152
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
He treats us as cannon fodder

153
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,760
you

154
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,080
So angry because

155
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,640
Mission failed

156
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,480
Or because

157
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,800
Are everyone here?

158
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,600
I didn’t even enter the game last night

159
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,360
What about you?

160
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,360
I didn't get in either

161
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,320
spring rain

162
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
I didn't enter the game last night

163
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,840
I didn't get in either

164
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,120
Why?

165
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,600
Don’t you enter the game every night?

166
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,800
What's going on

167
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Chunyu Xu Wenya

168
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,040
Where are you two?

169
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,280
Enter the game or not?

170
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,000
Who is it? Early in the morning

171
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,960
Are you going to let people sleep?

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,120
Yes, how can I

173
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
I didn't get in either

174
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,040
What's going on

175
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,960
spring rain

176
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,120
spring rain

177
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,480
spring rain

178
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
I didn't last night

179
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,840
both of them

180
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,240
When did the relationship become good?

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,520
We need to go to the bathroom together

182
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,160
I think

183
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,280
Maybe I broke it

184
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,440
When they equipment box

185
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,160
Also for their system

186
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,320
caused some damage

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
say so

188
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Although Lao Gao's action failed

189
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
But there are still some results

190
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,920
if that's the case

191
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
I hope this damages

192
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,000
is permanent

193
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,840
Then we don't have to

194
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,680
Enter the game again

195
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,240
God bless you if that happens

196
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,440
It’s not necessarily because the system is broken.

197
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,720
Just a guess

198
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,600
If the system breaks down

199
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,520
Brother Qiang, Qingyou and the others

200

Right

202
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,520
Who is Doudou in reality?

203
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,120
I want to know too

204
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,520
Where is the spring rain?

205
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
Why haven't you spoken?

206
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,040

Wait until you finish graduate school

Mom

215
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
I have no intention of leaving Jiangning

216
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,520
Tell me about you

217
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
Ever since your dad’s accident

218
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,960
Mom, it’s not easy

219
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,400
I can take you with me

220
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,640
And me

Provide you with the best conditions

223
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
You are begging for nothing

224
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,120
I have to go back to Jiangning

225
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,200
This is better than Jiang Ning

226
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,520
I don’t know how many times better

227
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,600
Mom, I'm not a child anymore

228
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,120
I have my own choice

229
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Gao Xuan

230
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
At that place?

231
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Leave you too much

232
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,200
Bad memories

233
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,240
I couldn't protect you in the past

234
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,320
so

235
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,480

239
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
It has no effect

240
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
The only thing that affects me now

241
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,280
It's a very special concern

242
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,320
Don't urge me to go back

243
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,960
I have my own choice

244
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,520

245
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,280

Okay, okay, mom won’t rush you anymore

247
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,120

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,160
My own body

249
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,920
do you know

250
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,280
OK, don't worry

251
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,120
Bye-Bye

Microtech and these

260
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,080
What does it matter

261
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
There are assembly equipment there

For the left-behind elderly

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
So that’s where we end this lesson.

You didn't even reply

304
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,200
I once thought that between us

305
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Already missed it

306
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,840

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,160
You can come over and show off your skills

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
Thank you, Mr. Nian, for your kindness.

325
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,760
But if you are not in a hurry

326
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,400
I think

327
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,040
Finish the work at hand first

328
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,040

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,280
If you need anything, just ask

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,560
we will definitely

331
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,360
Fully protect your scientific research projects

This year it seems

335
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,000
Developed many new products

336
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I'm quite interested

337
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,280
I don’t know if it’s inconvenient

338
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Go to our R&D center

339
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,960
take a tour

340
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,000
No problem

341
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,720

344
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,280
I'll arrange it

345
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,160
OK

346
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,960
That's troubling you

347
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Why are you so polite?

348
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,120
Nian Zong, please stay.

349
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,960

350
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,040
I'll give it to you

351
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,840

Stop shouting

360
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,680
If you don’t support your children, you won’t give them money.

361
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
You are still acting like a coward now

362
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,520

My son-in-law said he was busy with work

386

Can't take care of children

387

Just leave the child with me

388
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,840
Let's start. It's okay.

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,960
I've been out of work for a while

397
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,960
No

398
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
No, no, no

399
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
It must be him

400
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,960
I don’t want to worry about his daughter anymore

401
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,680
Auntie really

402
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,480
I know him

403
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,560
He has resigned

404
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,440
I don't know where he went

405
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,720
What to do

406
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,480
Why didn't you say you were resigning?

407
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,560
Annual total

408
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm really sorry

409
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Where have people gone?

410
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,360
Where have people gone?

411
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,640
Grandma, please slow down

412
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,080
careful

413
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
grandma

414
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,240
It's raining

415
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,400
You are here too

416
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,920
Light rain

417
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,120
you are here

418
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,200
I want to find your dad today

419
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Get living expenses

420
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
As a result, they live and die

421
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,960
Don't even let me in

422
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
say

423
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Your dad has been out of work for a while

424
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,440
You said your father is the same person?

425
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,360
If you are laid off, then you will be laid off.

426
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,840
What's there?

427
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,240
It took us so long

428
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,320
Can't even find him

429
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,960
grandma

430
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,320
Maybe uncle

431
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
What is the difficulty indeed?

432
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,560
He never said hello every time.

433
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,480
Don't talk about him anymore Don't talk about him anymore

434
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,360
Talking about him makes me upset

435
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,600
Let's go, grandma, go home

436
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,120
Walk

437
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,640
go home

438
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,040
Xiaogao

439
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,560
Walk

440
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,000
Come home with me for dinner

441
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,280
he

442
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,400
Go again

443
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,280
What does it mean to go again?

444
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Are you a stupid girl?

445
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
Thanks to Xiao Gao today

446
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,960
You shouldn’t go home for a meal yet

447
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,840
Thank you

448
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:01,880
Walk

449
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,480
Xiaogao

450
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,560
Don't talk to her and go

451
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,160
Good grandma

452
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,720
go home

453
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,360
Slow down

454
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,600
go home

455
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,200
How

456
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,720
No one has picked up yet

457
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,600
Whatever

458
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,520
you too

459
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,360
Met such a good dad

460
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,160
We don't care about him

461
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,800
We should chat after dinner

462
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
It's time to drink tea

463
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,720
Don't worry about it

464
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,160
no need to bother

465
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,840
You two talk

466
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

467
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,440
Grandma is still so enthusiastic

468
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,520
Is it interesting to chat awkwardly?

469
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,040
spring rain

470
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,720
Actually I'm there too

471
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,640
I do not want to know

472
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,600
You stay for a while

473
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,920
I'll make you a pot of good tea

474
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,040
I'll give you a new tea set

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,280
Where did it go?

476
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,200
I clearly remembered to store it here.

477
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Where did it go?

478
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,680
Look, this is weird

479
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Grandma, you put it here

480
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
Really old and useless

481
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm going to get some air

482
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,360
Look, look, look

483
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:37,920
grandma

484
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,920
I'll go out and see her

485
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Go quickly Go quickly

486
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,400
The scenery is pretty good

487
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,200
how do you know

488
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Where is my tea set?

489
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,480
I wasn't before

490
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,440
Have you been to your home once?

491
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,000
That time I saw my grandma

492
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,640
Put it there

493
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,800
You know

494
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,560
My memory is no worse than yours

495
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,960
Gao Xuan

496
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Seriously

497
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,360
I don't know now

498
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Which of your words is true?

499
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,600
Which sentence is false

500
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,600
I don't know either

501
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,160
How many things are you hiding from me?

502
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
bastard

503
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,800
what are you doing

504
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
As heartless as your mother

505
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,520
If you have the ability, go away

506
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,160
you

507
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,200
My name is Chunyu

508
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,960
And you

509
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,480
It will help you laugh in the future

510
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,800
I

511
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,600
My name is Zhao Lei

512
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,000
spring rain

513
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
I have thought about it countless times

514
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,680
The scene of meeting you again

515
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
But when I saw you at school

516
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,800
but don't know

517
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,680
How to meet

518
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
When we met in the ghost house

519
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,480
you didn't recognize me

520
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,640
I don't know how to speak either

521
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,200
How I hope one day

522
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,720
You can think of me yourself

523
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
But these are not important

524
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,800
no matter what

525
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,360
I will always be by your side

526
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,720
Grandma, please stay

527
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,720
No need to give it away

528
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,280
I have nothing to do. I will go back first.

529
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll see you next time

530
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,840
How much does that fruit cost?

531
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,760
No money, given to you

532
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,480
You need to scan the code, right?

533
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
No, no, no, grandma

534
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,680
I don't know how to do this

535
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,240
Grandma, no need

536
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,760
This

537
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,520
yes

538
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,200
I can't use it

539
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,560
This is my grandson's cell phone

540
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,760
What a day two days ago

541
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Tianqiang brought it to me

542
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,760
grandma

543
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,320
can you give me a look

544
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,120
OK, let’s see

545
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,240
That's right

546
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,880
It's that secret agreement

547
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,360
Whose mobile phone is this?

548
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,080
Black one

549
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,520
I don’t know the specifics either.

550
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,680
It should have been taken by Brother Qiang, right?

551
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,280
Hei Er’s mobile phone

552
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,120
right

553
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,720
Brother Qiang gave me an address

554
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,960
Ask me to take good care of A Yong

555
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
and Heiji's grandma

556
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,640
So today I

557
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,880
I just took a look at her old man

558
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,280
Then just

559
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,320
I didn’t expect Brother Qiang

560
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,360
Still have such a hand?

561
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,200
Nice job

562
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,040
Nonsense, my brother

563
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,640
That

564
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,480
We have an agreement now

565
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,320
There is another video of a player falling into a coma

566
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,400
can we

567
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,560
Went to negotiate with Tianji

568
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
This boss of Tianji

569
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,920
I can't find it online

570
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,840
any information about him

571
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,120
in addition

572
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,720
He is very mysterious

573
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
So what do we do next?

574
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,080
Go, go

575
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
The longer you delay, the more unclear it becomes.

576
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,960
Don't hurry up yet

577
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,120
Hurry up

578
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,480
spring rain

579
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,920
spring rain

580
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,960
yesterday

581
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,200
I thought your actions

582
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
may not succeed

583
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
But I have a high probability

584
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,640
be able to find that device

585
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,160
in addition

586
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,360
I judge the secret

587
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,720
We need to continue this game

588
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,120
So I won’t treat you

589
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,240
what harm is caused

590
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,120
sorry

591
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,360
Sorry Chunyu

592
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,760
I

593
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,280
Shouldn't take advantage of you

594
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,280
We should be of the same mind

595
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,240
spring rain

596
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,440
Why do you talk so much?

597
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,640
Are you going to Tianji?

598
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,680
go

599
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,920
Let's go too

600
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,200
Wait for me

601
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,720
But we

602
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
Why not call him Uncle Lin?

603
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Wait until there is good news

604
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
Let's notify him again

605
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,960
All right

606
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,880
Everyone

607
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,080
Please take a break here

608
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,360
Desserts and drinks are optional

609
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,640
Have you made it clear?

610
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,760
We want to see your boss

611
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,560
your demands

612
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,440
I have already reported it

613
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,520
But the specific arrangements

614
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,480
It doesn’t matter what I said

615
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,440
Then find one

616
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,520
Here comes the person who has the final say

617
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
Someone will arrange it later

618
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,520
How long will it take to wait?

619
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,360
Everyone, please be patient.

620
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,920
All arrangements of our company

621
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,240
All need to go through the process

622
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,000
Meet again

623
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,600
I don’t know everyone

624
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,480
Want to see our boss

625
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,640
What's going on specifically?

626
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,720
Wait till we see him

627
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Of course I will tell him

628
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,040
our boss

629
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,560
There is an important meeting now

630
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,280
The following process is also fully arranged

631
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,280
In fact, you can tell me first

632
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,160
some details

633
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,120
This way I move upward

634
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,880
Reporting will be more efficient

635
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,720
Just say us

636
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
I need to see him in ten minutes

637
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,440
Otherwise we will call the police

638
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,640
I would like to know

639
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,600
The specific content of your report to the police

640
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,320
what is

641
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,840
we have solid evidence

642
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,560
can be proven

643
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,520
Games you develop

644
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,240
Nineteenth floor

645
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,640
extremely high risk

646
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,680
Will cause the player to remain unconscious

647
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
this situation

648
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,600
Can't you call the police yet?

649
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,400
Well

650
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,120
I'll call and ask for instructions

651
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,560
Hello

652
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,440
Please go to the president's office

653
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,280
This is the annual general office

654
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,040
He is still in a meeting

655
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,920
You sit down for a moment

656
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,040
Do you know Nian Yongcheng?

657
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,440
who

658
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,560
General Manager of Micro Technology

659
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,960
I'm in his office

660
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,120
I saw a group photo

661
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,360
the person standing next to him

662
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,200
It's you

663
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,080
You weren't even on the phone

664
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,120
what do you mean

665
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
I want you to find your boss

666
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,680
Keep the change, please

667
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,720
what kind of person

668
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,200
Will talk to the general manager of Micro Technology

669
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,200
Call us brothers

670
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,240
At least his true identity

671
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,840
Not just employees

672
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You guessed it right

673
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,200
The person you are looking for

674
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,040
Actually it's me
