1
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:11,938
it's me

2
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,377
Why did you come in?

3
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:19,946
them

4
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,714
They attacked her

5
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:22,849
Don't let her in

6
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,018
then what should i do

7
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,285
Do you believe in this world?

8
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,187
I do not believe

9
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,390
From the day she left

10
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,891
I only believe in myself

11
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,728
for many people

12
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,363
college admissions

13
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,464
It means life

14
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,932
A new chapter is about to begin

15
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,368
But in my eyes

16
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,970
Everything is boring

17
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,072
for the future

18
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,275
I don't have any expectations

19
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,466
Good morning, babies

20
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,268
starting from today

21
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,803
Xiaoya is a freshman.

22
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:05,905
what

23
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,073
there is one there

24
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:07,940
beautiful lady

25
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,144
This classmate

26
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,445
Are you a freshman too?

27
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,913
Can you talk about Jianghua?

28
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,453
It seems that the classmate just now

29
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,387
a little shy

30
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,488
But it doesn't matter

31
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,556
Don't leave, everyone

32
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,624
Xiaoya's live broadcast room

33
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,259
first day of school

34
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,660
Come and report with Xiaoya

35
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,529
Let’s take a tour of Ganghwa together

36
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,031
You are Xu Wenya

37
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,869
I actually go to the same school as you

38
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,072
My name is Yang Bawan

39
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,139
I'm your fan

40
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,110
I'm in the School of Business Administration

41
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,144
you

42
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,848
What are you majoring in?

43
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,584
I act in film and television

44
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,553
Yes Yes Yes Yes

45
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,821
I know how it's possible

46
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,755
Can I be in the same class as you?

47
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,472
spring rain

48
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,978
That's right, it's Chunyu

49
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:20,980
i have seen her

50
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,916
The most cold-blooded among the seventeen

51
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,951
demon king

52
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:25,952
Although I am in high school

53
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,786
Not with her

54
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,854
but i know her

55
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,555
It is said that she is withdrawn

56
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,390
like violence

57
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,057
Always in the bag

58
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,024
Everyone is equipped with a hammer

59
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,129
So I say you must not

60
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,900
Internet celebrities are just different

61
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,702
time management guru

62
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,043
spring rain

63
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,818
spring rain

64
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:11,891
This is the legendary

65
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,625
That building?

66
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,528
I see a lot on the Internet

67
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,429
About Jianghua College

68
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,597
The legend of the abandoned old building

69
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,666
What to say is spooky and weird

70
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:21,834
And there are

71
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,069
many horror stories

72
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,471
In short, there are various versions

73
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,207
Let's go

74
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,576
By the way, Chunyu

75
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,178
I am also a geriatric health care major.

76
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,846
I didn’t expect that I was in the same class with you in high school.

77
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,248
I'm still in the same class as you in college

78
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:36,983
Really?

79
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,619
spring rain

80
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,053
I just asked the teacher

81
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,054
We share a dormitory

82
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,357
You won't be unhappy, right?

83
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,292
I just think

84
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,994
I feel safe with you

85
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,350
My name is Qingyou

86
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,652
He majors in geriatric health care

87
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,387
That is Chunyu

88
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,821
We are in the same class

89
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,196
A whiteface

90
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,631
A popular singer

91
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,533
They're all clowns

92
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,174
The most cold-blooded among the seventeen

93
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,075
demon king

94
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,010
It is said that she is withdrawn

95
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,011
like violence

96
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:39,745
Always in the bag

97
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,713
Everyone is equipped with a hammer

98
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,153
This is a nice bedroom

99
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,220
Everything has turned into a construction site

100
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,194
you are hurt

101
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,662
let me help you

102
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,366
Need not

103
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,571
If I weren't missing an arm

104
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,472
Broken leg

105
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,540
I'm embarrassed to say it

106
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,541
I used to practice sports

107
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:10,509
Right

108
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,944
My name is Nan Xiaoqin

109
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,012
business administration

110
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,580
My name is Qingyou

111
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,348
Is a senior health care major

112
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,215
No introduction needed

113
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,817
You were making so much noise just now

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,618
I heard it all

115
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:19,652
Sorry

116
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:20,886
It's OK

117
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,893
Where is she going?

118
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:02,888
Quiet

119
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,457
what do you want to do

120
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,659
Don't go in

121
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,195
Quiet

122
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,031
Quiet

123
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,702
Students attending the opening ceremony

124
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:57,369
please note

125
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,971
Please gather and get on the bus immediately

126
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,224
Master Huang

127
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,525
Are you still free?

128
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:20,459
Lao Lin

129
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,493
You really know how to take advantage

130
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,195
You can also take the school bus to buy groceries.

131
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,029
This canteen

132
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,364
Aren’t they not going to reimburse travel expenses?

133
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,565
I'm on my way

134
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,434
I’ll give you more when serving food later.

135
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:29,702
Stop shaking your hands

136
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,169
OK

137
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:30,870
Sit in the back

138
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:02,701
Brother Qiang

139
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,470
We have all withdrawn

140
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,171
Why do you have to go with this guy named Yang?

141
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:06,939
Where's a case of beer?

142
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,009
It's all bullshit

143
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,243
We all came to your door

144
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,111
Don't even pay back the money

145
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,212
This is big brother

146
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,047
I don’t want our trip to be in vain.

147
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,315
You don't understand painstaking efforts

148
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,249
Right, Brother Qiang?

149
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,684
You are so capable

150
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,019
What did you just do?

151
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,287
When Lao Yang copied the guy

152
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,454
You can run away faster than anyone else.

153
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,822
I've never seen you in my life

154
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,690
It went by so fast, really

155
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,324
No, you are stupid

156
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,392
It's wrong for you to talk like that

157
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,494
I call this a tactical retreat.

158
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,795
You say you again

159
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,030
No matter how fast you run

160
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,765
Who can run faster?

161
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,334
Those are my legs

162
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,335
longer than both of you

163
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,203
I'm one step ahead of you, three steps ahead

164
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:39,905
And you drive well for me

165
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,506
Look ahead

166
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:41,974
Look ahead Look ahead

167
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,210
Wait for it from Lao Yang

168
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,011
get the money back

169
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,613
I'm going to get a new phone

170
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,004
mother

171
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,672
mother

172
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,808
classmates

173
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,309
classmates

174
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,344
classmates

175
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,713
mother

176
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,016
mother

177
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,951
mother

178
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,021
mother

179
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,984
spring rain

180
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,388
Where is this?

181
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,206
we

182
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,141
Have you seen it somewhere?

183
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,212
You were the one who got on the bus later

184
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,614
I remembered

185
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,983
You are students of Jianghua

186
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,285
It seems we were in a car accident

187
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,388
Went to the hospital

188
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:14,693
spring rain

189
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,365
elder brother

190
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,300
Are we dead?

191
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,703
Does it hurt?

192
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:25,871
It hurts

193
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,172
It will still hurt if you die

194
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,809
That's right too

195
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:34,646
But I remember

196
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,347
We hit a car

197
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,181
On the bus?

198
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,018
Then this place must be hell, right?

199
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,954
I told you everything

200
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,189
Some of us are alive

201
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,024
Even if we die

202
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,259
We will only go to heaven

203
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,093
Won't go to hell

204
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,729
spring rain

205
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,732
are we dead

206
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,500
Brother Qiang

207
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,536
There are two little girls here

208
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,772
Unexpectedly, on Huangquan Road

209
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,207
There are also beautiful women accompanying you.

210
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,452
You were also in a car accident

211
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,329
We are on the bus

212
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:26,698
elder brother

213
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,633
They were the ones who killed us

214
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,234
You can't talk nonsense

215
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,135
not us not us

216
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,903
I told you we are not dead

217
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,873
Who did this prank?

218
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:35,707
What's wrong

219
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,609
Drag us over to the escape room?

220
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,018
I said what are you doing?

221
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:10,942
You did it

222
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,211
I just pressed it casually

223
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,214
I've been telling you about your bad habits since you were a child

224
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,449
Don't touch around

225
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,550
It's OK

226
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,435
now

227
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,604
You are in dire straits

228
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,873
Hard to fly with wings

229
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,543
Wait until I take your head

230
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,977
Able to escape from death

231
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,412
Idiot's dream

232
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,748
I have thousands of mes

233
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,449
endless life

234
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,951
Kill them all

235
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,854
Let's watch me slay all the demons tonight

236
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,656
Daybreak

237
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:01,893
What did I think?

238
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,727
Pretend to be a ghost

239
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,435
Don't scare me

240
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,369
Don't scare him

241
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,737
What is it?

242
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,805
It's just a shadow puppet show

243
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:14,940
Pretend to be a ghost

244
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,342
Then who is doing it behind the scenes?

245
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:18,944
I'll go take a look at the back

246
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,412
Don't go

247
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,385
Brother Qiang

248
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,222
No one controls it from behind

249
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,854
why are you here

250
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,789
who are you

251
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,091
no time

252
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,125
you can't stay here

253
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,750
spring rain

254
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,261
Kill, kill someone

255
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,429
Killed someone

256
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,331
Black Two Black Two Black Two

257
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,873
Black Er

258
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,377
Black Er

259
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,179
Black Er

260
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,382
Black Er

261
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,387
open the door

262
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:43,788
open the door

263
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,023
Open the door. Open the door.

264
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:45,623
Open the door. Open the door.

265
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,291
open the door

266
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,594
Qingyou this way

267
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,528
Quiet

268
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,229
open the door

269
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,030
spring rain

270
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:58,837
Walk

271
00:28:59,471 --> 00:28:59,771
Walk

272
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,311
This way

273
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,419
Black Er

274
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:15,754
Black Er

275
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:16,788
Black Er

276
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,131
elder brother

277
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,233
elder brother

278
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:22,487
Quiet

279
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,427
Quiet

280
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,868
Is Hei Er really dead?

281
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,705
Probably dead

282
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,344
Hei Er

283
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,645
Shut up

284
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,446
lower your voice

285
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,914
You bring all those monsters over here

286
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:50,648
are you stupid

287
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:51,883
no

288
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,151
Am I dead or alive today?

289
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,285
I want to bring it back to him

290
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,020
You go

291
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,622
The hall in the back is full of monsters

292
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:58,890
You must give them heads

293
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,591
Then go ahead

294
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,025
You want me to give you grandma

295
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,793
Bring back two corpses

296
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,694
Then you go

297
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,631
But I feel really sad

298
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,066
Why do you feel uncomfortable?

299
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,902
All these things are fake

300
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,737
When you wake up from your dream, there is nothing.

301
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:13,471
Otherwise it’s over

302
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,209
But is this really a dream?

303
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,544
i feel it all

304
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,645
It's all real

305
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:21,446
I ask you

306
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,382
you've been in real life before

307
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,017
Have you ever seen these shadow puppet monsters?

308
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,018
No

309
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,086
Maybe Hei Er

310
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,254
He is out now

311
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,488
safer than us

312
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,790
real

313
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,459
Are you looking for your brother?

314
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,193
Hei Er

315
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:36,861
Then what you have to do now

316
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,662
Just shut your mouth

317
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,596
follow me

318
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:39,697
I'll take you to find the exit

319
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,065
Ok

320
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,075
There are windows

321
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,245
Can go out

322
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,749
You won't get stuck on it, will you?

323
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,054
Give it a try

324
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:37,455
OK

325
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,222
try

326
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,691
Looking for a guy

327
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,027
elder brother

328
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,128
This is heavy

329
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:45,863
This can be done

330
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,231
get out of the way

331
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,971
Come again

332
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,973
So strong, come again

333
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,940
Come on, come on brother

334
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,444
Change another one

335
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,615
Why can't this glass be broken?

336
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,787
What kind of glass is this?

337
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,255
Even if you smash it, it won't break.

338
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,125
Uncle Lin

339
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,693
Why didn’t Chunyu follow?

340
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,528
There are too many channels here

341
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,063
Maybe she went astray

342
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,432
Then nothing will happen to her, right?

343
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:22,867
There are so many shadow puppets

344
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,468
All alive again

345
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,335
do not worry

346
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,471
Your classmate is very smart

347
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,473
She will definitely find a way to escape

348
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,575
I also think she's okay

349
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,911
What on earth is this place?

350
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,646
This is too scary, right?

351
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,648
If you ask me, I don’t know either.

352
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:52,864
elder brother

353
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,499
The two of us are like this

354
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,367
You won't attract monsters here, right?

355
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,203
If you can't speak, don't speak.

356
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,705
On the way we just came

357
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,406
where is

358
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:41,846
This way

359
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,549
Run quickly

360
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,085
Brother Qiang

361
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,152
Brother Qiang

362
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,193
Brother Qiang

363
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,261
i was wrong i was wrong
