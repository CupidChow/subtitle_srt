1
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,364
The Nian beast is gone

2
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,765
The shadow puppets are gone too

3
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:46,666
Nian beast

4
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,034
There are also

5
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,002
Something so exciting?

6
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,105
So what should we do now?

7
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,239
Go to next level

8
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,340
Walk

9
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:08,955
The leather figurines are gone too

10
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,258
Go down

11
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,950
no train

12
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,452
No more clowns

13
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:09,716
The bugs are gone too

14
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,195
Be careful

15
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,732
There's nothing here either

16
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,467
No, Lao Gao

17
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,536
What is going on?

18
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,372
The game should be silent now

19
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,874
All mechanisms and monsters

20
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,075
All stopped

21
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,777
So what to do now?

22
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,312
We didn't find the entrance

23
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,079
There is no way

24
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,213
Entering the ultimate space

25
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:20,720
It's a landslide

26
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:21,554
Run away quickly

27
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:27,860
quick

28
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,137
Obviously all games

29
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:38,871
All fell silent

30
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,140
The system may be unstable

31
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,941
accidents caused

32
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,577
But the good news is

33
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:45,778
they should enter

34
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:46,713
The ultimate space

35
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:47,513
But it is best not to

36
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,715
way of death

37
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,116
Nian Zong warned us before

38
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:51,851
It seems we

39
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,119
I can only ask Mr. Nian for help.

40
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,868
Then the only way now

41
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,838
I just want to take you to Tianji

42
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,139
from their host room

43
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,906
Enter the system

44
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,375
Take you directly

45
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,943
Sent to the final level

46
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:17,744
Thank you

47
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,613
But if this is the case

48
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,382
Are you in danger?

49
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:25,818
help you

50
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,421
Just helping my daughter

51
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,656
I'm also helping myself

52
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:48,474
Let's go

53
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:49,976
Let's go

54
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,591
Come in

55
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,330
You said it was this late at night?

56
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,131
Make me hungry

57
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:12,932
Eat something later

58
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:13,733
OK

59
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,935
Go to the same restaurant where we ate last time

60
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,571
That meat in their house?

61
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,039
I think it's very delicious

62
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:20,640
right

63
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,442
I think it's this area nearby

64
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,242
The most delicious

65
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,477
Their ribs are delicious

66
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,579
I miss you if I don’t eat for three days.

67
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,109
Come in

68
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,600
alright

69
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,335
The console here

70
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,436
Permissions are set

71
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,470
I can only help you

72
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,538
Enter the ultimate space

73
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,273
After you go in,

74
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,708
Just act according to circumstances

75
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,876
I will be outside

76
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,910
give you as much as possible

77
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,677
provide support

78
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:32,311
good

79
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,481
Mom, let’s go home now

80
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,416
good

81
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,551
go home

82
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,122
Brother, you have to run

83
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,557
Can you run over there?

84
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,691
You let me be a hero for once

85
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,659
Okay ah

86
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,893
It's a bit cruel to say this

87
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,361
but it's true

88
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,896
Your legs may not recover

89
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,931
Same as before

90
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:25,898
Shout

91
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:26,732
let me out

92
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,433
You shout

93
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,901
Even if you shout till your throat is broken, no one will pay attention to you.

94
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,835
give me the cards

95
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:30,903
elder brother

96
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,471
help me

97
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,840
Dad, it hurts too much

98
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:35,942
Don't hit me again

99
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:36,909
dad

100
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:37,944
bastard

101
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,345
dad

102
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,613
As heartless as your mother

103
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,415
If you have the guts, you can go too.

104
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,588
happy birthday to you

105
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,690
wish you birthday

106
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,293
Yiming, why don’t you sing?

107
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,561
Just today

108
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,798
This project came to an end

109
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,132
Finished

110
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:00,900
dad

111
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,401
Not like this

112
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,236
everything is over

113
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,504
Dad is too busy

114
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,140
He didn't come to your birthday

115
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,675
There must be a reason

116
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,911
Your dad is the world

117
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,179
best dad

118
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,380
he loves you

119
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,812
80,000, are you okay?

120
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,382
Xiaoqin, I feel so uncomfortable

121
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,056
Go and see her

122
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:37,957
Give me 80,000

123
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,093
no

124
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,661
Wenya, are you okay?

125
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,395
The nightmare inside

126
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,597
When will it be the first time?

127
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,297
I'm inside

128
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,465
I have the heart to want to die

129
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,833
Just hold on a little longer

130
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,294
Quiet

131
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,467
are you okay

132
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,334
Quiet

133
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,241
Quiet

134
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,798
It's meal time

135
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,034
Walk

136
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,276
What does this mean?

137
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:15,120
Quiet

138
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,231
What's going on?

139
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,039
Quiet

140
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:34,440
Hurry up

141
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,353
Walk

142
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,573
Brother Qiang

143
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,674
No noise allowed

144
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,143
Brother Qiang

145
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,111
Brother Qiang

146
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,412
It's great to meet you

147
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,580
We're here to save you

148
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,014
Brother Qiang

149
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,181
Brother Qiang

150
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,421
What happened to them

151
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:23,856
Could it be because

152
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:24,990
Stayed here too long

153
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,858
suffer every day

154
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,259
The torture of inner demons and illusions

155
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,061
So my mental state is very bad

156
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,834
Ten minutes for meal time

157
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:39,705
after meal

158
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:40,873
Are we going back to the cell?

159
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,575
The nightmare will continue

160
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,411
This is too tragic, right?

161
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,193
Quiet

162
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:36,962
You eat, I'm not hungry

163
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,276
Uncle Chun should take a while

164
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,277
will come over

165
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,212
don't worry

166
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,121
Senior sister

167
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,657
I did something wrong before

168
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,694
But don't worry

169
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:09,595
this time

170
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,263
We are here to save you

171
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:12,498
Start to open

172
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,232
fantasy

173
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:14,933
No fighting allowed

174
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,502
I didn't fight

175
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,569
I'm not an uncle

176
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,837
I'm very obedient

177
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,140
uncle

178
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:23,842
Senior sister

179
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:24,910
Did you see an uncle?

180
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,878
Got into a fight with someone else

181
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:26,578
No noise allowed

182
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,613
I didn't make any noise

183
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,814
She didn't talk to me either

184
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,882
I don't want to go to the dungeon

185
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:30,916
I'm afraid of going to the dungeon

186
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:31,617
sit back

187
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,227
My dad is in a dungeon

188
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,063
Uncle Chun will not do it without reason

189
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:44,897
Fighting with someone

190
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,131
There should be his purpose

191
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,599
don't worry

192
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,436
Brother Qiang

193
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,336
Brother Qiang

194
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,337
we are not an illusion

195
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,105
we are real

196
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,940
I'm really here to save you, Brother Qiang.

197
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,443
Brother Qiang

198
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,656
I'm going to the dungeon to find my dad.

199
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,628
I go to the control room

200
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,697
Close the fog and open the prison door

201
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,035
Xiaoqin

202
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,106
And me

203
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,424
what are you doing

204
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,093
I hit someone. I hit someone.

205
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:48,961
Chunyu hit someone

206
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,628
The big devil hits someone

207
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,629
The big devil hits someone

208
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,930
Someone is coming

209
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,233
Hitting someone, fighting

210
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:54,800
There was a fight

211
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:55,834
Stop

212
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:57,836
Stop fighting. Stop fighting.

213
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,171
spring rain spring rain spring rain

214
00:18:59,271 --> 00:18:59,972
stop stop

215
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,440
spring rain spring rain

216
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,278
sorry sorry

217
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,479
Don't do it. Don't do it.

218
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:18,557
Don't move

219
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,694
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

220
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,896
Didn't make a move Didn't make a move

221
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,230
Yes, yes, it's all her fault

222
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,298
It has nothing to do with me

223
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,599
Yes, yes, she beat her

224
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,400
she her her

225
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,338
Take him to the dungeon and take him away

226
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,254
Time's up. Go back to the cell.

227
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:07,639
Walk

228
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:10,909
Walk

229
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,562
go in

230
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:46,511
dad

231
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,680
Is that you, dad?

232
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,182
No noise allowed

233
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,257
Dad, are you okay?

234
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,492
spring rain

235
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,130
go in

236
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,754
I still remember you when you were little

237
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,590
I teach you to play chess with the computer

238
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,359
We often think of each other

239
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,593
same trick

240
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:44,429
but

241
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,631
The trick I think about every time

242
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,466
But they are better than you

243
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,433
Of course

244
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,635
Because you are my daughter

245
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,504
Better than blue

246
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,718
sorry

247
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:16,895
dad

248
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,297
I no longer blame you in my heart

249
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,032
I know

250
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,402
you just have to do it

251
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,003
things you have to do

252
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,173
You didn't mean to snub me

253
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,841
and mom

254
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:34,880
Thank you

255
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,223
Right

256
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,025
Why did you come in again?

257
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,396
We called Mr. Nian for help

258
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,464
not only me

259
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,665
And Gao Xuan

260
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,333
80,000 Xiaoqin Wenya

261
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:56,668
we all came in

262
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,837
These stupid kids

263
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,039
Isn't this asking for trouble?

264
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:01,873
dad

265
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,675
We just have to do it

266
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,910
what we have to do

267
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,596
give me the cards

268
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,669
I'm not I didn't mean it

269
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,670
I did not do it on purpose

270
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,072
help me

271
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,912
help me

272
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:57,582
elder brother

273
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,852
Run quickly

274
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,741
dad

275
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,309
Gao Xuan succeeded

276
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,297
Lao Gao succeeded

277
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,236
Why isn't this door open?

278
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:41,840
dad

279
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,474
You came to the dungeon on purpose

280
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:44,342
It's because of here

281
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,310
There is something very important

282
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:45,743
right

283
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,513
Because of this game

284
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,148
The underlying architecture is made by me

285
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:51,616
I was inside

286
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,717
Buried a secret door

287
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,385
Take this as a breakthrough

288
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,186
Implant Trojan

289
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,589
can destroy the entire system

290
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,990
But I didn't expect

291
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,192
Yan Mingliang on my basis

292
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,360
made a lot of changes

293
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,662
I put all the levels on the 19th floor

294
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,797
Almost finished

295
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,498
I didn't find this secret door either.

296
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,701
But the only place you haven't been to

297
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,702
It’s the ultimate space

298
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,469
right

299
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,838
After coming here

300
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,773
Observed carefully

301
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,375
The structure of the entire space

302
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,509
I think

303
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,544
This secret door

304
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,145
Most likely in the dungeon

305
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,180
so

306
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,114
spring rain

307
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,182
Look at it now

308
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,550
Do you have any clues there?

309
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,586
what does it look like

310
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:29,387
very simple

311
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,290
It’s the word rain for spring rain

312
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,387
I don’t know what happened to the 80,000 yuan.

313
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,136
80,000 Are you awake?

314
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,539
this this

315
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,141
Xiaoqin

316
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,477
Finished

317
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,013
Why no response?

318
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,282
Could something really happen?

319
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,153
Eighty thousand Eighty thousand

320
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,655
Knock so hard

321
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,757
Did something happen?

322
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,560
Xiaoqin

323
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:44,896
Smash it so hard

324
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,297
Something really happened

325
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,266
Xiaoqin, don't worry

326
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,334
Lao Gao has already gone to think of a solution

327
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,234
The door will open soon

328
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,035
I'm by your side

329
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,704
Xiaoqin, don’t be afraid

330
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,707
What are you doing?

331
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:58,977
Smashing the wall

332
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,945
Why did you wake up?

333
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,149
Yes, I'm having a nightmare

334
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,718
Help, let me out

335
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,919
Help

336
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:14,692
Something might have happened in the control room

337
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,027
Everyone gathers in the control room

338
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:16,627
yes

339
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:24,402
Walk

340
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:32,944
Something might have happened in the control room

341
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,812
Everyone gathers in the control room
