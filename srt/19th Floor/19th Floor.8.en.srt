1
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,440
The alien space I entered last time

2
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
It’s actually a game

3
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,880
gaming company today

4
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,080
Invite us to sign a contract

5
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
but no explanation

6
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
Why not wearing a helmet?

7
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
Just entered the game

8
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,840
I also checked

9
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,160
There is no chip in the brain

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,080
What do you think it will be?

11
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,720
This should be a

12
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
brain wave interference

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,960
Are you sure there is no chip?

14
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,080
in addition

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,480
The game you are talking about

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,040
Is it the nineteenth floor?

17
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,000
how do you know

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,040
Things on the nineteenth floor

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
what else do you know

20
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,880
The nineteenth floor game is about to begin

21
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,840
no

22
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
I want to save Doudou

23
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
Great, we meet again

24
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,200
no no

25
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,800
I

26
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,640
Me I'm so happy

27
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,440
Doudou

28
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
Doudou, listen to me

29
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,160
This game is very dangerous

30
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,080
if you are in the game

31
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,680
If you die

32
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,400
you are in the real world

33
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,160
Will fall into coma

34
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,960
so wait a moment

35
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,080
You must walk behind me

36
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,320
who told you

37
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
Listen to Brother Qiang

38
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,360
Don’t you all know?

39
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,040
Don't even tell me

40
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
I lied to him

41
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
I also found Hei Er

42
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,000
This Ayong will be fine soon.

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,440
How could it be dangerous?

44
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,520
Talk nonsense

45
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,160
no

46
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,120
Why did you lie to me?

47
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
why should i lie to you

48
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
That's not because your father is too cruel.

49
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,360
Your dad beats me if he doesn't pay back the money he owes.

50
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,400
I won't lie to you twice

51
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,920
can you help me

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
Are you going too far?

53
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,560
Actually lied to me

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
Scared me half to death

55
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,040
Right

56
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,520
why do you keep

57
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,360
Wearing a mask

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
You are not afraid

59
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,320
Be recognized by us

60
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,440
The last one won't be you

61
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
Lock us in, right?

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,520
I watched one two days ago

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,320
Extremely great game

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
virtual reality

65
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Well done

66
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,640
When you get a chance, try it someday

67
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
Wearing it will make you fly

68
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,720
It seems

69
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,280
Last injury in the game

70
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,000
It won't last until this time

71
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,360
who

72
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
Why is it you again?

73
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Nothing to explain

74
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
I didn't lock the door

75
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
Do you believe it or not?

76
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,600
Say it again

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,200
This is the game world

78
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,440
Do I wear a mask?

79
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,680
None of you can care

80
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Doudou

81
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,000
Doudou Doudou

82
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,920
Doudou, don’t be angry

83
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,080
Doudou Doudou No

84
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,760
bean

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,240
What did you say you were doing?

86
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,920
she saved us

87
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,480
why we

88
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Do you still doubt her?

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Why?

90
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:44,960
no

91
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,360
You don’t have to tell us.

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
I don’t know what the difficulties are

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Waiting for us

94
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,560
Uncle Lin Qingyou

95
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,400
Let's go in and have a look

96
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,160
let's go girl

97
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
Let’s see if there are any tools first

98
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,200
It can be used

99
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,120
Doudou

100
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,560
Doudou

101
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,680
Just wait for me, Doudou

102
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,480
Doudou

103
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,440
You wait for me together

104
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,600
Why have you been following me?

105
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Aren't you afraid that I will harm you?

106
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,560
No way

107
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,720
You are my hero

108
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,840
A heroine, not a hero

109
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,720
what

110
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,080
Anyway, you're such a weakling

111
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
Just don't follow me

112
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
hold me back

113
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
I want to beat you

114
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm going to hide until you finish fighting

115
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,760
Doudou

116
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
Let me ask you a question

117
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,400
put

118
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,880
Are you from our school?

119
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,600
no

120
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
I haven’t said which school yet

121
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,320
You knew it wasn't the case

122
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,040
No matter which school I go to

123
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,360
in real life

124
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
I don't even want to know you

125
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't ask me what's my name

126
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,080
I won't tell you

127
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,320
Uncle Lin

128
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,120
You take this

129
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,840
OK

130
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,040
Go to the second floor

131
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,400
go ahead

132
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,960
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

133
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,200
Why is he wearing my clothes?

134
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,240
They are exactly like us

135
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,320
This seems to be

136
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,080
they are conscious

137
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,680
Uncle Lin

138
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,080
Take them away quickly, quickly

139
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,720
Come with me, Qingyou

140
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,200
I do not go

141
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,280
Go, go, go, go, go

142
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,320
quick

143
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,480
Hurry up

144
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,520
Doudou run quickly

145
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,800
go this way

146
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,560
quick

147
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,240
Hurry up

148
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,920
spring rain spring rain spring rain

149
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,680
spring rain

150
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,920
spring rain

151
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,720
I want to stay and help you

152
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
Spring rain opens the door

153
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,840
spring rain spring rain

154
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,360
Walk

155
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,640
Doudou Doudou

156
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,480
OK, make sure there is no tail

157
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,120
Safety

158
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,320
do you think

159
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,960
I can't beat it

160
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,120
no

161
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:30,920
but

162
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
There must be another me

163
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,560
Are you helping it?

164
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Just one more idiot

165
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
Your safety is most important

166
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,160
Run quickly Run quickly

167
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,440
This way

168
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,080
Let's go

169
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,080
Walk

170
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,360
This way

171
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,440
There are only two of us left.

172
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,680
Singled out

173
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,600
duel

174
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Come on

175
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,520
Come on, come on

176
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,120
Worried about the spring rain

177
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
They are together

178
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,120
It's definitely fine. Don't worry.

179
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,160
Of course I'm relieved

180
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,520
She has someone with her now

181
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,440
I am no longer her

182
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,520
best friend

183
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,720
There's a quarrel

184
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,560
no

185
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,600
are you

186
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
Or is it because of what happened last time?

187
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,880
In fact, you may not know

188
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
We were outside at that time

189
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,240
It's really dangerous

190
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,080
Me and that Xiaoqiang

191
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,320
Almost died

192
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,200
Maybe Chunyu thinks you are in a coffin

193
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
Maybe safer

194
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
Then couldn't she say something?

195
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,480
Don't tell me beforehand

196
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,440
It's okay to talk about it later.

197
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,960
I just think

198
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,440
It's because I'm too weak

199
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,840
Always dragging her down

200
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,040
So actually just now

201
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
I want to stay and help her

202
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,040
but i found

203
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,280
She doesn't seem to need me

204
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,640
at her place

205
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,160
I'm like a burden

206
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,920
did you know

207
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
In fact, we were in high school

208
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,440
Just classmates

209
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,560
But she has always been cold

210
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,800
No one cares

211
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,440
There's one minute left before the exam ends

212
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,000
She is very strange

213
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,200
She always turns in blank papers every time she takes an exam

214
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,480
But one day

215
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,720
I picked up her scratch paper

216
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,040
I found above

217
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,160
All are correct answers

218
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,400
That is to say

219
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
She can obviously get full marks in the exam

220
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,880
But he always came last in the exam

221
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,560
penultimate

222
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,200
And this college entrance examination too

223
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,040
you know

224
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,760
Admission scores of Ganghwa College

225
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,560
is the lowest

226
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,320
But she is lower than the lowest score line

227
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,120
Two more points

228
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,280
I don't understand

229
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,920
I always feel

230
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,320
She seems to be wasting

231
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,440
own talent

232
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,320
It's like you're competing with something

233
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,920
in my eyes

234
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
She will always be a mystery

235
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,920
you are hurt

236
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Need to deal with it quickly

237
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,880
It's okay

238
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,400
Just some skin injuries

239
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
Besides, this is in the game

240
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
It's not really hurt

241
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,400
This

242
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,760
But you still feel pain

243
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,360
After I help you deal with it

244
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
Will recover better

245
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
It's okay. It's okay.

246
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't move

247
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
when you were little

248
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,560
Are you often easily injured?

249
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,120
I

250
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,040
I

251
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
Not easily injured

252
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,160
do you know

253
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
I thought of one

254
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,920
childhood friend

255
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
She loved to laugh when she was little

256
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,640
She was also very curious at that time

257
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,120
Still very active

258
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,080
There was one time in my mind

259
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
Let's fly a kite together

260
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,320
The kite string is broken

261
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,080
The kite fell into a tree

262
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,560
She was the first to rush forward

263
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,640
To get that kite

264
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
she climbed into the tree

265
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,040
As a result she fell from the tree

266
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
My leg was broken

267
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,600
You say she is brave?

268
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,640
She's quite afraid of pain

269
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,080
You are not afraid of pain

270
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,840
this game

271
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,440
The experience feels quite real

272
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,680
Why are you following me?

273
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,240
I said are you finished?

274
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,240
Can you stop pulling me?

275
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,000
OK OK

276
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,920
Sorry Sorry

277
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,440
That's it

278
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,840
This way

279
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,880
This time I'll take the lead

280
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,680
Observe their weaknesses carefully

281
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,640
Then wait for an opportunity to take action

282
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,240
Doudou Doudou

283
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,640
sorry sorry

284
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,400
sorry sorry

285
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,000
Sorry Doudou

286
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
I really didn’t mean it this time

287
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,160
It's 80,000

288
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,120
Go fast

289
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,160
Walk

290
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,880
uncle

291
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,680
So she is such a person

292
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,000
I really want to get to know her

293
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,720
get close to her

294
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,280
But it's really hard for her to understand

295
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,840
It's also hard to get close to

296
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,000
I was just thinking

297
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm in her heart

298
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
What location is it?

299
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,960
uncle

300
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,080
Can you understand what I'm saying?

301
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,000
Roughly the same

302
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,640
I still think

303
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,040
You need to communicate more

304
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,480
spring rain

305
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,280
Run quickly

306
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,960
quick

307
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,160
quiet quiet

308
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,640
Brother Qiang

309
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,200
Go this way

310
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:08,920
quick

311
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,040
Quick, quick

312
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,440
Close the door

313
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,800
This is the workshop where leather figurines are made

314
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,760
Push this way

315
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,000
Brother Qiang

316
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,680
get up get up

317
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,560
How strange

318
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Why are there no tasks assigned this time?

319
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,840
That's right. I haven't said anything yet.

320
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,320
Isn’t this a lack of martial ethics?

321
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
The scene today is the same as yesterday

322
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,640
So it’s the same level

323
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,800
If you say entering the elevator

324
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,800
If it is a ceremony

325
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,080
Then we have to enter the elevator again

326
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,400
Only then can you start a new level

327
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,600
spring rain

328
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,760
you mean

329
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,920
When I first entered the elevator

330
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,400
Just confessed

331
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,520
Complete missions

332
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,720
I heard what they said

333
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,680
What sacrifice is completed?

334
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,040
Complete the Deserted Village Festival

335
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,840
What else is there before?

336
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,280
Get rid of evil spirits

337
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Get rid of evil spirits

338
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,040
right

339
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,880
Get rid of evil spirits

340
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,680
Complete the Deserted Village Festival

341
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,200
Those leather figurines outside are evil spirits.

342
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,160
we want them

343
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,960
All wiped out

344
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,840
Then complete another

345
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,400
What? What kind of sacrifice?

346
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,080
Then I passed the test

347
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,400
weapons

348
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,800
Think of it this way

349
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,920
suddenly enlightened

350
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,920
give me one give me one

351
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,120
Big one, come quickly

352
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,600
You are cheerful

353
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
These leather figurines are cruel and fierce

354
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,120
You kill them all

355
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,040
what are you two doing

356
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,680
Come and help quickly

357
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,640
No more, go

358
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,480
What's going on

359
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,640
Are you leaving?

360
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,320
Quiet

361
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,600
spring rain

362
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,120
Big devil, think of a solution quickly

363
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,120
Can't stand it anymore

364
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,680
Go this way

365
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,720
This way, hurry up

366
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Come this way quickly

367
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,200
Where is the spring rain?

368
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,280
Why do you still care about her?

369
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
This is the door here

370
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,880
I we will always

371
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,800
Stay here

372
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,400
what should we do now

373
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
divide and conquer

374
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,480
Defeat each one

375
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,160
figurines

376
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,640
Even a puppet

377
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,520
Drive it with a whistle

378
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,760
Breakable
