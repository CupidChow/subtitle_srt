1
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:30,884
spring rain

2
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:31,985
Don't come here

3
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,089
What's wrong with you

4
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,565
Gao Xuan

5
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,501
I know

6
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,172
You want me to be like before

7
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,742
I was very happy when I was little

8
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,811
i know you like

9
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,446
me at that time

10
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,917
So now I really want to

11
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,019
Live the way you want

12
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,356
during this time

13
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,595
I make myself laugh every day

14
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,433
I want to stay with you well

15
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,073
But I can't laugh now

16
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,541
sorry

17
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:29,609
no

18
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,614
spring rain

19
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,265
Mr. Yan

20
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:53,900
I beg you

21
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,868
Let everyone go

22
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,705
They are so young now

23
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,006
Why should I suffer

24
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,074
Such pain

25
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,645
what qualifications do you have

26
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,579
tell me this

27
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,181
Nian Yongcheng

28
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,416
You turned out to be Chun Yiming’s follower

29
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,551
It's the chance I gave you

30
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,452
Went to the table

31
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:13,653
everything you have now

32
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,754
It's all given by me

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,424
But what did you do

34
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,495
betrayed me

35
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,331
Mr. Yan

36
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,501
Your support for me

37
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,137
I'm always grateful

38
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:31,971
But this

39
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,107
This has to do with this

40
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,575
They are completely two different things.

41
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:36,576
Say it again

42
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,176
Stop talking

43
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,612
They asked for it

44
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,415
You asked for it too

45
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,422
spring rain

46
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,257
spring rain

47
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,495
spring rain

48
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,764
Chunyu I'm sorry

49
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,100
It's all my fault Chunyu

50
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,169
Why is this so?

51
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,138
spring rain

52
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,743
It is my fault

53
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,311
It is my fault

54
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,212
spring rain

55
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,215
It is my fault

56
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:03,930
No

57
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,433
this is not true

58
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:08,968
this is not true

59
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,370
this is not true

60
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,774
this is not true

61
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:16,943
not real

62
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,047
this is not true

63
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,484
this is not true

64
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,753
this is not true

65
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:28,688
this is not true

66
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,613
Nian Yongcheng

67
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,823
Sorry, Mr. Yan

68
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,059
But I have to do it

69
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:27,967
spring rain

70
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,101
spring rain

71
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,236
Chunyu wake up

72
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,337
spring rain

73
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:32,805
wake up

74
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,249
It's okay

75
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,418
It's okay

76
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,225
Come

77
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,178
we just

78
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
Did you enter again?

79
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,447
The nightmare comes back

80
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:16,749
But it's all a dream

81
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,884
Just wake up and it'll be fine

82
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,419
Just wake up and it'll be fine

83
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,388
Just wake up

84
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,803
spring rain

85
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,806
i always wanted you

86
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,074
Change back to the way it was before

87
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,443
But I found I was wrong

88
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,013
That dream just now

89
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:47,913
Let me also understand

90
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,984
No matter what you look like now

91
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,586
i love you all

92
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,225
I will always be by your side

93
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,394
Uncle Chun

94
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,371
Xiaoqin

95
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,907
Let's never quarrel again

96
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,340
OK

97
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,308
There must be a problem with the annual general meeting.

98
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,343
They don't move at all

99
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,854
Yongcheng still gives it to us

100
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,155
Gained time

101
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,491
Now this door

102
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,492
No longer useful

103
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:40,926
the only way

104
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:41,927
Just find the secret door

105
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:43,262
there

106
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,497
I can also open one

107
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,931
escape route

108
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,299
So where is this secret door?

109
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,701
Right here

110
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,302
But the specific location

111
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,103
I haven't found it yet

112
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,672
The only clue now is

113
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,407
The word rain in spring rain

114
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,410
Just find this symbol

115
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,979
You can find the secret door

116
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,264
dad

117
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,633
Come and see

118
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,408
on the wall of my dungeon room

119
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,709
there is another part

120
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,514
Yan Mingliang

121
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,416
When constructing the ultimate space

122
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
Take the secret door apart again

123
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,823
In other words, the word rain

124
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,325
split into different parts

125
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,126
That

126
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,127
this symbol

127
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,261
The one with me in the dungeon

128
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,062
The proportions are the same

129
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,096
should

130
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,665
There are also three parts

131
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,266
three parts

132
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:07,847
Right

133
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,415
I was in the control room at that time

134
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,015
Under the console

135
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,250
I have also seen similar symbols

136
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,952
It should also be part of the rain

137
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:23,896
good

138
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,832
Now we need three groups of people

139
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,834
Guard the three known places

140
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,770
80,000 Xiaoqin

141
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,472
You two just stay here.

142
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,774
Karen and I go to the monitoring room

143
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,376
Then I'll go to the dungeon

144
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,611
I'm with my senior sister

145
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,746
In addition, two groups of people are needed

146
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,382
Continue searching for the remaining two parts

147
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,183
OK

148
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,885
Then we are a group of three brothers

149
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,786
We are the best at finding things.

150
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,290
Spring Rain Gao Xuan

151
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,458
You two are in a group

152
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:53,626
good

153
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,703
Everyone uses walkie-talkies to communicate

154
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,272
Split up

155
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:08,674
Walk

156
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:10,809
Walk

157
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:27,726
OK?

158
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:28,661
OK

159
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:29,929
elder brother

160
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,531
How to find it?

161
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,168
It seems there is only one way

162
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,248
Paint the wall with your eyes

163
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,619
Find inch by inch

164
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,621
Absolutely not

165
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,689
Let go of every corner

166
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,325
Paint the wall

167
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,026
Do you have a better way?

168
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:03,662
no

169
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,431
If not, then go to work and look for it.

170
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,432
Really

171
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,907
Senior sister

172
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,576
This is Chunyu’s room

173
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,586
Wenya, let’s look for them separately

174
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:40,733
no

175
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,135
I must make it clear to my senior sister

176
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,672
Senior sister

177
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,675
Before

178
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,344
I'll let you into the game

179
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,312
It's my fault

180
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,148
When you ask about helmets

181
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,584
I should have warned you

182
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,386
if not for

183
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,387
know this helmet

184
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,254
how could it happen

185
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,222
Such an exciting thing

186
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,059
I'm sorry too

187
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,461
I treated you before

188
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,630
Your brother

189
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,232
And spring rain

190
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,167
did some bad things

191
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:17,436
But now these

192
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,170
None of it matters anymore

193
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,705
What's important

194
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,373
we became friends

195
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,608
And fight together

196
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,845
Okay, look for it quickly

197
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,780
Uncle Chun, is this it?

198
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:06,652
right

199
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,253
that's it

200
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:10,889
control room symbol

201
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:11,623
Already found

202
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,126
The dungeon was also found

203
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,728
We are still looking for it here

204
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,897
Already found clues

205
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,565
Our side

206
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,100
in steady progress

207
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,367
good

208
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,870
Report any situation at any time

209
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,072
Brother Qiang

210
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,308
The clue you mentioned

211
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,209
where

212
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,244
This

213
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,946
Don't stare at me for the first half of the sentence

214
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,647
The key is the last half of the sentence

215
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,649
We are making steady progress

216
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:40,619
Keep looking

217
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:43,989
Don't sigh

218
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:44,990
You listen to big brother

219
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,191
Find it quickly

220
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,664
You say

221
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:53,899
That thing

222
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,833
What does it look like?

223
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,503
What else could this look like?

224
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,971
The word rain in spring rain

225
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,873
It’s not like you haven’t read the book

226
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,074
I can’t write the word rain

227
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,809
That's not to say

228
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,444
Is it part of the rain?

229
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,179
I don't know what it looks like either.

230
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:08,714
I'm thinking

231
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,449
What if I see it?

232
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,750
But what did you think it was?

233
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,885
ghost talisman symbol

234
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:13,819
Missed it again

235
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,365
Black Er

236
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,934
Write the word rain

237
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,194
follow me

238
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,029
Go, go, go

239
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,875
Everyone has something to do now

240
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,009
Just the two of us here

241
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:11,643
Do nothing

242
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,313
You can't say that

243
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,814
Can you keep us both here?

244
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,349
It means we two are very powerful.

245
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,651
Why don't you two be timid?

246
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,419
Otherwise, they will be killed by these zombies

247
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,286
Scared to death?

248
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,287
what really

249
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,355
You can tell me everything

250
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:28,860
Come

251
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,447
What's up

252
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:49,715
He He moved

253
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:29,888
quick

254
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,092
The jailer came to life

255
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,993
The jailer came to life

256
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:35,927
The jailer came to life

257
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:36,895
The jailer came to life

258
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:42,834
Uncle Chun

259
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,635
Find a way quickly

260
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,782
80,000 Xiaoqin

261
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,817
You go to the cafeteria now

262
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,619
Lure the jailer over

263
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,668
Spring Rain Gao Xuan

264
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,636
Be prepared

265
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:28,613
This way

266
00:23:59,137 --> 00:23:59,905
I found it

267
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,309
we also found

268
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,644
The last part is in the cafeteria

269
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,915
80,000 Xiaoqin

270
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,583
You two stay in the cafeteria

271
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,684
Spring Rain Gao Xuan

272
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,019
Hurry back to the gate

273
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,221
gone

274
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,166
I'm counting three now

275
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,269
We press the symbols at the same time

276
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,286
three

277
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,058
two

278
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:57,729
one

279
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,395
Chun Yiming, this bastard

280
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,147
You thought it was over

281
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,484
not that easy

282
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,453
Mr. Yan

283
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:03,455
Stop it

284
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,024
Before it's too late

285
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,864
you are right

286
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,752
It's not too late now

287
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:54,205
no

288
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,206
Uncle Chun

289
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,574
Where is the escape route?

290
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,411
Just wait until I enter the code

291
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:30,742
alright

292
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,277
Let's go everyone

293
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:33,978
Walk

294
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,456
Dad what are you doing

295
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,892
my own affairs

296
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,626
not finished yet

297
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:53,965
Uncle Chun

298
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,167
This is your hard work for more than ten years

299
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,736
I don't want to either

300
00:28:58,937 --> 00:28:59,771
But there is no way

301
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,341
what do you mean

302
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,012
It's a self-destruct program

303
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:10,648
That

304
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,649
all of us

305
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,218
Let's go together when Uncle Chun is done

306
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,786
Everyone, hurry up and leave

307
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,621
To prevent long nights and many dreams

308
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,257
Anyway, you stay here

309
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,525
Can't help me with anything

310
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,660
Besides, there is Mr. Nian outside to help.

311
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,995
There won't be any problem

312
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,430
It's OK

313
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:26,498
Let's all go first

314
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,333
OK

315
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:29,901
Then we

316
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:31,770
The three brothers went out first

317
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:40,712
That

318
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,214
See you outside

319
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:45,717
I'm leaving

320
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:46,651
See you outside

321
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,464
That

322
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,566
The two of us also left first

323
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,980
We're here. See you outside.

324
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,256
No, Yan Mingliang came in

325
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,860
Don't worry, let's go

326
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,776
Let's go

327
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,115
Let's go

328
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,928
I know you want to stay

329
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,196
I'll accompany you

330
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,533
You persuade others to leave

331
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,269
But he stayed

332
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,272
I'm no one else now

333
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,867
Yan Mingliang is coming soon

334
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:18,703
But don't worry

335
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:19,804
I am here

336
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,306
Your dad will be fine

337
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:41,826
spring rain

338
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,496
you came out

339
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,168
Annual total

340
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,273
Where's Gao Xuan?

341
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,008
Is he awake yet?

342
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,543
Yan Mingliang discovered it

343
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,143
That secret door

344
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,145
Gao Xuan pushed me out

345
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,513
But he hasn't come out yet

346
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,382
What about the others?

347
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,950
Everyone else came out

348
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,385
Only Gao Xuan and my dad

349
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,086
Didn't come out

350
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,204
Laochun

351
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,272
pity

352
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:29,974
Still a little worse

353
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,513
This system is your years of hard work

354
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,749
You can do it too

355
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,418
Precisely because it is my years of hard work

356
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:41,953
I don't want it

357
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,288
Become a tool for you to satisfy your selfish desires

358
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:46,891
so

359
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,526
You must destroy it

360
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,696
Because you ruined it a long time ago

361
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:54,632
This was originally a

362
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,234
Works that span the ages

363
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,236
A game that makes people happy

364
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,138
Not like this now

365
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,307
This high-sounding principle

366
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,876
It’s better not to talk about it anymore

367
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:10,782
tell the truth

368
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,651
I don't want to ruin it

369
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,421
After all, it's the two of us

370
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,556
Made it bit by bit

371
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,292
Just like our children

372
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,195
bright

373
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,031
can you stop for a moment

374
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,967
Let’s take this basic loophole

375
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,603
Repair it, solve it

376
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:33,538
then

377
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,906
are you willing to make it

378
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,507
Nineteenth floor is fine

379
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,675
or made

380
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,976
Anything else is fine too

381
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:40,745
I'll help you

382
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,047
Can we do it together?

383
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:49,587
Laochun

384
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,226
Too late

385
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,061
Why is it too late?

386
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,663
As long as you are on the cliff

387
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,470
If Zi Qi were still here

388
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,538
She certainly wouldn't want it

389
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,539
see his father

390
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,141
Become like this now

391
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,314
But she's gone

392
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,215
This is what I can do for her

393
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,049
the only thing

394
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:18,916
bright

395
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,352
Can you listen to me?

396
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,753
Stop it

397
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,554
Say no more

398
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,589
impossible

399
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,261
Self-destruct program activated

400
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,531
Countdown five minutes

401
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,103
so

402
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,471
You talk to me so much

403
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,306
Just to delay time

404
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,144
in this house

405
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,346
There can be more than one terminal

406
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,386
Really ruins the game

407
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,989
It was in the system before Yongcheng

408
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,290
installed program

409
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,460
Wait until this code is solved

410
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,296
game will be over

411
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,208
Uncle Chun, let’s go

412
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,018
Gao Xuan

413
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:03,654
why you

414
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,022
to ruin my plan

415
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,409
Why

416
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,777
why stop me

417
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,778
Revenge for my daughter

418
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:29,814
Why

419
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,984
Why

420
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,335
You can't escape anymore

421
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:07,952
Mr. Yan

422
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,254
actually i know

423
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,290
you do it all

424
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,058
not for

425
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,226
avenge your daughter

426
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,529
But because you hate yourself

427
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,867
You hate that day

428
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,336
I couldn’t see her live broadcast

429
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,371
Couldn't save her

430
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,074
It's you who don't dare

431
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,209
Not willing to face it

432
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,044
this fact

433
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,183
you won't understand

434
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,186
a father

435
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,623
The pain of losing a daughter

436
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:47,892
I know

437
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,629
I can understand it too

438
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,297
the pain of losing a loved one

439
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,501
Just like my father back then

440
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,371
He left him because of my mother

441
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,707
Just take your anger out on me

442
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,209
Angry at the whole world

443
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:08,846
when he drinks

444
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,114
when you die in front of me

445
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,416
I just know

446
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,186
He just blames himself

447
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,087
not doing well enough

448
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,155
Choosing to escape

449
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,295
But if he doesn't face it correctly

450
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,330
From that pain forever

451
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,231
Can't get out

452
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,834
make himself

453
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,535
and people around him

454
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,771
They will keep getting hurt

455
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:48,352
Mr. Yan

456
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,222
this world

457
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,289
There is a dark side

458
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,292
But the meaning of our lives

459
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,129
Isn’t it just to find the light?

460
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,967
We all have had misfortunes

461
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,170
But the spring rain becomes warmer

462
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,105
Brother Qiang is no longer selfish

463
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,374
Qingyou also learns to be brave

464
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,511
We are all actively working hard

465
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,712
start a new life

466
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:16,947
Mr. Yan

467
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,583
If your daughter is still alive

468
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,020
She must hope that her father

469
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,055
look forward

470
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:25,689
dad

471
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,291
I regret

472
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:28,793
if i didn't come

473
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,027
This scary ghost house

474
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,595
I won't be hurt

475
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,697
I still like it

476
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,699
bright warm world

477
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:47,545
Uncle Yan

478
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,246
There's still time

479
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:50,981
let's go out together

480
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:56,454
let's go together

481
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:57,388
OK come

482
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:03,828
Gao Xuan

483
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,985
Gao Xuan
