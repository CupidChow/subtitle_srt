1
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,280
What are you thinking about?

2
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Miss Doudou

3
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
Are you serious about playing games?

4
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Be careful to be cheated

5
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Come into the game, it's too dangerous

6
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,960
Don't enter the game

7
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,400
What to do with Doudou

8
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,320
Yang Bawan

9
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,720
what to do

10
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,280
Look at your face

11
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
a mask of pain

12
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,360
Didn't even eat any food

13
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
I feel full just thinking about Doudou

14
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
What did you say?

15
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,400
You just said it yourself

16
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,240
Miss Doudou

17
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,720
Let's eat. Let's eat.

18
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,880
Thank you

19
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Xiaoya

20
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
My brother got a new job

21
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
Earn much more than before

22
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
Don't get me wrong

23
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm not gloating

24
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,280
you are back

25
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Qingyou, are you okay?

26
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,240
She has a chip in her brain

27
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,200
you

28
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,080
I

29
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
Everyone involved in the game

30
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,640
All

31
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,280
that's why we

32
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
without any auxiliary equipment

33
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,120
The reason why you can enter the game

34
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,560
wafer

35
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,480
What do you mean

36
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,360
This is what God did

37
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
There will be no one but them

38
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,240
Then Qingyou will remain in a coma.

39
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,080
actually

40
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,400
In fact, if we

41
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
If you continue the game

42
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,160
Clear customs

43
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,160
can wake her up

44
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,800
OK

45
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,600
are you sure

46
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,360
I just like playing games

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
And in the game world

48
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,360
than reality

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
My legs and feet are also much cleaner.

50
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,600
I thank you on behalf of Qingyou

51
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,720
don't take me

52
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,920
That's too noble to say

53
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
If I get tired of playing by then

54
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,360
I'll be the first

55
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,400
Take out the chip

56
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,120
We'll meet in the cafeteria in the afternoon

57
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,560
Let’s meet in the game

58
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
I am Doudou

59
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
You have to keep it a secret for me

60
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm exhausted

61
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,080
You are all here, then help me

62
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,320
never mind

63
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,080
It is better to ask for yourself than to ask for others

64
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
What about Yang Bawan?

65
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
Will he continue the game?

66
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,360
I have something on my mind, Sakuragi Hachiman

67
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,400
ball

68
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,080
Otherwise

69
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,600
I beat you by one goal

70
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
Just answer me a question

71
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Why do you look down on me?

72
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Can you please stop causing trouble?

73
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,640
if you win

74
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,440
You can also let me go

75
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,280
Okay, compared to what?

76
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,400
Free throw line, one player, one ball

77
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,960
If you don’t make a bet, you lose.

78
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,040
Come

79
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,760
Come

80
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,880
Come

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,560
You

82
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,840
You, please slow down

83
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,720
Bet

84
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
Willing to admit defeat

85
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
I know what you want to ask

86
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
Even if I tell you, you don’t understand

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,760
What a waste of time

88
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,280
It's because of Doudou

89
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
That game is too dangerous

90
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,360
If I go

91
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I will be in danger

92
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
If I don't go

93
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,200
That

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,640
Anyway, I don’t want to lose contact with her

95
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,200
you know

96
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Just because you are afraid

97
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,520
What what am I afraid of

98
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm afraid she's in danger

99
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,560
OK

100
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,520
That game is really weird

101
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,120
Many people are

102
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Something happened one after another

103
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm worried about her

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
I have to tell her

105
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,920
but

106
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,160
I am very afraid to enter the game

107
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,040
But what if she were

108
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,920
There is one that is three long and two short

109
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,440
I will regret it for the rest of my life

110
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,040
OK

111
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,440
Since it's so dangerous

112
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
She might not go either

113
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,160
No

114
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,160
she will

115
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
Because she is braver than us

116
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,800
She is my whole life

117
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,680
The most beautiful I have ever seen

118
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,480
The most sassy

119
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,720
The kindest girl

120
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,680
Okay, okay, Internet addicted boy

121
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,360
Of course

122
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,800
It's not entirely because of her

123
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,200
I know how you can

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,160
So kind-hearted

125
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,480
no

126
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
Is that because other friends are having difficulty?

127
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,640
I have to find Doudou

128
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,200
tell her

129
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,720
Can't let her

130
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,600
Without knowing anything

131
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,800
Facing these dangers

132
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
You big man

133
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
Why mother-in-law?

134
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,240
You go find her and protect her

135
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
Solved the problem with her

136
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Isn’t that enough?

137
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,440
what did you just say

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,920
Yes

139
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,680
I can be in the game

140
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,640
Protect her

141
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,960
Okay, Xiaoqin

142
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,120
A sudden enlightenment

143
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,800
pass

144
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,440
I

145
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,480
I decide now

146
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,600
Enter the game with her

147
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,680
ok you

148
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,680
I didn’t expect it, Nan Xiaoqin

149
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,800
In your dog's mouth

150
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
He can also spit out ivory.

151
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,160
You just have itchy skin, Yang Bawan

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,640
I

153
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,440
I'm not

154
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm kidding you

155
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,920
You just deserve to be beaten

156
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,120
that is

157
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Slow down

158
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,600
Uncle Lin

159
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,720
Take the matches out of my pocket quickly

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,040
Run quickly

161
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,520
this time

162
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
Finally I'm protecting you

163
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,360
Is there any food left, master?

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Quiet

165
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm sorry

166
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm reading in the library

167
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,640
I forgot the time and I'm late

168
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,880
I haven't moved here

169
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,880
How about you eat first?

170
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
No thanks, master

171
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,160
Uncle, your legs are healed

172
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,560
uncle

173
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
Can you understand what I'm saying?

174
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,440
It seems

175
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
They probably won't come

176
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,320
Let's wait a little longer

177
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,680
Uncle Lin

178
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,560
Uncle Lin

179
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,720
Gao Xuan Chunyu

180
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,920
sit down and talk

181
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,360
I'll come

182
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
It represents my attitude

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,640
I continue

184
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,040
but

185
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
What about 80,000 and Aqiang?

186
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,440
come out

187
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,600
Walk

188
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,480
Come up

189
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,960
Don't move

190
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,120
Don't move

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,720
Sorry, 80,000

192
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't blame me

193
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,280
If you want to blame, blame your dad

194
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
I haven't settled the old score with him yet.

195
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
This is a new feud

196
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,920
You don't have to look everywhere

197
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
This is my brother's old factory

198
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
It has been closed for more than half a year

199
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,040
Everyone is gone

200
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Called Tiantian Yingying

201
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,720
Called the earth and the earth are not working well

202
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,120

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll tie you up

204
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,240
I just want your dad to pay back the money

205
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,560
As long as your dad pays back the money

206
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,560
I will never touch you

207
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,040
I can't help it either

208
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,320
my brothers

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,120
Already in the game

210
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,800
Something happened

211
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,240
What if something happens to me?

212
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,320
Can't wake up

213
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,800
I want to give it to my brother’s house at least

214
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,720
An explanation

215
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
The key is this is your dad

216
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,840
Money owed to my company

217
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
Wasn't he supposed to be there?

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,640
This is your dad

219
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,640

220
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,200

It's me. I was really kidnapped.

238
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,400
You take that strong brother’s money

239
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,120
Give it back to him

240
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,240
The brat doesn’t have this monthly living allowance.

241
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,280
It’s all spent on you

242
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,440
hungry

243
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,600
No daddy

244
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,440
I was really kidnapped

245
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,280
it's really me

246
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,040
Just don't ignore me

247
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm done

248
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,280
It's over, Dad

249
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
Then you'll be finished as soon as possible

250
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
dad

251
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,360
Hey hey dad

252
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,200

253
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,280

254
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,160
Just hung up

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,880
no no

256
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,840
Don't talk nonsense

257
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,800
It's all barbecue

258
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,360
Come, come, come

259
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,880
Playing cards Playing cards

260
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,040
I know I want to eat it every day

261
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
What to bake?

262
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,000
You were picked up by your father, right?

263
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,520
Now you understand

264
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,440
You ask him to pay back the money

265
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,360
Basically it's impossible

266
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,600
Your dad is an asshole

267
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
A gangster

268
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,680
He has no money, so forget it

269
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,320
Even if he has money, he won’t pay it back

270
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,680
I think your father is

271
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
I won’t shed tears without seeing the coffin

272
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,080
I want to give him a hard look

273
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,480
Brother Qiang

274
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,560
Brother Qiang

275
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,000
It’s easy to discuss if you have anything to say

276
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,360
I'll give my dad another shot

277
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,040
Okay, Brother Qiang?

278
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,200
Brother Qiang

279
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,120
Brother Qiang, don’t, don’t, don’t

280
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,640
You, calm down

281
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,480
I will give it to my dad again

282
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,200
How about a fight?

283
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,160
Brother Qiang, don’t

284
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,680
It's a call. It's a call.

285
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,400
Called

286
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,960
What a broken phone

287
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,880
How to fix black screen

288
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
You know Yang is scared, right?

289
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Then I warn you

290
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
You will immediately

291
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,120
Pay the money to my card

292
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,240
Otherwise I will take your son

293
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
Kill Yang Bawan

294
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,360
what did you say

295
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,120
Wrong

296
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,200
Hand over money

297
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,040
hand in hand

298
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,320
I warn you

299
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
This was before I started

300
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,840
the last chance for you

301
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,880
Did you hear that?

302
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,520
OK I promise you

303
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,880
But you have to promise me

304
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,680
Hello

305
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,520
they two together

306
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,320
But Brother Qiang kidnapped 80,000

307
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,120
That

308
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Why am I looking for you?

309
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,600
There must be something here

310
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
Is there any misunderstanding?

311
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,720
Brother Qiang takes me for granted

312
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,400
Eighty thousand father

313
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,000
let me pay back the money

314
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,840
he wants me

315
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,200
Pay money with one hand and hand over people with the other

316
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,600
time place

317
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,320
right

318
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
This strong brother

319
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,760
Meeting in a place like this in broad daylight

320
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,840
spring rain

321
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,600
It's not convenient for you to go in either

322
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,840
This way

323
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,120
Uncle Lin, let’s go in

324
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,880
good

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
You take this card first

326
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
Inside is the money Brother Qiang wants.

327
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,680
Let's go in and talk to him first.

328
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,080
If the talks fall apart

329
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,000
Call the police directly

330
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,960
That's not Brother Qiang.

331
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
It's all come to this point

332
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,800
I can't care about that much anymore

333
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,920
Let’s talk in the game

334
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,760
Let's go in and find someone

335
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Sir, get your cards in hand

336
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
The bathhouse is not small.

337
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,280
Uncle Lin, let’s take a side

338
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,320
It hurts, it hurts

339
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,760
tap tap tap

340
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,680
Is it 80,000?

341
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,360
Go over and have a look

342
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:28,880
Walk

343
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,440
careful

344
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,560
You should also slow down

345
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:36,920
Uncle Lin

346
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,560
Over there

347
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,600
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

348
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,640
It hurts

349
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,200
You can't be like me

350
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,840
Shut that mouth?

351
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,720
Big brother

352
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,560
It's not his fault

353
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,440
It's your skin, it's too thick

354
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,000
Then try harder

355
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,400
good

356
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,640
Eighty thousand

357
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,080
Lao Gao

358
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,880
Uncle Lin

359
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,040
no

360
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,280
You, you, this

361
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,080
Brother Qiang

362
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,000
rub one

363
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,840
Why are you suddenly

364
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
patient on handle

365
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,280
They were all transferred to the special care ward.

366
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
What is your purpose?

367
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,640
director

368
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,560
In fact, I was coerced

369
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,800
I come to the hospital for further study

370
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,160
It's because of a company called Tianji

371
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,480
spring rain

372
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,200
spring rain

373
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,440
Brother Qiang

374
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,480
Take it first

375
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,960
Here are some of us

376
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,160
Collect money for A Yong’s medical expenses

377
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,080
everyone is a friend

378
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,560
If you have any difficulties, I will definitely help you

379
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,600
calm down first

380
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,360
I won't ask for this money

381
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,640
Say it again

382
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,480
It's not your turn either

383
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,120
Come teach me a lesson

384
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't force yourself

385
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,520
We all know your plight.

386
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,480
Brother Qiang

387
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,680
Why don't you take this money first?

388
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,200
I'll pay them back

389
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,960
What's going on? Take this thing

390
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,800
Come and laugh at me

391
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,040
What kind of birdman are you?

392
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,080
Engage in this kind of own game

393
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,040
Not Brother Qiang, me

394
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,920
Okay, stop talking.

395
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,320
What happened between me and your dad?

396
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,240
Involve you

397
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,920
It's not right to begin with

398
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
But I owe Hei Er and A Yong.

399
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm the big brother

400
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,880
I must ask for it back in person

401
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,560
I didn’t expect him to be very affectionate.

402
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,640
leave him alone

403
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,520
Calm down first

404
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,680
Let’s talk about business first

405
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,320
right

406
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Me I have something else to do

407
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,760
You go back first

408
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,080
Yang Bawan

409
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,880
Eighty thousand

410
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,720
Stop shouting

411
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,440
He'll keep playing

412
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm afraid something will happen to him again

413
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,480
Fine

414
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,480
Let's go back to school first

415
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,480
Uncle Lin

416
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,120
You go back first

417
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,400
Chunyu and I

418
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,520
There's something else

419
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,000
to be processed

420
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,440
That's okay

421
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,680
me me me

422
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,200
There is still work to do in the cafeteria

423
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,720
be safe

424
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,600
be safe

425
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,880
Come

426
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,760
Just inside

427
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,200
I saw an acquaintance of ours

428
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,280
While I was waiting outside

429
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Saw that person too

430
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,200
I just saw two of them

431
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,600
I didn't see one of them clearly.

432
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,680
two people

433
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,640
Then he must be following

434
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,600
Who do we meet?

435
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,560
Could it be that Tianji wants to be in the hospital again?

436
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,400
What are you doing?

437
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,000
broken

438
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,080
He may have discovered

439
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,280
Don't let them get away

440
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,840
Chase separately

441
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,480
Tianji Technology Invitation Letter

442
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,280
It feels quite high-end

443
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,720
What a chicken

444
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,240
south wind

445
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,720
nine cakes

446
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,080
Come quickly

447
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,760
Sanjo

448
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,040
Sanjo

449
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,440
dad

450
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,720
Why are you back?

451
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
me

452
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,480
mutter

453
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,400
What the hell is Dudu?

454
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,400
north wind

455
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,040
I remembered

456
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,120
Weren't you kidnapped?

457
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,680
You can't cheat me out of money

458
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,080
You have to ask for it in person instead, right?

459
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,800
You go back first

460
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm busy

461
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,400
Come on, it's my turn

462
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,040
Right, right, right

463
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,600
What are you doing standing here?

464
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,280
Demonstration

465
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,320
dad

466
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,320
you you put

467
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,200
Pay him back the money you owe Brother Qiang

468
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,640
four loaves

469
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,600
what did you say

470
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,960
I said you pay back the money

471
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,120
That

472
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
Don't worry about the kids, it's adults' business.

473
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,200
No dad

474
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,600
Why are you still justified in owing money?

475
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
little bastard

476
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,440
Get rid of the anger, get rid of the anger

477
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,760
What do you care about with your children?

478
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,400
OK OK OK

479
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,240
I'm doing business here

480
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,200
You go back first

481
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Let’s talk about the money after it’s over

482
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:50,840
Come

483
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,360
come on

484
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,040
Whose turn is it?

485
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,400
It's your turn

486
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,800
It's your turn

487
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,440
It's my turn

488
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,600
It's all a mess, come on

489
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
You owe me the money you owe me now

490
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,280
Give it back to others

491
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
I'm giving you face

492
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,760
Yes, yes, you know how to hit people

493
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
Are you still reasonable?

494
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,440
You are obviously rich

495
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,360
Why don't you pay it back?

496
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,920
Not big or small

497
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,320
Eat everything inside and outside

498
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,080
Lao Yang, look at you

499
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,840
You are a white-eyed wolf

500
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
You are just unreasonable

501
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,360
I would rather not be your son

502
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,720
okay

503
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,040
Why don't you apologize to your father quickly?

504
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,520
I

505
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,640
Why should I apologize?

506
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,600
He was obviously the one who was wrong

507
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,760
He is such a dishonest person

508
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,560
You guys still come here every day

509
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,240
Support his business

510
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
I'll trick you all into it then.

511
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,600
little bastard

512
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,840
I don’t have a son like you

513
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,000
Say less.

514
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,960
Lao Yang Lao Yang

515
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,040
If you don’t pay back the money today

516
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,520
I don’t recognize you as my father anymore

517
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,400
You're always like this

518
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:39,960
you

519
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
Since the demolition was completed

520
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,720
Your whole person has changed

521
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,040
Since childhood, you have given me nothing but

522
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,960
Leave two money aside

523
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,120
What else have you ever cared about me?

524
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
do you really care about me

525
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,320
you know what i really am

526
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,200
do you want anything

527
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,160
what i like

528
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,000
don't like what

529
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,960
I ask you

530
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,160
The university I am attending now

531
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,640
What's your name? Do you know?

532
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,120
Nothing but money and mahjong are on your mind

533
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,080
What else do you have?

534
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,160
Give me a name

535
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,880
They are all called 80,000

536
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,720
I do not care

537
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,320
You must pay back the money today

538
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,000
you

539
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,520
You're stupid. Why don't you hide?

540
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,760
Leave it alone

541
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,800
This matter is not resolved today

542
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,480
I do not go

543
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,440
the idea

544
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,640
You gave it to my son, right?

545
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,160
You gave it to my son, right?

546
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,640
What's wrong

547
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,920
You like to hit people, right?

548
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,920
Come, I'll fight you

549
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,520
Come on

550
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,320
Come on

551
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,440
Come on

552
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,240
I want to help him

553
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,960
I can't stand it

554
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,800
You are a hooligan

555
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,600
who is the gangster

556
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,800
Who is the gangster? Get out

557
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
You give the money back to people now

558
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,800
now

559
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,640
roll

560
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,560
You don't pay back

good

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,400
good

563

Let's go, let's go, let's go

564
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,600
I call the police

565
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,080
Yes, yes, yes

566
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,040
Beat me, beat me to death

567
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,560
Beat me to death and no one will care about your money.

568
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,280
roll

569
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,000

Brother Qiang

582
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,440
Sorry

583
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,960
You don't have to

584
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,840
Say sorry to me

585
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,000
What about your dad?

586
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
I got you involved

587
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,880
It's my fault in the first place

588
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,720
I should say sorry to you

589
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,120
Come

590
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,160
You two are ready

591
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,560
Okay, let's eat

592
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
I'm more annoyed than you, I didn't even think about it

593
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,160
right?

594
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,240
Hello

595
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,120
Mr. Chen

596
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,200
It's about Lao Yang

597
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,960
hadron

598
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,560
You have two brushes

599
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,960
The money owed by Lao Yang

600
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,320
I thought it was all in vain.

601
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,480
what do you mean

602
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,480
What's the meaning

603
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,480
The money is coming

604
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,440
well

605
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,400
well done

606
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
Commission for the three of you

607
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
It's all transferred to your account

608
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,600
I'll add ten percent to your share

609
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,640
You said this is the money you owe

610
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,120
How does it feel like I picked it up?

611
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,520
Good job

612
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm optimistic about you

613
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:52,960
Hang up

614
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,200
Brother Qiang Brother Qiang

615
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,480
Speak well if you have something to say

616
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,320
what are you doing

617
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,720
Your dad paid back the money

618
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,080
Your dad paid back the money

619
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,200
My boss also said

620
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,080
Give me an extra 10% commission

621
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,160
My dad paid it back

622
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,280
give me your hand

623
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:03,920
Yang Bawan

624
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
Your brother is interesting enough

625
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,280
Starting from today No.

626
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
from now on

627
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,960
You Yang Bawan

628
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,320
Wrong

629
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,040
I, Zhang Tianqiang, am your eldest brother

630
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,680
All the things about you Yang Bawan

631
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,920
It's all on me

632
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,040
real

633
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,480
real

634
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,440
Although I didn’t catch up with them today

635
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,160
But the person who met Dr. Jia

636
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
I always feel like I’ve seen it somewhere

637
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,320
why do you think so

638
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,200
have no idea

639
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
The body shape always feels familiar

640
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,640
And that mole

641
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,320
What mole

642
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,400
Although in the bathhouse

643
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
I didn't see his face clearly

644
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,800
but

645
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,840
That person's right hand

646
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,160
I put it on the wardrobe at that time

647
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,000
And on the back of his right hand

648
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,480
There is a very obvious mole

649
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,080
I always feel like that mole

650
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,000
Where have I seen

651
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,160
spring rain

652
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,880
Lao Gao

653
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,600
I decided

654
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,680
I want to continue the game

655
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,360
What about 80,000?

656
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,960
Eighty thousand as my good brother

657
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,720
He must have listened to his elder brother

658
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,920
Brother Qiang and I are of the same mind

659
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,000
Very good

660
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,720
no

661
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,840
When will you two

662
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,680
Become good brothers

663
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,000
Charisma

664
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,960
You do not understand

665
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,720
Okay

666
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,920
I brought my words

667
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,800
I have to leave beforehand

668
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,960
Let's get there

669
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,400
See you at the game

670
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:35,920
Gone

671
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,920
Big brother

672
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,320
that

673
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,480
The ground hasn't been mopped yet

674
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,240
Okay, when you get there

675
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,160
Don't hold me back in the game

676
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,720
my eldest brother

677
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm really convinced

678
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
It doesn't sound right either.

679
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,600
Just shoot and fire

680
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,080
no

681
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,680
Lao Yang

682
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,160
How about we stop here today?

683
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,680
You have something on your mind

684
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,480
You can't make peace either

685
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,360
Who can't make peace?

686
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,280
You can't make peace with me

687
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,160
You crow mouth

688
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,200
Hurry up

689
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,840
It's your turn

690
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,080
I'm with

691
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,720
Just right Just right

692
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,840
It's not too early

693
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,440
end it

694
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,320
end end

695
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,960
What ends? What ends?

696
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Don't, don't, don't

697
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Let’s play four more rounds

698
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,880
Come again Come again Come again

699
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,720
I tell you about you

700
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
You are leaving today

701
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,920
No one will come here from now on

702
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,000
Hit it again, hit it four more times

703
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,600
OK OK OK

704
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,080

It's okay to go back, you say?

710
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,440
Eighty thousand is coming

711
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,560

Me, I brought you some kebabs

714
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,920
You got the wrong person, right?

715
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,240
Four tubes

716
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,120

717
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,560

I'm really hungry

720
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,640
Otherwise

721
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,760
I'll eat something first

722
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,280
You put it here

723
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,920
My son bought this for me

724
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,520
If you want to eat, let your son buy it

725
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,920
stingy

726
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360

No more playing No more playing No more playing

00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,040
Didn't you say you should fight four times?

730
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,640
No more playing No more playing No more playing

731
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,680

What happened today?

736
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,200
Go, go, go

forget yourself

741
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,080
This is the basis of performance.

742
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,080

746
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
You move bigger

747
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440

751
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Very good

752
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,680
