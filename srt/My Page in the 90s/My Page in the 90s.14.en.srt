12
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,750
Then my wish is

13
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,949
for smooth sailing

14
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,869
and a swift finish.

15
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,509
Finish what?

16
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:02,069
To finish destiny's arrangement,
of course.

17
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:07,910
I'll drink.

18
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,270
It's my turn.

19
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,990
Spade, Mr. Gao.

20
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:25,110
I... I'd better drink first.

21
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
I have no wishes.

22
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,390
- No.
- No.

23
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,629
You must say one.

24
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:29,830
Not following the rules?

25
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:31,230
I just said mine.

26
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,950
Exactly.

27
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,709
Don't you want to find a girlfriend?

28
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,230
What if I already have one?

29
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:42,909
Who?

30
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,670
You can only ask one question.

31
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,230
I... I'll draw.

32
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:50,110
Yours.

33
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,149
I...

34
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,909
I hope that in the future, I will

35
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,830
be braver at work.

36
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,790
And in love too.

37
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,709
Wait a minute.

38
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:12,429
Tiehan, you need to be more specific.

39
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:13,429
How to be braver?

40
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,709
For example,

41
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,830
how to be braver with Mengmeng?

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,830
Right? Pursue Mengmeng bravely?

43
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,510
Stop.

44
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,110
Tiehan, just be brave and be yourself.

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,589
Do whatever you want.

46
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,110
Mengmeng, your turn.

47
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,110
Actually,

48
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,189
I think I'm already doing great.

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,350
I have my job

50
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,070
and people I love.

51
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,550
And most importantly, I have you all.

52
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,869
Do you know that on this planet,

53
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,510
the probability of two people meeting

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,469
is only 0.00478?

55
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,350
Such a tiny chance.

56
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,990
But we gathered together.

57
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,429
What fate is this?

58
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:00,390
What fate?

59
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,110
It... it really is fate.

60
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,909
Let's drink.

61
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,350
- Come on.
- Come on.

62
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,550
You haven't drunk this.

63
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,270
I'll drink two.

64
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,990
Mix this in. Mix it.

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,949
Mengmeng, want to sing something?

66
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:18,350
Yeah, Mengmeng.

67
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,949
I won't sing. Why should I sing?

68
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:22,790
You sing so beautifully.

69
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,590
I remember your high school dream

70
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,910
was to debut as a singer.

71
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,670
You even won a singing contest.

72
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:28,629
Sing one.

73
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:29,509
- No.
- Sing one.

74
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:30,309
- No.
- Come on.

75
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:31,710
- I won't sing.
- Sing one.

76
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:32,790
I won't sing.

77
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,110
I won't sing.

78
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:38,949
Excuse me.

79
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:39,949
Sorry to bother you.

80
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,110
Could my friend sing a song?

81
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:43,309
Of course. Welcome.

82
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,629
Thank you.

83
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,269
Hurry.

84
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,509

Your friend

104
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,069

He said he's a music producer

112
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:20,710
and told me to give this to Mengmeng.

113
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,710
Not a scam, is it?

114
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,150
(It's her career's turning point.)

115
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,110
No, absolutely not a scam.

116
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,110
You must give her this card.

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,910

Mr. Gao works tomorrow
and must rise early. I'll take him home.

134
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:08,269
Tell Mengmeng for me.

135
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:08,872
Okay.

136
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,790
Mr. Gao, let me take you home.

137
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:11,710
It's too late.

138
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,350
Thank you all.

139
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,189
Not bad at all.

140
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,389
Why did they leave?

141
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,790
They said Mr. Gao
has something tomorrow.

142
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,509
So they left.

143
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,030
Let's go too, Silly Goose.

144
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:32,509
Hold on.

145
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,350
Mengmeng, this is for you.

146
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,470
He said he's a music producer.

147
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,150
Could it be a scam?

148
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,710
Why are you laughing?

149
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,309
Because your reaction
was exactly like mine.

150
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:49,309
But Huan'er just said

151
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:50,030
it's not a scam.

152
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,629
Relax.

153
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,269
Well, since she said so,

154
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,230
it's definitely fine.

155
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,269
Come with me to school again tomorrow.

156
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,749
What for?

157
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,470
Just say yes or no.

158
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:04,648
Yes.

159
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:06,990
Let's go. Take me home.

160
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,269
Thanks for today.

161
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,590
Before, because it involved
personal feelings,

162
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,389
it wasn't convenient to explain.

163
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:28,949
Hope you don't mind.

164
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,949
I had my own motives too.

165
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:34,350
What?

166
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,509
I helped resolve your concerns.

167
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,950
Now I can go all out to do some things.

168
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,350
I meant work.

169
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,310
65.3 percent, 66 percent...

170
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:53,590
Why are you smiling?

171
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,990
Nothing.

172
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,310
I just learned a little secret.

173
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:00,789
What secret?

174
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,830
Secret.

175
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,909
Not sure if it's because
I've been back more often lately,

176
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,389
but I keep remembering things
from the past.

177
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:31,269
Like what?

178
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:34,590
Too many.

179
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,590
Too many memories.

180
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:43,869
Tiehan,

181
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,070
do you remember back in college,

182
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,029
when I came to you?

183
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,830
I remember.

184
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,110
Do you know why I came to you then?

185
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:01,909
I'm sorry, Mengmeng.

186
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,909
- I...
- Why are you apologizing?

187
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,070
I should apologize.

188
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,110
I only found out later

189
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:11,549
that something happened
to your dad that day.

190
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,710
I was too immature back then.

191
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,029
Because of that,

192
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,430
I had been mad at you for months,

193
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,070
ignoring you.

194
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,549
But at that time,

195
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:20,590
you needed company most.

196
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,350
Well...

197
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,029
It was not your fault.

198
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,669
It's okay.

199
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,590
Do you know back then I wanted...

200
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,669
At that time,

201
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,590
we were both too young.

202
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,350
Take Huan'er and Xiaojue's situation.

203
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,430
We used to envy them so much.

204
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,749
Being able to accompany
and support each other,

205
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:49,749
they were so happy.

206
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,590
But after all these years,

207
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:57,110
everything has changed.

208
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,669
I haven't changed.

209
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,749
Why aren't you worried at all?

210
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:46,509
Are you worried?

211
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,990
No, I am just wondering

212
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,789
why you parked so far away.

213
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:52,830
Just to take a walk.

214
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,629
Sometimes walking

215
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:57,269
lets your mind go blank

216
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,830
and gives you some breathing room.

217
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,070
I used to like walking as well.

218
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:06,269
Too bad that I got busy later

219
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,190
and didn't have time.

220
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,389
Then let's walk together from now on.

221
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,830
Sure.

222
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,830
Is this a chair?

223
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,950
It's a seesaw.

224
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,190
A seesaw?

225
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,509
Take that side.

226
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,149
Sit over there.

227
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,470
No way. You're secretly pushing.

228
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,149
No way.

229
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,509
We...

230
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,990
We weigh the same?

231
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,190
Why am I so heavy?

232
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,230
You're not sitting at the end?

233
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,430
Go down. I want to go up.

234
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,950
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

235
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,070
It's... it's fine.

236
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,590
You can go up now.

237
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,710
Didn't you tell me to go down?

238
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:36,350
Yes, but I want to go down now.

239
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,310
G-Go ahead.

240
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:39,629
Okay.

241
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm fine.
My arm strength is pretty good.

242
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,632
Wait...

243
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:47,909
See? I've come up.

244
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,029
You can stand up.

245
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,710
Why not say it earlier?

246
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,909
I thought you knew.

247
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,830
What the heck?

248
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,710
It's not fun at all.

249
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,509
Well...

250
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:17,070
I... I have an appointment
with a distributor in Lvcheng.

251
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,190
I'll go tomorrow.

252
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,149
Will you join me?

253
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:20,830
I will.

254
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:24,749
Just the two of us?

255
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,350
Yes, just the two of us.

256
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,509
Well,

257
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,549
why isn't Luo going?

258
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,264
You've always managed Dr. Wei's matters.
You know better than Luo.

259
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:37,669
That's true.

260
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,070
Indeed, I know a bit more.

261
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,110
If it's for work,

262
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,070
then I agree.

263
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:44,040
Okay.

264
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:46,869
I'll go home for dinner.

265
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,389
See you.

266
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:49,389
See you.

267
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,149
Where are you going?

268
00:14:58,869 --> 00:14:59,496
Going home.

269
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,070
Are you going to my place?

270
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,509
Sure.

271
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:07,549
Come on.

272
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,950
Huan'er.

273
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,509
My colleague.

274
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,549
Hello, I'm Gao Haiming,

275
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,509
Lin Huan'er's colleague.

276
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,950
Not bad. I'm quite pleased.

277
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,909
Come out!

278
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,968
Hello.

279
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,110
Hello, sir.

280
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,470
Then let's start eating.

281
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,430
Wait a moment.

282
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:11,830
Huan'er, get up.

283
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,272
Move aside.

284
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:20,950
Sit.

285
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:34,470
Gao, come on.

286
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,149
Eat the fish.

287
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,909
Thank you, sir.

288
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,110
The one from earlier.

289
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:39,549
Okay.

290
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,389
And there are ribs.

291
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,070
Sweet and Sour Ribs.

292
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,430
Huan'er and Le'er

293
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,070
love this dish the most.

294
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,710
Eat more while it's hot.

295
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,549
It's enough.

296
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,629
Eat more.

297
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:52,389
Gao,

298
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:55,909
I heard you also work at Letao, right?

299
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:56,710
Yes.

300
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,430
What position?

301
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,950
- Department Manager.
- Department Supervisor.

302
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,390
- Supervisor.
- Manager.

303
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,509
I... I was a supervisor before.

304
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,749
He'll soon be a manager.

305
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:11,309
Yes.

306
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,710
Good.

307
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,430
The name Gao Haiming

308
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,190
sounds so familiar.

309
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,150
- In a magazine...
- You haven't seen it.

310
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,789
Okay.

311
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,470
Being the manager is good.

312
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,430
A bright future ahead.

313
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,269
Come on.

314
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:33,749
Eat more ribs.

315
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:34,390
It's enough.

316
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,789
Being the manager is quite a dedication.

317
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,910
Eat more ribs.

318
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:39,990
Enough. Don't serve him more.

319
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,589
I haven't eaten any yet.

320
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,309
What's the rush?

321
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:44,789
I can make it for you every day.

322
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:46,950
Gao rarely comes, right?

323
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,069
Eat more.

324
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay.

325
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,829
Right!

326
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,230
The rice. I forgot to serve the rice.

327
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,710
Well...

328
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,710
It's okay. No rush, sir.

329
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,190
I haven't eaten any yet.

330
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,950
Lin Le'er, I'll hit you.

331
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,670
Take a piece.

332
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,670
Try this. This is delicious.

333
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,470
Say it.

334
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,670
Dad, how about we...

335
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,470
Play mahjong?

336
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,109
Sure. It's been a while since I played.

337
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,870
Mahjong?

338
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,710
I don't know how.

339
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,950
Eight of Dots.

340
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:09,150
Wait.

341
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:10,349
Kong.

342
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,749
Kong?

343
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,549
East Wind.

344
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,789
East Wind? Kong.

345
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:15,670
You kong too?

346
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,549
What are you doing? Let me take my turn.

347
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,990
Red Dragon.

348
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,910
I haven't drawn a tile.

349
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,670
Hurry up.

350
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,470
One of Dots.

351
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,190
- Two of Characters.
- Two of Characters?

352
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,430
Two of Characters? I win!

353
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,029
You win?

354
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,269
I win too.

355
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:28,749
You too?

356
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:31,069
Come on.

357
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:32,712
Food rewards.

358
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,029
And gold coins.

359
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,509
So much. How big was that win?

360
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:36,630
Let's keep going.

361
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,549
Were you offering them tiles
on purpose today

362
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:52,509
just to make them happy?

363
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:54,870
We play for fun, right?

364
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,589
Winning isn't everything.

365
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,910
I never expected

366
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,109
you'd actually know how to play mahjong.

367
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,470
My grandma taught me when I was little.

368
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:07,990
I haven't touched it since.

369
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:11,950
Well?

370
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,589
How's our cooking?

371
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,150
Not as good as yours, huh?

372
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:20,269
Want the truth?

373
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,390
Go ahead.

374
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,109
I think your family's is better.

375
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,309
One particular dish

376
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,509
must've won you over.

377
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,230
Sweet and Sour Ribs? The fish?

378
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:33,829
Neither.

379
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,589
It's because you have an amazing family.

380
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,829
For me,

381
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,109
having the whole family sitting together

382
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,029
to enjoy a meal happily

383
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,749
is the greatest happiness.

384
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,509
Actually, when I first arrived,

385
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:52,829
I didn't get along with them well.

386
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,749
But now I agree with you.

387
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:58,109
They are indeed
wonderful family members.

388
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,269
What do you mean by that?

389
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,990
First...

390
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:05,789
I first arrived in this world.

391
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,829
Childhood is when we all
arrive in this world.

392
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:09,390
Right?

393
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,349
Teach me mahjong when you're free.

394
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,710
Then I can join Mengmeng

395
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,029
and Tiehan to win your money.

396
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,990
Okay.

397
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,749
Then

398
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,230
I'll deduct teaching fees
from your salary.

399
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,509
M-My salary won't cover that, will it?

400
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,870
Thanks for today.

401
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,990
I had a great time.

402
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,549
Me too.

403
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,710
Get some rest now.

404
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,950
By the way,

405
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:41,430
you said Le'er was transferring schools.

406
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,309
Let me know if you need help.

407
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,029
This won't come out of my salary, right?

408
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,749
Good night.

409
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,710
Good night.

410
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,269
Congratulations.

411
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:09,710
Male lead's fondness

412
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,430
toward you has increased to 68 percent.

413
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,069
68 percent?

414
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,670
I can go back soon then.

415
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:25,150
Nothing wrong with going back soon.

416
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,829
Right?

417
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:27,630
Keep pushing.

418
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,910
Lvcheng.

419
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,950
I'll need a solid plan.

420
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,910
Flower shop has to be 2 PM to 3 PM.

421
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:44,789
Peacock Lake...

422
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,309
Peacock Lake closes at 4:30 PM.

423
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,870
Huan'er, you have a job now.

424
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,230
Why do you still do homework?

425
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,269
You know nothing.

426
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:54,309
I'm planning the trip.

427
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,670
Planning? To take down which one?

428
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,749
To take down Haiming?

429
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:01,430
Lin Le'er, what's going on

430
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,470
in your head?

431
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,349
I suspect you're crushing on someone.

432
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,630
Don't worry.

433
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,870
With you as my cautionary tale,

434
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,950
I'll never make your mistakes.

435
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:14,950
I made a good cautionary tale.

436
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,470
Huan'er, listen.

437
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,950
Your taste in men was really bad before.

438
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,990
Ou Xiaojue came to see me
just a couple of days ago.

439
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,670
He did? What did he want?

440
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,430
He asked me
to set up a meeting with you.

441
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,109
He asked me to meet him
at a park south of the city.

442
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,390
He seemed a bit off.

443
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,470
So I ran away quickly.

444
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,470
You did the right thing.

445
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:37,950
With someone like him,

446
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,390
you have to stay vigilant.

447
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,349
If he goes to you again,

448
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:42,950
come find me immediately.

449
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,549
Understand?

450
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:45,870
Okay?

451
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,630
Okay.

452
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,430
Okay.

453
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:51,029
Huan'er,

454
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,950
to be honest,

455
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:53,749
I think Haiming is really

456
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:54,990
a very, very good person.

457
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,950
You have to hold on to him tight.

458
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,950
The way you talk sounds a bit like Dad.

459
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,109
I mean it. If you're with him,

460
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,349
you'll definitely be happy.

461
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,829
Le'er,

462
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:09,870
I'll give your suggestion

463
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,829
serious thought.

464
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,069
You must think about it.

465
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,710
I got it.

466
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,192
(Yunsheng Tower)

467
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,910
Mr. Gao, please sit.

468
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,584
(Inclusion of Letao products in Huineng)
Thanks.

469
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,109
Inclusion of Letao products in Huineng.

470
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,309
Next,

471
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,789
I will elaborate

472
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:47,670
on market share,

473
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,589
brand awareness,

474
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,630
and our sales channels.

475
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,870
These three points
are our most important core.

476
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,349
Product line,

477
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:54,029
process,

478
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:54,870
sales channels,

479
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,950
and market demand.

480
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,470
Demand for feminine hygiene products
keeps growing.

481
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:29,630
Boss, which company
are we going to next?

482
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:37,390
We still have 48 hours to enjoy Lvcheng.

483
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:41,870
What do you mean?

484
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,190
Sorry.

485
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,710
I thought
we could finish the work earlier.

486
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,029
I didn't expect the schedule
to be so packed.

487
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,589
So I extended the business trip

488
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:52,990
by two days.

489
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,390
If you can use

490
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,589
the 48 hours well,

491
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,309
the plans can surely be completed.

492
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:37,190
Where is it?

493
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,789
Where is it?

494
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,512
(No. 24, Old Street, Hanling)

495
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,990
(Forget Me)
We're here. This is the place.

496
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:53,608
(Surrounded by Flowers, Lost in Dreams)

497
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,109
I want to go.

498
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,150
Okay.

499
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:05,190
It's so beautiful in here.

500
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,109
Welcome.

501
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,230
Would you like to plant flowers
or buy flowers?

502
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:10,349
We offer storage and maintenance too.

503
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:11,470
So the flowers you plant

504
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,430
can grow strong, just like your love.

505
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,589
Customers have

506
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,870
always planted flowers here.

507
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,549
Well, actually we're not...

508
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,150
So we can't plant flowers together
if we're not a couple?

509
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,950
You still can.

510
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,269
But if you're a couple
and come together next time,

511
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,150
we'll have

512
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,309
an extra gift for you.

513
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:29,549
We are a couple.

514
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,670
Yes.

515
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,190
With so many beautiful flowers,

516
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,950
why choose sunflowers?

517
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,950
Other couples
would definitely choose roses.

518
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,269
Well, I mean,

519
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,109
roses are clearly more beautiful.

520
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,109
But I think

521
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,910
sunflower symbolism is more interesting.

522
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,230
What is it?

523
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,296
I'll browse first.

524
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:09,470
To browse first? What does it mean?

00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,269
Hurry, only one minute's left.

532
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,230
Hello, two people.

533
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,190
Hello, two people.

534
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:15,630
Hello.

535
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:16,904
Hello.

536
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,749
We're closed.

(Ticket Office)

538
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,109
We missed it by a minute.

539
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,269
We should've come earlier.

540
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,509
Darn it, such a good opportunity.

541
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,029
They say if two people
come here together,

542
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,829
they will be together forever.

543
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:31,990
Hinting at me?

544
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,029
No, not really.

545
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,309
I just think this place

546
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,390
is worth seeing.

547
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,549
It'd be a pity not to visit.

548
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:40,430
It's fine. We can come next time.

549
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,749
There won't be a next time.

550
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,910
Do you think it's easy to take a trip?

551
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,829
Look.

552
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:47,589
Look at what?

553
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,990
Look at these trees.

554
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,309
No one would see them as scenery.

555
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,349
Even when we first arrived,

556
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,870
we didn't notice them either.

557
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,230
But they're still full of life.

558
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,269
So?

559
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:02,430
We came all this way
just to look at trees?

560
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,190
They're everywhere.

561
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,190
Like downstairs at home.

562
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,190
But each one is different.

563
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,269
No matter where you go,

564
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,029
you won't see these trees again.

565
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,509
You mean,

566
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,749
no two leaves in this world
are identical, right?

567
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,870
Gao Haiming,

568
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,509
so you're a philosopher.

569
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,190
Alright.
I want a picture with this tree.

570
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,464
Okay.

571
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,749
Come on.

572
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,589
Three, two, one.

573
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:43,230
Your turn.

574
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:43,944
Okay.

575
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:45,870
You're right.

576
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,549
The scenery here is beautiful too.

577
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,069
But the inside must be better.

578
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:53,190
I just didn't plan well enough today.

579
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,470
If I'd been more thorough,

580
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,789
we could have gone inside.

581
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,109
You

582
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,549
are just too fixated
on reaching a destination

583
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:01,470
and miss the views along the way.

584
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,309
Isn't that an even bigger shame?

585
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,269
You always seem so emotionally stable.

586
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,789
It's not that I'm stable.

587
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,910
You're always in a hurry.

588
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,710
You're in a hurry to find a place,

589
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,109
to solve a problem,

590
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,749
and to finish a task.

591
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,309
Why are you in such a rush?

592
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,870
Am I? Am I really in a hurry?

593
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,789
Yeah.

594
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,029
Sometimes, wasting time

595
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,069
can be a kind of joy too.

596
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,230
Try it.

597
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,509
Wasting time.

598
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,190
Yeah.

599
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,309
You make a good point.

600
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,990
Then let's go fishing.

601
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,990
Fishing?

602
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:42,630
Yeah.

603
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,430
Fishing is the best

604
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,470
time-wasting activity.

605
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,150
Fi...fishing? Forget it.

606
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,749
Up ahead...

607
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:48,710
There's a lake up ahead.

608
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,509
We can fish there.

609
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,069
Since we're here,

610
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,309
let's go fishing today.

611
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:54,589
We might not catch anything, right?

612
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,789
Didn't you say
the result doesn't matter,

613
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:01,749
but the views along the way do?

614
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:03,749
Good.

615
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,150
Fishing is good.

616
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,549
Let's go fishing. To catch a big fish.

617
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,749
We'll eat fish tonight.

618
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,029
Very good.

619
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:19,710
Come here.

620
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,109
I just remembered.

621
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,269
You're afraid of the sea.

622
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:29,230
But this is a lake.

623
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,870
Are you afraid too?

624
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,789
What's scary about this lake?

625
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:33,749
Look, it's very shallow.

626
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:35,710
The water is waist-deep at most.

627
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,910
Don't you think
what's under the water is scary?

628
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,470
It seems calm on the surface.

629
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,190
You never know what's there.

630
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:46,309
Is it scary?

631
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,509
Could there be a monster in there?

632
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:51,336
Got one.

633
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,190
There really is.

634
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:00,390
It is scary.

635
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:00,968
Really.

636
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:02,069
Look.

637
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,589
There are tiny fish in the water.

638
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,830
It seriously hurts

639
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,270
my enthusiasm and self-esteem.

640
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,149
This is scary.

641
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,189
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

642
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,069
Don't overthink.

643
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,549
This tiny fish must've been
overthinking just now

644
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:22,029
and got caught before knowing it.

645
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,069
It's not grown yet.

646
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:24,029
How about we release it?

647
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:25,430
I will.

648
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,189
But not now.

649
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,430
You know?

650
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:30,149
If we release it now,

651
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,069
this tiny fish will spill the beans

652
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,189
and tell the other fish.

653
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,109
Then we won't catch anything today.

654
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:36,790
Going home empty-handed is scarier.

655
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,669
So, we need to wait
until we catch a big one

656
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:42,029
before releasing the small ones.

657
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,310
Are you that sure we'll catch a big one?

658
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:45,270
Absolutely.

659
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,270
Today, I must treat you

660
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,310
to a full banquet of fish I caught.

661
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:51,688
Hurry.

662
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,310
Come on.

663
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:25,149
Bring me the big one.

664
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:26,270
We will catch a big one.
