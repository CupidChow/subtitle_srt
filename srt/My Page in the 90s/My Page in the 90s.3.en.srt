12
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:06,145
Perfect timing.

13
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:09,625
Okay, you go ahead.

14
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:10,065
Thanks.

15
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,185
Mr. Gao, Mrs. Gao.

16
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:11,984
Wanjun.

17
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:12,945
Wanjun.

18
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,305
Thank you.

19
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:16,104
You're welcome.

20
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,424
Mrs. Gao, don't mention it.

21
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:19,704
My father just got off the plane

22
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:20,905
and couldn't make it in time.

23
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:23,424
He asked me
to send his blessings to you.

24
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,625
Look how thoughtful Wanjun is.

25
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,225
Exactly.

26
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,584
Let me tell you something.

27
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:30,704
I couldn't acquire

28
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:33,984
the necklace around your neck
without her help.

29
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:34,505
Really?

30
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:35,305
Mr. Gao.

31
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,424
You're too kind.

32
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:37,664
I'm glad you like it.

33
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:39,704
I do like it.

34
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:45,465
You two have been married for 30 years
and are still so loving.

35
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,225
It's truly enviable.

36
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,584
I wish I could find someone like Haiming

37
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,264
in the future.

38
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,225
H-Haiming.

39
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:03,424
Come here.

40
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,104
Excuse me.

41
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:06,225
Haiming.

42
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,144
Miss Xie.

43
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,864
Haiming, I know
you're quite busy with work.

44
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,424
But at least balance work and life.

45
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,984
When you're available,
you could give Wanjun a call.

46
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,505
You two grew up together,

47
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,745
so you could have a meal,

48
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:19,785
take a walk,

49
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,185
or watch a movie.

50
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,465
And you could call him as well.

51
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:24,104
Right?

52
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,505
Miss Xie, you are so outstanding,

53
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,424
and will surely meet someone
who appreciates you.

54
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,664
Maybe I've already met that person now.

55
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,305
Bless you then.

56
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:45,785
I-I wonder if our Haiming
can be that lucky one in your eyes.

57
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:47,625
Mr. Gao.

58
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,225
Don't be so pushy.

59
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,144
Wanjun is outstanding.

60
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:54,065
There must be many talented young men
pursuing her.

61
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,785
Our Haiming might not
even make the list.

62
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:07,065
Wanjun, here.

63
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,144
Here.

64
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,704
Feel free to visit anytime, okay?

65
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:12,225
Okay.

66
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,105
What did you mean just now?

67
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,545
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

68
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:51,024
You introduced many girlfriends
to Haiming before, right?

69
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,224
Yet he likes no one.

70
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,584
Now Miss Xie is showing
so much interest in Haiming.

71
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,105
This is an opportunity.

72
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,985
The Xie family's Fuchuang Company
can help us open up the northern market.

73
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:04,784
This is the best chance for your son
to expand his business.

74
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,425
Best chance for my son?

75
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,545
(I never expected)

76
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,305
(relationships are still complicated
even in the fiction world.)

77
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:13,185
In your eyes,

78
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:15,105
as long as the price is right,

79
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,945
you can even sell your son, right?

80
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:20,425
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,305
I'm his birth father.

82
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,105
Would I ever harm him?

83
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:25,264
Don't you see?

84
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,464
Haiming doesn't like
that girl named Xie Wanjun.

85
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,264
Is it that important?

86
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,024
Of course.

87
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,105
Haiming's future is what matters most.

88
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,425
- His future.
- Do you really care?

89
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:37,185
(Again with this cliched plot.)

90
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:38,224
Let me tell you.

91
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,704
Haiming is my son.

92
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,745
No one can force him
into doing anything.

93
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:46,144
Let me tell you.

94
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,224
You're really ridiculous.

95
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:49,945
Use your brain and think it over.

96
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:57,505
Why are you here?

97
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:02,545
Mr. Xie should be here.

98
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:04,665
Let's go over.

99
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,264
Chairman.

100
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:07,985
I have things to do.
I need to leave now.

101
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,865
You have to leave now?

102
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,584
Then why did you even come today?

103
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:14,384
You and your mom,

104
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:16,904
are you two set on opposing me today?

105
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:23,425
Mom, how about I take you back?

106
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,784
Gao Haiming, I'll ask you one last time.

107
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:28,185
I said Mr. Xie is here.

108
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,024
Are you going or not?

109
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:30,904
Don't pressure him.

110
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,105
Forget it, Mom.

111
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:33,745
You go first.

112
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:35,985
It's fine.

113
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,704
It's fine.

114
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:42,952
I'll go to the restroom.

115
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,305
(Leave!)

116
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:47,904
Gao Haiming.

117
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:54,425
You've basically met
all those suitable heiresses,

118
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:56,824
but you show no interest.

119
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:58,185
Well, in that case,

120
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,505
I'll make a decision for you.

121
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:02,625
Miss Xie is your best choice.

122
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,464
Just because
she's the heiress of Fuchuang?

123
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,985
So what?

124
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,384
Every decision I made is for you.

125
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,505
Career always comes first for a man.

126
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,824
Don't be ungrateful.

127
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:20,384
Making me lose my patience
won't benefit you.

128
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:23,824
I'll wait in the lobby.

129
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,264
Don't embarrass me and your mom.

130
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:38,945
(Such a domineering father!)

131
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,185
Today's your event.

132
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,024
Why are you so late?

133
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,505
This is my event.

134
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,464
I ran into some friends

135
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:54,464
and chatted with them.

136
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,745
That's the furniture seller.

137
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:07,904
Thank you.

138
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:11,545
Haiming.

139
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,425
Where were you just now?

140
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,584
I've been looking for you.

141
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,264
I got held up.

142
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,144
What a perfect match.

143
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:21,865
Haiming.

144
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,344
What's your plan tomorrow?

145
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,065
Busy tomorrow.

146
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:26,745
The day after tomorrow?

147
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:28,945
Also busy then.

148
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:32,265
Then are you free three days from now?

149
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:33,224
Well,

150
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:34,584
still busy.

151
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:37,224
How are you always so busy?

152
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,040
I'll check out wedding dress
with a friend.

153
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,785
I want you to come with me.

154
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:42,425
Miss Xie.

155
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:43,864
Take a day off,

156
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:44,624
Haiming.

157
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:46,425
Just take one day off.

158
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,425
Just take one day off.

159
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:48,425
- Wait, Miss Xie, you...
- Haiming.

160
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,905
I want you to come with me.

161
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,104
Please.

162
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:52,305
- Miss Xie.
- Haiming.

163
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:53,665
- Miss Xie.
- Please.

164
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,824
- Come with me.
- Miss Xie.

165
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:55,464
Haiming.

166
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:56,824
Please.

167
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:58,065
- Please.
- Please.

168
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,145
- Come with me.
- Come with me.

169
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:00,425
- Haiming.
- Haiming.

170
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,864
- Please.
- Please.

171
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,785
- Come on, Haiming.
- Come on, Haiming.

172
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:04,785
Let's go together.

173
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:06,025
Where are you two going?

174
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:09,945
Who are you?

175
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:12,665
Haiming.

176
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:14,744
Aren't you going to introduce me?

177
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,425
This is Miss Lin, Lin Huan'er.

178
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:23,744
Do you know that girl?

179
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:24,744
Come on! Let's drink.

180
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,464
You must be Miss Xie.

181
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:27,824
Hello.

182
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:30,624
Haiming.

183
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:34,624
You seem quite close to Miss Lin.

184
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:37,945
Kind of close.

185
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,185
Want to leave here?

186
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,665
What are you trying to do?

187
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,864
Miss Lin, we're in public.

188
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:53,025
Please behave.

189
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:55,185
Pardon me?

190
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:56,385
I said,

191
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,344
please behave.

192
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:03,385
Why did you push me?

193
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:05,224
I...

194
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:06,584
How clumsy.

195
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,385
Haiming, I didn't push her.

196
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:09,984
Wanjun, are you okay?

197
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:10,545
Take this.

198
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:11,704
What's wrong?

199
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:12,344
What happened?

200
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,464
- Mr. Gao.
- Mr. Gao.

201
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:15,785
She didn't mean to.

202
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:18,065
It was all my fault.

203
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:22,104
What do you mean?

204
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,584
Wait, hold on.

205
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:26,624
Who are you?

206
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:28,344
Haiming.

207
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,265
Look, your suit is stained.

208
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,545
Go clean up.

209
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,065
Right.

210
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:35,224
I should accompany Haiming
to clean it up.

211
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:35,905
Excuse us.

212
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:37,824
I'll go clean up.

213
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,265
Who are you?

214
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,104
Mr. Gao.

215
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,145
Did you know her?

216
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,905
Wait, why did she know me?

217
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:46,785
Who is she?

218
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:48,545
Who is she?

219
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,185
I remember now.

220
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:54,545
I think I saw her
at the company meeting.

221
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:57,984
She must be a new employee
the company just hired.

222
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,545
Probably a new secretary Haiming hired.

223
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,665
Why would Haiming
hire a secretary like that?

224
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,624
She acted recklessly.

225
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:04,265
Exactly.

226
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:04,864
Mr. Gao.

227
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,425
Fire her.

228
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:07,704
Alright.

229
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,584
I will take care of it right away.

230
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:10,984
Cheer up.

231
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,984
She is so adorable.

232
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:18,344
Enough.

233
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:21,744
Why are you here?

234
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,824
To ask you to let me join Letao.

235
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,145
Why investigate me?

236
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,385
I'll tell you if you hire me.

237
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:38,104
Where are you?

238
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,624
Mr. Gao, I just went to refuel.

239
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:41,665
And I have a traffic jam.

240
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,824
It'll take 20 minutes to get to you.

241
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:44,545
Try your best.

242
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,744
It's the weekend,
so traffic must be heavy.

243
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,624
If you took a car back,

244
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:54,905
you would get home late.

245
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,065
Then you would have no time
to assemble your airplane model.

246
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,824
How did you know
I assemble models at this time?

247
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:04,864
(It was mentioned in the book.)

248
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,545
(Gao Haiming assembles models
whenever he's upset.)

249
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,704
It doesn't matter.
Want to get home in 20 minutes?

250
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:17,145
Take my ride.

251
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,265
As a big boss who is

252
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,984
so wealthy and handsome,

253
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,425
you would have this kind of problem.

254
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,224
Miss Lin.

255
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,744
Please focus on riding.

256
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:38,104
I'm on your side.

257
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,665
Freedom is very important.

258
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,624
Don't talk while riding.

259
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,744
Have you heard
of the misattribution of arousal?

260
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:57,344
What?

261
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,224
(Misattribution of arousal.)

262
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:02,145
(When one is in a tense environment
with a racing heart,)

263
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:05,025
(he mistakenly interprets heart-racing
caused by the situation)

264
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,265
(as the illusion of being attracted
by the other person.)

265
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:27,584
What were you doing?

266
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,785
J-just now...

267
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:32,305
I'll ride.

268
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,824
Did you feel even a little scared?

269
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,344
I don't trust your driving skills.

270
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:41,305
But do you know how?

271
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:43,665
Come on.

272
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:44,305
You do it.

273
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:15,344
Miss Lin.

274
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:17,785
No bosses

275
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,224
want their employees
to know everything about them.

276
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:21,905
So no matter what you do,

277
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:23,425
I won't let you join Letao.

278
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:25,065
Sorry.

279
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:28,185
I admit I used some tricks.

280
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:32,945
But doesn't that show how much
I desire and strive for this job?

281
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,704
Don't be fooled
by the misattribution of arousal.

282
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:37,545
You tried it and should know

283
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,704
it doesn't work, right?

284
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:41,584
Good night.

285
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:45,824
You're back.

286
00:14:58,545 --> 00:14:59,464
(Congratulations.)

287
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,624
(Male Lead's fondness
toward you has increased,)

288
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:03,065
(currently at ten percent.)

289
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:03,824
(Keep it up!)

290
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:06,025
(Establish a work connection
with Gao Haiming.)

291
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:07,785
Why did you deny it?

292
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,425
This proves
the misattribution of arousal works.

293
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,185
Establish a work connection...

294
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:16,744
How?

295
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,025
He won't even hire me.

296
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:23,265
What did the book say?

297
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,504
(Seems like joining
a company called Yunsheng.)

298
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,224
Huan'er, don't you go to bed?

299
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:37,065
I have to work hard

300
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:38,945
and get into Yunsheng PR Dept.

301
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:44,425
You work so hard.

302
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,785
I think you'll definitely succeed.

303
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,425
I'm going to bed now.

304
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,344
Good night.

305
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,824
(Due to your great effort,)

306
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:21,425
(you're awarded with a gift pack.)

307
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:26,785
No sanitary pads!

308
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,056
(Yunsheng Tower)

309
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,344
First, research
these companies thoroughly.

310
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,864
No need to handle the proposal now.

311
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:40,945
Wait, what happened?

312
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:43,624
A bug occurred?

313
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:44,624
Hello.

314
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:46,665
(Due to your efforts,)

315
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:48,665
(you're rewarded with accelerated plot.)

316
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,265
(You have joined Yunsheng
as a PR specialist.)

317
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,065
(Keep it up!)

318
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,265
Ridiculous!

319
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:55,945
Who needs this kind of

320
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,425
accelerated plot?

321
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:58,984
If you had any sincerity,

322
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,864
just max out the fondness.

323
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,945
Why didn't you
accelerate plot last night?

324
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,064
I object.

325
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:06,504
Stand up.

326
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:08,704
Object to what?

327
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:10,024
Lin Huan'er, don't forget

328
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:11,504
you're still on probation.

329
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:12,704
No.

330
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,072
(Xiang Lingling, PR Dept Manager)

331
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,105
Ma'am Xiang.

332
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,304
I think

333
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,304
these tasks lack challenge.

334
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:24,425
I want to take over challenging tasks.

335
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,064
First, address me as Ms. Xiang.

336
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:31,145
Don't try to flatter me.

337
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:34,224
Second, given your resume,

338
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:38,304
I think collaborating with these
companies is already challenging to you.

339
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:44,544
First, Yunsheng already collaborated
with the first two companies.

340
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,704
Just maintain routine relations
with them.

341
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:48,264
But this one,

342
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:51,024
Kelv is a recent contact,

343
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,304
producing skincare products.

344
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:56,625
But as a small brand, they might
get disputes on quality control

345
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,264
and have minor issues.

346
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,464
I think we can use this
to push cooperation.

347
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,905
You've done your prep work well.

348
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:08,625
Then give me the cooperation proposal
for Kelv

349
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,784
before getting off work.

350
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:11,024
By myself?

351
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:13,064
Stand up.

352
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:15,665
Out!

353
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:24,984
Lin Huan'er, here you are.

354
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:25,905
Make 20 copies of this.

355
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:28,625
Why staring at me?

356
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,385
Go now!

357
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:30,544
I'm swamped!

358
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:33,145
Mr. Wang.

359
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:34,064
Okay.

360
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,665
Let me help, Lin Huan'er.

361
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,345
You... No need.

362
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,185
You are?

363
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,304
Wang Zhen.

364
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:41,464
Thank you.

365
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:42,264
You're so kind.

366
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:46,784
You can still smile
after seeing Xiang Lingling?

367
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,264
Impressive!

368
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:53,585
I've seen someone meaner than her.

369
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:54,704
This is nothing.

370
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:57,625
Ms. Xiang has been in a bad mood lately.

371
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,105
Don't provoke her.

372
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:01,784
Why is she in a bad mood?

373
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:05,024
Because the boss ordered her
to secure the Letao order.

374
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,185
She's worried about it.

375
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:07,984
Letao?

376
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:09,105
Yes.

377
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:12,224
Letao is approaching
various PR companies.

378
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,544
I bet something's going on
behind the scenes,

379
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,304
but can't find any leads.

380
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,185
Make way!

381
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,504
Move! Make way!

382
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:23,744
Go forward!

383
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,024
Don't block my way!

384
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:25,825
Okay?

385
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:27,665
So sorry!

386
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,744
Way too rude!

387
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:29,504
Come on.

388
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:32,936
(Who's he?)

389
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:33,928
(Fang Yuan.)

390
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,464
(Fang Yuan?)

391
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:36,808
(Fang)

392
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:38,536
(Yuan.)

393
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,456
(Yuan.)

394
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,665
(He's the boss.)

395
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:42,784
(What?)
God blesses me.

396
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:44,385
(He's the boss?)
Wish me wealth.

397
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,064
(Boss.)
God blesses me. Thank you.

398
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:46,792
(Him?)

399
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,385
(Boss.)

400
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:49,385
Stay calm.

401
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:51,905
(Okay.)
Okay?

402
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,145
- I...
- What are you doing here?

403
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,784
- This is...
- It's work hours.

404
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:57,145
- Yes.
- Back to work!

405
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:58,544
- Got it.
- Absurd!

406
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,264
Listen, everyone.

407
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:02,224
Year-end is coming.

408
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:03,704
You must work hard.

409
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:05,105
Don't waste time!

410
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,984
Upgrade to a big company by year-end!

411
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,704
Get pumped up! Understand?

412
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,264
Okay?

413
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,304
Okay.

414
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:13,544
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:15,185
Okay?

416
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:16,905
Okay.

417
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:17,865
Go for it! Hurry.

418
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,105
Give me the documents.

419
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,105
Be quick.

420
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:27,345
The last issue of Star and Firefly
performed exceptionally well.

421
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:30,665
It's currently ranked in the top three
for magazine serialized comic sales.

422
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:35,345
Besides, we've received
many letters and gifts from fans.

423
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:37,945
Also, the Market Editorial Department
conducted research.

424
00:20:38,264 --> 00:20:41,784
They found that Star and Firefly
are still everyone's favorite couple.

425
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,945
Although their story is a bit rocky

426
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:46,585
and it's a mismatched romance,

427
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,865
that's what makes it so captivating.

428
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:51,825
So...

429
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:54,945
So...

430
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:58,064
So the Market Editorial Department
has decided

431
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,704
once the serialization ends,

432
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,105
they'd publish a standalone volume
of Star and Firefly.

433
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:04,984
Really? Fantastic!

434
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:06,945
Back when we were selecting topics,

435
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:07,984
I already

436
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,024
had high hopes for it.

437
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:10,105
Miss Mengmeng,

438
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:12,304
you haven't been
in the industry for long,

439
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,945
but you're quite talented
and unconstrained.

440
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:17,224
It proves my judgment was accurate.

441
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:19,385
Thank you.

442
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:24,825
About the proposal and outline
for There He/She Comes,

443
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,345
I've already reviewed them thoroughly.

444
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,064
But I think

445
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:32,425
if the whole story just revolves
around the friendship between two girls,

446
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:34,825
it might feel a bit prosaic.

447
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:36,425
No problem.

448
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,625
I can add romantic storylines for them.

449
00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:40,464
That's exactly what I want.

450
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,984
Then we've reached a consensus.

451
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:44,865
I'll leave then.

452
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:48,345
By the way,

453
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:50,544
submit the draft soon.

454
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:52,224
Don't worry.

455
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,224
Hello, Huan'er.

456
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:04,504
Huan'er, you really get me.

457
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:06,185
My comic is getting a standalone volume.

458
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:08,585
I was thinking
of going shopping to celebrate.

459
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,464
No problem.

460
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:10,945
I'll cover everything.

461
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:15,304
Whoever you are,

462
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,464
get off Huan'er right now!

463
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:19,425
Don't be so dramatic.

464
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,585
Was I that stingy before?

465
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:24,105
You always said to spend money wisely,

466
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,304
and to save it for Xiaojue.

467
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,585
I was really foolish before.

468
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:35,865
Huan'er,

469
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:36,984
are you okay?

470
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,304
You don't seem quite yourself.

471
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:39,425
Do you have a fever?

472
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:40,825
Let's see a doctor.

473
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:42,345
No need.

474
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:43,224
Let's have a splurge.

475
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:44,504
What?

476
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:46,185
Who's paying it?

477
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:54,704
Xiaojue loves their clothes the most.

478
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:57,984
So?

479
00:22:58,425 --> 00:22:59,304
Have you forgotten?

480
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,585
You used your first paycheck

481
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:03,905
to buy clothes from them for him.

482
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:11,504
Over here.

483
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:14,425
This one suits you.

484
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:15,625
Suits me?

485
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:17,064
Okay.

486
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:18,784
How does this look on me?

487
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
Very understated. It suits you.

488
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,345
What?

489
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:57,064
- Take mine.
- Alright.

490
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,105
- Alright.
- You've paid.

491
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,145
- Alright.
- Hope to see you again.

492
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,304
Okay, thanks.

493
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:02,385
Let's go.

494
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:06,385
Feels great.

495
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:07,625
We got the clothes.

496
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,304
Then let's go buy some bags.

497
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:10,865
Still buying?

498
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:11,665
Yes.

499
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,425
Mengmeng, have you heard

500
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:14,865
that bags cure all illness?

501
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:16,185
And honestly,

502
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:18,464
money in this world
is like game coins to me.

503
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:19,464
It is quite useless.

504
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:21,064
(I've used up my living expenses.)

505
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:22,264
(Last time, you)

506
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:23,385
- (transferred me VND 10,000.)
- Who is it?

507
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:23,825
It's okay.

508
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:25,064
- Don't mind him.
- (I know you're acting out.)

509
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:25,784
Let's go buy bags.

510
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:26,625
(You're living a tough life.)

511
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,185
You...

512
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:28,264
Stop buying.

513
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,905
Listen, I'll buy you whatever you like.

514
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:32,784
You'd use up Xiaojue's living expenses

515
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:33,905
for next month.

516
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,704
Mengmeng, what does he
have anything to do with...

517
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:40,825
Well, he has something to do with me.

518
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:42,304
But think about it.

519
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:45,145
I transferred him
10,000 yuan not long ago.

520
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:47,984
10,000 yuan?

521
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,185
Yes, that's a lot.

522
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:50,865
He must be living very comfortably now,

523
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,945
so don't worry.

524
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,105
Let's go buy bags.

525
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:55,385
Then you still spent so much today?

526
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:00,665
Let's go.

527
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:06,224
Is it a photo sticker booth?

528
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,544
(Creating memories)
I haven't taken these in ages.

529
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,024
Let's take a set.

530
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:09,984
Let's go.

531
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:12,744
(Prepare for shooting)

532
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,928
(Look up at the camera)

533
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:24,425
So cute.

534
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:25,744
So cute.

535
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,665
(Letao Tower)

536
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:29,544
(Letao's agency market share)
The market share of Beikeke diapers

537
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,464
(in the first half of the year)
under Lovebaby been dropping.

538
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:33,704
Our agents are barely making any profit.

539
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:37,105
- Shall we stop importing it?
- Why?

540
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:38,665
For two reasons.

541
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:41,865
First, the domestic spokesperson's
reputation has declined.

542
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:43,464
Second, the product quality

543
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:45,425
hasn't been upgraded properly.

544
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,064
Any good suggestions?

545
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:51,425
I suggest we stop importing it

546
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,585
and urge Lovebaby to make adjustments.

547
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:54,905
I agree.

548
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:58,984
Well, continue importing it

549
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:01,304
and increase the promotional budget.

550
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:03,544
Mr. Huang.

551
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,744
Get these done.

552
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:09,464
First, remove news related to Beikeke's
original spokesperson and the products.

553
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:13,105
Second, contact the manufacturer
to prepare for the second-phase upgrade.

554
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:14,504
Yes, but...

555
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:15,984
That's it. Meeting adjourned.

556
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:27,865
Everything's going well.

557
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:31,024
We're negotiating with raw material
sites and processing plants.

558
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:32,145
We strive

559
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:33,464

and indifferent on the surface,

too busy with work,

- Who told you to do so?
- Here's the thing.

644
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:29,145
I heard our company's bidding
for long-term cooperation with Letao,

645
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,744
so I did some research.

646
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:34,425
I discovered Beikeke under Letao
is losing market share rapidly,

647

this might be an opportunity.

Wait, how about
reviewing my proposal first?

652
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:47,425
If you approve it,

653
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:49,064
I can deliver it to Letao now.

I told you to,

I'm afraid it's not polished enough.

672

677
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,224
I'll deliver it.

678
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:19,224
Don't worry. If it succeeds,
