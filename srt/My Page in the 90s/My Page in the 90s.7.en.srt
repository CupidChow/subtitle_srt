=Episode 7=

12
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,576
By the way, Mr. Gao.

13
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:49,690
No need to count.

14
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,592
Not a penny less.

15
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:13,690
(Oh, no!)

16
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,850
(How did he hear)

17
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,811
(I offended his dad?)

18
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,610
(It's forcing a misunderstanding.)

19
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,051
(I can't believe this.)

20
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:22,811
Mr. Gao.

21
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:23,610
Wait a moment.

22
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,288
Okay.

23
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,730
You heard everything.

24
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,850
What kind of woman is she, exactly?

25
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,610
She's just a vain woman.

26
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,450
What she wants

27
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,211
is much more than you imagine.

28
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:49,890
I don't understand.

29
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,730
Why would you like such a woman?

30
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:55,331
Mr. Chairman,

31
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,211
she's just a woman
you've met once or twice.

32
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,771
Yet she knew you only
solve problems with money.

33
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
Isn't it obvious enough?

34
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,651
In this world,

35
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,811
95% of the problems

36
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,371
can be solved with money.

37
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,130
Only the remaining 5%

38
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,690
are unsolvable.

39
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:15,931
I have to go.

40
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:30,971
How much of that conversation
did you hear just now?

41
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,531
I heard it all.

42
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:34,931
All... Just now...

43
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,651
About today,

44
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,290
I hope you don't mind.

45
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:41,170
I was worried you might mind.

46
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:45,410
I just can't agree with some

47
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,491
of your father's actions,

48
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,570
so I couldn't help saying a bit more.

49
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,450
When Letao ran into trouble back then,

50
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,690
it was my mother's dowry

51
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,971
that saved the business.

52
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,416
Of course.

53
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,730
My mother's family
also needed Letao's help.

54
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,570
The marriage brought Letao

55
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,170
to where it is today.

56
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,331
So in my father's mind,

57
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:07,850
a strong alliance

58
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,091
is what sustains a family

59
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,450
and keeps it prosperous.

60
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,850
If he's thinking like a businessman,

61
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:17,451
a marriage alliance

62
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:18,451
for mutual gain,

63
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,571
I can understand.

64
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,370
But what do you think?

65
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,011
What do you think?

66
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:30,170
I don't think you would
sacrifice your marriage to trade

67
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,571
for the company's development.

68
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,131
Your view of love and marriage

69
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,891
is still a fantasy.

70
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:43,771
More or less.

71
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,331
By the way, some of what I said today

72
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,211
was on the spot.

73
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,290
- You...
- It's okay.

74
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:51,930
Still, thank you.

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,891
Let's go.

76
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:54,531
Where to?

77
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,571
I'll take you home.

78
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,571
Congratulations! So far,

79
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,691
Male Lead's fondness
toward you is soaring.

80
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,451
It's currently 38%.

81
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,011
38%?

82
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,984
(Currently 38%)

83
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,290
That's a qualitative leap.

84
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:42,280
(Business Hall)

85
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,050
(If he's thinking like a businessman,)

86
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:48,810
a marriage alliance

87
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,730
for mutual gain,

88
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,571
I can understand.

89
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,451
I don't think you would
sacrifice your marriage to trade

90
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,810
for the company's development.

91
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,771
You're back, Huan'er.

92
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,131
Look.

93
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,011
Sauerkraut Fish.

94
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,211
Dad's special.

95
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:16,370
Smells good.

96
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,410
Oh, there's one more.

97
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,170
It's okay. No need.

98
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,810
Don't make it.

99
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,971
I must make it.

100
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:23,011
Your favorite Sweet and Sour Ribs.

101
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:23,971
- Almost done.
- It's okay.

102
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,810
Really no need.

103
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,730
I can't finish it.

104
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,651
Huan'er, just let Dad make it.

105
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,850
How long have you been away?

106
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,810
How long?

107
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,170
You've forgotten?

108
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,331
Are you're still angry with Dad?

109
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,331
Why?

110
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:02,610
Dad.

111
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,571
What are you doing? Go to sleep.

112
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,091
Lately, Xiaojue is short on money.

113
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,490
I have to go to work.

114
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,610
Don't bring up Xiaojue to me anymore.

115
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,131
For him, you worked
from dawn to dusk every day.

116
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,170
You didn't even sleep.

117
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,451
Your body will collapse!

118
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:17,451
It's fine, Dad.

119
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,131
I-I'll be fine in a few days.

120
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,011
Will you listen?

121
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,370
Will you listen? I...

122
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:29,531
(Let me tell you.)

123
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,011
Back then, for that Ou Xiaojue,

124
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:32,211
you worked three jobs a day.

125
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,810
You were exhausted.

126
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,451
Dad was so angry at the time,

127
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:37,810
so he slapped you.

128
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,331
Huan'er, here.

129
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,050
Huan'er, listen.

130
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,571
Later, Dad regretted it so much.

131
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,170
He just cared about his pride,

132
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,891
so he never apologized.

133
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:55,651
He did the right thing.

134
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:58,370
But it wasn't hard enough, was it?

135
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,290
He should've hit both sides.

136
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,971
This, that.

137
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,312
Huan'er, you...

138
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,131
Here you are, my girls.

139
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:06,971
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

140
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:09,736
Come.

141
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,930
It's okay, Dad, I'll do it.

142
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,930
I don't have to work so many jobs now.

143
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,771
Let me help.

144
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,971
There's also soup.

145
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,211
Nice.

146
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,011
Tomato and Egg Soup.

147
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:25,850
Put it here.

148
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,691
- Here, come on.
- Sit now.

149
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:28,691
Put it here.

150
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,451
This is both of your favorites.

151
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:34,411
Here, try some.

152
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,130
All your things are still the same.

153
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:41,850
No one dared to touch them.

154
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:43,291
That's not true!

155
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,211
You threw away
all of Ou Xiaojue's stuff.

156
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,091
Didn't I go looking for it afterward?

157
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,250
The garbage collectors
had already taken it away.

158
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,691
I can vouch for that.

159
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,250
You even searched the trash bins.

160
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,691
Came back covered in dirt.

161
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,250
Useless things should be thrown away.

162
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,171
Why look for it?

163
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:02,650
What's wrong?

164
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:04,850
It's fine.

165
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,250
I don't know why those people

166
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,571
came to our house today.

167
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,291
But you're definitely in trouble.

168
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,091
(Property Deed)
This is our property deed.

169
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,770
If push comes to shove, mortgage it.

170
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:28,890
Pay them back first.

171
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:33,490
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,770
Dad's worried
you can't repay loan sharks.

173
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,610
Huan'er, just take it.

174
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,130
I've gotten used to living here.

175
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,530
It's time for a change.

176
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,730
I-I didn't borrow from loan sharks.

177
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,650
I just...

178
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,291
It's hard to explain in a few words.

179
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,650
It's alright.

180
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:54,811
Today,

181
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,610
I want to make things clear to you.

182
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,130
The old Lin Huan'er

183
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,171
is dead.

184
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:02,691
Don't say "dead"! It's bad luck.

185
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:03,490
Okay, fine.

186
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,211
Not dead.

187
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,571
It's just a figure of speech.

188
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,610
I'm brand-new now.

189
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,091
Okay?

190
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,890
From now on, I'll love myself more.

191
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:14,571
I won't spend

192
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,451
another cent

193
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:17,171
on men,

194
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:19,010
especially that Ou... Whatever.

195
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,811
Huan'er, hearing you say that

196
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,010
makes me so happy.

197
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,331
You finally came around.

198
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:29,850
- Enough.
- Should've happened sooner.

199
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:31,571
Go to bed early.

200
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,331
Dad, take the deed back.

201
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,890
You keep it. Be good.

202
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,130
You keep it.

203
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:41,890
Listen to me.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,832
(Property Deed)

205
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,091
Go to bed now.

206
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:51,691
Go to bed now, Dad.

207
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,091
Time to sleep.

208
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,130
Huan'er,

209
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,811
you're not yourself.

210
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,411
How so?

211
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,610
You are Lin Huan'er?

212
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,370
Of course. Who else would I look like?

213
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,770
Time to sleep.

214
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,530
Huan'er, can I squeeze in with you?

215
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:23,650
Okay.

216
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,211
Huan'er, this time you came back,

217
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,811
I feel you've completely changed.

218
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:33,291
Maybe it's because people keep growing.

219
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,370
Will you come back again in the future?

220
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:42,010
Do you want me to come back often?

221
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:42,931
Of course!

222
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,250
I promise you.

223
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,250
I'll visit often and stay with you.

224
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,091
Okay.

225
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:51,931
Just sleep.

226
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,650
Not cold, right?

227
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,130
Hold on.

228
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,811
What's my birthday?

229
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,848
I'll turn off the light.

230
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:25,451
Mom.

231
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,051
Wait.

232
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,171
You're not going anywhere today.

233
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,130
Mr. Xie and his family
will be here soon.

234
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,650
I've got commitments, Mr. Chairman.

235
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,691
Cancel all your commitments.

236
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:58,890
Chairman Gao.

237
00:12:58,971 --> 00:12:59,490
They're here.

238
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,331
Mr. Xie has arrived.

239
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,971
Gao.

240
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,971
Welcome, Xie.

241
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:02,530
Mr. Xie.

242
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,211
Mr. Xie, welcome.

243
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,250
- Hello.
- Mr. Gao.

244
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,010
Xie,

245
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,931
your daughter gets more beautiful.

246
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,091
Mrs. Gao.

247
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,250
Come, have a seat.

248
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:11,850
Haiming.

249
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,490
Come on.

250
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,890
I got you a gift.

251
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,571
See if you like it.

252
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:24,770
About that day,

253
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,291
I know you didn't mean it.

254
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,291
What is it? Let me see too.

255
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,850
Mrs. Gao,

256
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:35,010
it's a watch I picked for Haiming.

257
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:38,411
Wanjun, you're so thoughtful.

258
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,250
Thank you, Wanjun.

259
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:41,610
You're welcome.

260
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:42,691
Alright.

261
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,931
Wait here for a moment.

262
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,931
I want Haiming to help me pick a gown.

263
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:48,811
Be right back.

264
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,650
Okay.

265
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,250
Mr. Xie, please sit.

266
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,451
Okay, go ahead.

267
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,490
Excuse me.

268
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,211
Come, Wanjun.

269
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,130
Sit.

270
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:01,931
Okay.

271
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,250
Haiming.

272
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:16,490
Here's the thing.

273
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:20,691
If you feel uncomfortable
or out of place,

274
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,051
listen to my advice.

275
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,130
Don't force yourself
to endure anything for anyone's sake.

276
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,811
You can leave anytime.

277
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:41,770
(To Lin Huan'er)

278
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,411
Huan'er, something for you at reception.

279
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:45,051
It's from a phone store.

280
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:45,931
A gift for you.

281
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,530
For me?

282
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:49,010
(To Lin Huan'er)
It has your name on it.

283
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,130
How cute!

284
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,010
Something's up!

285
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,451
Who sent it?

286
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,971
Do I look like I know?

287
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,691
Fair point.

288
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,091
It's really beautiful.

289
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:08,931
(Saved Contact: M12363552036)

290
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,451
M? M...

291
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,850
Mengmeng?

292
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,770
Oh, my Mengmeng!

293
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,890
Knowing I need a phone,
she sent me one. So sweet.

294
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,811
Such a cute one!

295
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,650
She even saved her contact in it.

296
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,130
Xie, I know you're busy with work,

297
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,250
always tied up.

298
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,091
Remember those fine wines
I saved for you?

299
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:31,730
You've never had time to try them.

300
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,610
Today's gathering is perfect for it.

301
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,770
Yeah, you've mentioned it several times.

302
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:38,770
Let's finish them off today!

303
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,650
Mr. Gao.

304
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,730
Sorry to interrupt.

305
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:44,971
I need to give Haiming his phone.

306
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,211
Okay, go ahead.

307
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,091
He's upstairs.

308
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,250
Okay.

309
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,890
I think they two

310
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,091
make a good match.

311

(Incoming Call: Lin Huan'er)

312
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:04,051
Hello?

313
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:06,211
Hello, Mengmeng. I got the phone.

314
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,530
It's so cute. I love it so much!

315
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,370
Thank you so much!

316
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:11,211
Lin Huan'er,
why do I see you everywhere?

317
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,811
Who are you?

318
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,211
Who gave you that phone?

319
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,091
Haiming gave you a phone?

320
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,890
Did Haiming give me the phone?

321
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,370
Who do you think you are
to get a phone from Haiming?

322
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,530
How can you answer Haiming's phone?

323
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,691
That's a violation of privacy, you know?

324
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,811
He's my fiancé.

325
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,890
Of course, I can answer his phone.

326
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,211
Right now,

327
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:36,530
our parents are finalizing
engagement plans.

328
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,250
Haiming couldn't get away.

329
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,610
So I answered for him.

330
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,130
Engagement?

331
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:47,610
Yes.

332
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,051
I told you long ago

333
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,211
that Haiming and I

334
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,691
are destined for each other.

335
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:58,530
Zhen, I'm leaving.

336
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,130
Where to?

337
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,370
To reclaim my main quest.

338
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:04,611
Okay.

339
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,330
Haiming is exceptional.

340
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,330
He's the son-in-law I envision.

341
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,010
Once you're engaged,

342
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,171
don't dwell on that girl.

343
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,250
Focus your attention on Haiming.

344
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,490
I'll handle

345
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,451
everything else for you,

346
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:25,611
okay?

347
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,290
It's been too long
since I saw Xie last time.

348
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,611
Today, Xie and his daughter

349
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,851
are visiting our home.

350
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,530
For us,

351
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,971
I think they are truly honored guests.

352
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:46,851
His visit is a rare occasion.

353
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,931
Haiming, chat more with Mr. Xie

354
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:51,611
and Wanjun.

355
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,211
You're always like a log.

356
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:55,691
What are you doing?

357
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,810
Haiming is exceptional.

358
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,050
He's good.

359
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,891
Master Haiming seems

360
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:04,451
to have zero interest in Miss Xie.

361
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,570
What the master is thinking?

362
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:07,570
His intentions

363
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:08,971
are beyond our guesswork.

364
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:19,371
Haiming,

365
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,090
your phone rang earlier.

366
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,536
Thanks.

367
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:28,411
Mr. Chairman,

368
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,971
I have matters to attend to.

369
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,530
Sorry, you go ahead.

370
00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:32,211
Excuse me.

371
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,250
Let's begin without him.

372
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,250
Please.

373
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,411
Gao Haiming?

374
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,451
Gao Haiming?

375
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,050
Gao Haiming?

376
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,691
Why are you here?

377
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,490
Aren't these my shoes?

378
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,090
I asked why you're at my house.

379
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,050
As I heard about your engagement.

380
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:41,411
Just for this?

381
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,530
I'm here to rescue you from this mess.

382
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,891
How do you know it's a mess?

383
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,371
Because I think

384
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,810
you wouldn't marry for business.

385
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,451
You care deeply?

386
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:01,971
Why give me a phone?

387
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:03,411
For convenience.

388
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,530
We have business dealings.

389
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,611
That's all?

390
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:09,451
Answer my question first.

391
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,851
Why rush here when you heard

392
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:12,931
about my engagement?

393
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,411
Because I don't want you
engaged to others.

394
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,651
Whether it's arranged dates,
a relationship, or marriage,

395
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,411
I want you to know

396
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:29,611
it won't be real love for you.

397
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,570
Haiming.

398
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:38,290
Haiming.

399
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:42,050
Haiming.

400
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,490
Want her gone for good?

401
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,730
Haiming.

402
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:54,770
Don't move.

403
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,250
Haiming.

404
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,490
Are you in there?

405
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:00,971
I need to talk to you.

406
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,392
♪I woke up in a strange place♪

407
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:14,632
♪The sunlight here is blindingly bright♪

408
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:21,032
♪Pages rustle, and I hear a loud voice♪

409
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,611
I'm coming in.

410
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,250
Haiming,

411
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,090
what are you doing?

412
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,290
Lin Huan'er?

413
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:42,131
Miss Xie,

414
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,171
this is why I can't
get engaged with you.

415
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,211
Please leave.

416
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,250
Just you wait!

417
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:06,851
T-That solved it permanently.

418
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,090
You should go too.

419
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,171
Can I take these shoes?

420
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,570
Gao Haiming.

421
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,490
What exactly do you mean?

422
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,211
Do you realize
that with your outburst today,

423
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,611
our cooperation with Fuchuang Company

424
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:37,371
has become completely impossible?

425
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:38,810
Has that Lin Huan'er

426
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,851
bewitched you?

427
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,971
If you insist on this,

428
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,691
tomorrow I'll have the company

429
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,451
terminate the partnership with Yunsheng.

430
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,570
You're forbidden to see her from now on.

431
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:49,530
Mr. Chairman,

432
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:52,050
this has nothing to do with anyone else.

433
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,611
No matter what you do,

434
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:55,570
I will not marry Xie Wanjun.

435
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,250
Are you determined to destroy Letao?

436
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:04,330
Do you know

437
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,250
what kind of situation
Letao is in right now?

438
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,050
Do you know that?

439
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,371
I'm fully aware.

440
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,290
That's why I seek transformation.

441
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,090
Just give me some time.

442
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,891
I will surely solve
Letao's current crisis.

443
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:16,171
Give you some time?

444
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,330
What kind of time?

445
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,851
You will surely?

446
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:22,810
Just based on these flimsy words?

447
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,971
Can you really guarantee the jobs

448
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,530
of over 1,000 Letao employees?

449
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,730
I gave Letao to you.

450
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,651
Because you've never lost Letao.

451
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,730
I did.

452
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,171
I saved Letao and brought it back.

453
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,891
So I know how difficult it is.

454
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,891
Do you understand?

455
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,730
A few words from you

456
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,971
can solve the problem?

457
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,851
Impossible!

458
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,451
And that girl.

459
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,730
You must cut ties with her.

460
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,730
Otherwise, get out of this house!

461
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,010
Mr. Chairman.

462
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,411
Letao is your life's work.

463
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,211
It's mine too.

464
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:08,090
Since childhood,

465
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:11,330
I've always acted according
to your demands and standards.

466
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,451
But starting today,

467
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,770
I will only act
according to my own will.

468
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:23,290
Gao Haiming!

469
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,490
Come on, Xie.

470
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,530
Have a seat.

471
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,730
No need to be polite. This is your turf.

472
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,090
Just relax.

473
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,010
Don't draw such a clear line between us.

474
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:50,010
I can tell you're still furious.

475
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:53,490
Look, we have been friends
for so many years.

476
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:56,770
We shouldn't let the kids' issues
ruin our friendship,

477
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,330
right?

478
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:59,770
I don't deserve
to be called your friend.

479
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,211
Haiming pulled such a stunt.

480
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,770
What's that supposed to mean?

481
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,770
Xie,

482
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,330
it's true I failed
to discipline Haiming properly.

483
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:12,250
But you know, he's young.

484
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,530
He does foolish things.

485
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,691
- For an adult...
- He's already hiding a lover.

486
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,570
And you call it foolishness?

487
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,810
We are all adults.

488
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,611
We know what matters
and what doesn't in life and business.

489
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,651
However, Wanjun and I
respect Haiming's choice.

490
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,971
Xie, how about this?

491
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:37,810
After Letao's new product launches,

492
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,770
on top of the original contract terms,

493
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,851
I'll concede an extra 3% to you.

494
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:44,451
This is my way of showing sincerity,

495
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,611
my apology.

496
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,530
Gao, do you think I need those 3%?

497
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,131
I know you certainly don't.

498
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,090
Isn't this my way of showing sincerity?

499
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:58,971
Rest assured. Regarding this,

500
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:00,971
I will have Haiming
give Wanjun an explanation.

501
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:02,570
Enough said.

502
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,971
Though I value wealth,

503
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,290
I only have this one daughter.

504
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,570
Anyone who makes Wanjun unhappy

505
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:12,490
is my enemy.

506
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,250
We'll talk about cooperation
another time.

507
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:19,611
Xie.

508
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,090
Xie.

509
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,931

00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:46,570
Okay, thanks.

513
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,010
I see you don't have shoes.

514
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,611
I happen to have a pair here.

515
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,490
Wear these for now.

516
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,530
Thank you.

No need.

549
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:02,971
You should be off work soon, right?

Chenghua Road. Urgent.

He's at the next intersection.

563
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:38,330
Just wait a bit in the car.

564
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,691
I'll take a taxi myself.

565
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:49,691
Mengmeng.

566
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:50,530
Be careful, Mengmeng.

567
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:52,651
Well... Stay safe.

568
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,611
Don't worry, I'll take care of your car.

569
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:06,536
Hello?

570
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,530
Huan'er,

571
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:09,851
that Silly Goose is driving me crazy!

572
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,530
My car broke down
right where he was on duty.

573
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,010
Even the car was smart enough.

574
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,451
He was dense enough
to get someone else to drive me!

575
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,010
Isn't it infuriating?

576
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,171
Mengmeng,

577
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,250
do you really have to fixate

578
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,691
on Hu Tiehan?

579
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:26,611
Don't give up the entire forest
for just one tree.

580
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,010
The world is vast.

581
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,171
Go out and explore!

582
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:31,611
Then could you bear
to give up on Xiaojue?

583
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:34,851
Anyone who wants him can have him.

584
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,290
What is it? I want it too.

585
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,730
I suggest you calm down.

586
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,050
It's not anything good.

587
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:41,691
That makes sense.

588
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:42,651
Then I quit.

589
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:48,050
There aren't many good things.

590
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,611
Why hasn't

591
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:51,250
Gao Haiming made any move?

592
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,131
Got it. Looks like I have
to take the initiative again.

593
00:30:59,048 --> 00:30:59,592
(Letao Tower)

594
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,490
Fuchuang has already secured contracts
with some of the agency brands

595
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,010
before your company's renewal period.

596
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,090
(Corporate Equity Acquisition Contract)
Some remaining brands have decided.

597
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,651
And there are very few left
under negotiation.

598
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:16,691
Miss Xie, please speak plainly.

599
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,611
Letao and Fuchuang
have cooperated for many years.

600
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:22,211
But as things stand now,

601
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,691
a merger is inevitable.

602
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,371
Fuchuang acquiring 60% of Letao's shares

603
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,891
would actually be beneficial for Letao's

604
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,250
long-term development.

605
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,770
Mr. Gao, you should reconsider.

606
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,651
After all, it is a major decision.

607
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:38,570
It requires your careful consideration.

608
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:42,371
But for Letao,

609
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,131
there doesn't seem
to be a better choice.

610
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,810
Then I won't bother you.

611
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,171
Compared to me,

612
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,451
you need more time to think.

613
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:02,651
I'll await your call.

614
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:06,490
Take care.

615
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:18,371
Mr. Gao, it's confirmed.

616
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,810
Mr. Du, the Chief Engineer
of the R&D department,

617
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,570
and his team submitted
their resignations.

618
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,371
Just when you negotiated with Miss Xie.

619
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,090
It was my oversight.

620
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,032
They must've made some moves
long before.

621
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,290
They're cutting off options

622
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,090
to force compliance.

623
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,290
Other R&D staff will work as usual

624
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,090
with a fivefold attendance bonus.

625
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,490
Post job openings.

626
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:37,611
Organize interviews.

627
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:38,651
Besides,

628
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,250
compile a list
of raw materials experts for me.

629
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:42,312
Go.

630
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,010
Really?

631
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,250
Why are you surprised?

632
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,171
On the surface, it's Xie Wanjun
from Fuchuang

633
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,171
likes Gao Haiming.

634
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,651
(Fuchuang - Miss Xie)
So they promoted a marriage alliance.

635
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:05,371
(Miss Xie - Gao Haiming,
Letao - Gao Haiming)

636
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,250
But actually,

637
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,530
Fuchuang has long wanted
to acquire Letao.

638
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,570
Now, Fuchuang should have snatched

639
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,384
half of Letao's
product distribution rights.

640
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,010
Isn't it clearly using Gao Haiming
as leverage

641
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,171
to seize Letao's market share?

642
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:21,490
A diversionary tactic.

643
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,464
(Gao Haiming)

644
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,891
Didn't see that coming, Mengmeng.

645
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,050
You're clueless about relationships,

646
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,651
but in business analysis,

647
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:30,810
you're spot on.

648
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,851
Growing up watching
these power struggles,

649
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,490
I've seen through it long ago.

650
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:37,651
I just didn't care.

651
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:41,851
Now, it seems

652
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:43,770
Gao Haiming might be in trouble.

653
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,256
(Gao Haiming)

654
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,131
So far, 16 of Letao's agency brands

655
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,171
have reached agreements

656
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:54,090
with us.

657
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:56,931
Six more brands plan
to switch to Fuchuang

658
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,371
after contract expiration.

659
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,411
Only 17 brands remain undecided

660
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,010
about cooperation with us.

661
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:05,171
Alright, you may leave.

662
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:08,610
I'd like to see

663
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:10,490
how he turns this situation around.

664
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,451
We just poached

665
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,291
Letao's core R&D team.

666
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,851
Yet their production line plans

667
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,891
seem unaffected.

668
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,210
So what?

669
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,371
They couldn't even hold the market share

670
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:24,530
for brand-name products.

671
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:26,210
For a newly developed brand,

672
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:27,931
can it really make an impact?

673
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,610
Don't underestimate him.

674
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,490
This Mr. Gao has some skills.

675
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:42,771
Hello?

676
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,771
I see.

677
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:50,610
My guess was correct.

678
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,130
They hired Dr. Liu's team

679
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,731
for technical support.

680
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,811
It seems he's still fighting.

681
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:01,331
Be patient.

682
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,291
Signed contracts can be broken.

683
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,050
