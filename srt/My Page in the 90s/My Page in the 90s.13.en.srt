=Episode 13=

12
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,630
Why am I so unlucky?

13
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,110
Hello.

14
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,750
Xiaojue, it's Mengmeng.

15
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,591
Mengmeng, what is it?

16
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,190
I acted impulsively that day.

17
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,831
After hearing the truth from Tiehan,

18
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,711
I realized I had misunderstood you.

19
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,311
It's fine.

20
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:17,950
Just a misunderstanding.

21
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,750
Actually,
I've thought it over carefully.

22
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,950
This isn't

23
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,991
entirely Huan'er's fault.

24
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,031
Hey, Mengmeng, are you there?

25
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:32,790
(Forgive me?)

26
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,670
Yes, I'm here.

27
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,871
Can you forgive me?

28
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,431
Mengmeng, what do you mean?

29
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,431
Don't mention that.

30
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,591
We've acquainted for years,

31
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,670
just let bygones be bygones, okay?

32
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,111
(Ask him out)
Good then.

33
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,151
Here's the thing.

34
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,391
It's been a long time

35
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,031
since we graduated and gathered.

36
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,431
We're going to host a class reunion.

37
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,670
Can you come?

38
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:56,031
I...

39
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:59,230
I want to ask if Huan'er...

40
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:00,871
She...

41
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,431
(I'm dead)
Don't care about her!

42
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,991
After what she's done,

43
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:07,670
I don't want

44
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,790
to care about her anyway.

45
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:12,111
Just think of it

46
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,551
as a chance
to apologize to you in person.

47
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,950
Mengmeng, I just got back

48
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,031
and I'm quite busy.

49
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:22,630
And, I'm not in a good mood.

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,670
(Flattery)
You're not in a good mood?

51
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,151
You know what?

52
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:31,950
You're the most successful person

53
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,591
in our class.

54
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,271
And everyone knows

55
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,711
you and I are close,

56
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:39,711
so they told me
I have to ask you to come.

57
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:41,750
(Flattery)
If you don't come,

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,470
I'll be embarrassed.

59
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,111
Mengmeng, you know Huan'er and I

60
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:50,831
just broke up.

61
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,591
If she shows up,

62
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,910
it would be awkward.

63
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,470
Just let her come if she doesn't
care about the embarrassment.

64
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,991
Tiehan and I will definitely
be on your side.

65
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,111
Then I'll think it over.

66
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,560
(Keep Flattery)

67
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,551
Xiaojue, you know what?

68
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,230
You're the key man

69
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,591
of us all.

70
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,871
All of us are dying to hear

71
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,511
about your experiences in the UK.

72
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,910
(Keep Flattery)
Just come and share it.

73
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:23,110
Do it for our friendship.

74
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:36,271
Mengmeng, I...

75
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,550
This is for our friendship.

76
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,151
In that case,

77
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,191
I'll reschedule

78
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,470
and try my best to attend.

79
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:49,110
Since graduation,

80
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,310
it's rare for us to gather.

81
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:54,031
Okay, it's settled then.

82
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:55,310
Friday at 6 PM,

83
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,910
Pearl Hall, Crown Hotel.

84
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,831
See you there.

85
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,990
Crown Hotel. Okay.

86
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,236
Yeah!

87
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,511
Maybe I'm not that unlucky.

88
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,790
Key man.

89
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,031
Coming.

90
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,310
Coming.

91
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,831
Who are you?

92
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,670
You tell me.

93
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,031
You are so beautiful every day?

94
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:27,670
Of course, I am.

95
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:28,990
Why are you so happy?

96
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,350
My high school classmate just called,

97
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,910
saying they're holding a reunion
to welcome me back.

98
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,910
A high school classmate?

99
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,350
Yes.

100
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:39,910
It's been seven years for you guys.

101
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,391
The relationship between you
is quite good.

102
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:43,550
Holding a reunion for you?

103
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,151
Hard to refuse.

104
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,271
They invited me before,
yet I always said no.

105
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,670
I'll just attend for once.

106
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,350
Will Miss Lin be going too?

107
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:03,430
Why do you always ask about her lately?

108
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,310
So care about her?

109
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,990
Think there's something between us?

110
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,670
If there's nothing between you two,

111
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,151
then take me with you.

112
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,430
They're all people of low level.

113
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:23,271
If you go,

114
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,990
they would come and flatter you.

115
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,071
Quite annoying.

116
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:27,230
You'd feel uneasy.

117
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:28,910
Really?

118
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,151
Though our family isn't close
with the Zhu family,

119
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,910
if I remember correctly,

120
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:35,350
the daughter of Mr. Zhu,

121
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,031
Zhu Mengmeng was in your class, right?

122
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,430
Yes. We were classmates.

123
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,591
Her family is just as well-off as mine.

124
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,751
You've all been her classmates
for three years.

125
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,870
I bet your classmates

126
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,391
are quite worldly.

127
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,870
Anyway...

128
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:01,670
Forget it.

129
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,591
You're always like this.

130
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,271
You don't take me to your house

131
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,670
or meet your parents.

132
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,751
Now you won't let me
meet your classmates.

133
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,751
It's not surprising.

134
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,751
Maybe I'm not decent enough
to be with you.

135
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,951
Die'en, I didn't mean that.

136
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,470
Die'en, trust me.

137
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,110
I have my reasons.

138
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,470
Just wait until I sort out
my family matters,

139
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:35,071
I'll take you to my parents.

140
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,831
What family matters?

141
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:45,990
Well...

142
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,470
Tell me, what happened?

143
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,831
Tell me, what happened to your family?

144
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,430
Tell me!

145
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,230
It's not appropriate to tell you.

146
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,151
Considering our relationship,

147
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:08,430
there's nothing you should hide.

148
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,031
Just tell me.

149
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,711
My father

150
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,191
is seriously ill

151
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,430
and still hospitalized back home.

152
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,230
No money for his treatment.

153
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,910
He spent all the money

154
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,710
for my studies abroad.

155
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,751
We have to plead with the hospital,

156
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:38,871
"Don't kick us out!"

157
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:39,950
"Don't kick us out!"

158
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,430
My father is over seventy,

159
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,111
so I'm under pressure every day,

160
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:46,871
you know?

161
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:49,950
Don't be upset.

162
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,151
We'll find a way.

163
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:53,151
How can I not?

164
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,550
This card has 200,000 yuan I saved up.

165
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,070
The keyword is 000000.

166
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,231
Take it.

167
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,430
No, I can't accept it.

168
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,871
You've done so much for me.

169
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,950
I can't take your money.

170
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:17,790
Take it.

171
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,511
No.

172
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,430
I'll save my father

173
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,271
with my own efforts.

174
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:21,031
Just take it.

175
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,271
If it's not enough, tell me. Take it.

176
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,111
I can't take it.

177
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,590
Just take it.

178
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,190
Be good, just take it.

179
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,590
Okay.

180
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:35,590
I'll take it.

181
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,430
Don't be upset.

182
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,310
Die'en.

183
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,271
What can I do to repay you?

184
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:50,710
It's okay.

185
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,271
Things will be fine.

186
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:54,031
Die'en.

187
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,031
Thank you so much.

188
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:05,310
Die'en.

189
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,031
(Mengmeng.)

190
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,670
(Want to go to the art exhibition)

191
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,631
(together?)

192
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,031
I won't hang out
with someone so foolish.

193
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:19,912
(Want to go to the art exhibition together?
Sender: Silly Goose)

194
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:23,590
Mengmeng.

195
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,231
I bought tickets

196
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,070
for that exhibition.

197
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,471
- We...
- I'm not going.

198
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,910
Mengmeng.

199
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,070
I was being too rash about Xiaojue.

200
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,391
I shouldn't have judged without knowing

201
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,231
the whole story.

202
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,070
And I should have trusted you.

203
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:47,631
Whenever you face a problem,

204
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,710
you only talk about facts and evidence.

205
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,751
At best, you're fair and impartial,

206
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,511
but really,
you're just cold and indifferent.

207
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,590
Let me ask you. If one day,

208
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,991
you saw me getting close

209
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,070
to another guy,

210
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,631
would you judge me like that too?

211
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,351
No.

212
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:05,310
That's it.

213
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,511
No matter what,

214
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,790
you should trust Huan'er.

215
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,830
Trust us.

216
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:11,351
Sorry, Mengmeng.

217
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,070
We're going to have a class reunion.

218
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,830
Are you going?

219
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,910
Why?

220
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,310
Huan'er and Xiaojue...

221
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,151
Here you go again.

222
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:20,910
Didn't you just say

223
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,991
you'd trust us?

224
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,031
Are you going?

225
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,471
I-I'll go.

226
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,151
Mengmeng,

227
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,991
does that mean you forgive me?

228
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,631
Not exactly.

229
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,391
What do you want me to do?

230
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:43,670
Take me to the shooting range.

231
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,710
The shooting range?

232
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,231
The one near my place.

233
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,631
How did you know...

234
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,031
Secret.

235
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:00,031
This way.

236
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,590
I have a membership here.

237
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,631
You'll teach me twice a week.

238
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:15,910
You can't reject me.

239
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,231
How did you know I work here?

240
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,991
There's a bigger

241
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,310
and better range near your place.

242
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,351
Why come here?

243
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,231
Well,

244
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,111
I'll go demonstrate.

245
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,031
See?

246
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,231
Remember.

247
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,751
Spread your feet shoulder-width apart.

248
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:31,751
If you can't hold

249
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,590
the gun one-handed,

250
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,471
use both hands.

251
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,111
Go ahead, your turn. Try it.

252
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,310
But I'm too scared.

253
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,310
What's there to be scared of?

254
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,111
Just treat it like a toy gun.

255
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
Try one shot first.

256
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:14,511
Remember.

257
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,231
Relax your body

258
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,070
and focus.

259
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:19,111
Pretend nothing else exists.

260
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,790
Go ahead.

261
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,670
Try another shot.

262
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,351
Huan'er, what are you doing?

263
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,031
Compiling materials
on punishing the scumbag.

264
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,111
You met Hu Tiehan?

265
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,271
How did you know?

266
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:41,950
Look,

267
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,271
your face right now

268
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,511
is radiant with happiness.

269
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,351
Thanks to your comic last time.

270
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,511
I bet Cheng Die'en

271
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:51,710
has understood it.

272
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,031
Huan'er, I'm sorry.

273
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,111
What for?

274
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,830
What did you do to me?

275
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,790
I always saw you and Xiaojue

276
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,471
as my perfect love story.

277
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,910
I never knew you suffered so much

278
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,550
in this relationship.

279
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,310
As a friend,

280
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,710
I am so incompetent.

281
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,151
Of course, it's not your fault.

282
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,910
I'd say

283
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,430
I deserve it.

284
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,710
But it's okay.

285
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,471
I was simple before,

286
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,550
but from now on,

287
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:32,670
I decide to treat myself better.

288
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,830
Huan'er,

289
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,910
does all love

290
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,710
end up like this?

291
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,670
I read in a magazine

292
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:46,910
that marriage is love's graveyard.

293
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,430
All love

294
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,871
will end up being destroyed

295
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,310
by such trivial things.

296
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:54,670
Mengmeng,

297
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,310
let's keep things apart.

298
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,910
In my case,

299
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,590
I was blind before.

300
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,231
And now I can see clearly.

301
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,430
Recognizing a scumbag

302
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,911
and dumping him

303
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,031
is worth celebrating.

304
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,350
But that's totally different

305
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:11,711
from finding true love.

306
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,630
Besides, I believe

307
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,671
not everyone is like Ou Xiaojue.

308
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:16,191
Right?

309
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,790
Tiehan would never do that.

310
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,830
Absolutely.

311
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,671
The hotel's booked.

312
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,550
Really? Well done.

313
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:43,496
(Pay me back.)

314
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,671
It's time to end this.

315
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,870
Thanks for everything
you've done for me,

316
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,310
Huan'er.

317
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,751
Mr. Lin.

318
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,350
Xiaojue.

319
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,191
Looks great.

320
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:20,191
Right?

321
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,350
Where did you buy this outfit?

322
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:23,511
My company bought it.

323
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:24,751
Really?

324
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,271
I'll go over.

325
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:26,911
Okay.

326
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:28,550
Mengmeng.

327
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,110
Long time no see!

328
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,471
You're looking better and better!

329
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,431
You too.

330
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,150
Long time no see.

331
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,856
Long time no see.

332
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,191
Then I'll go sign in.

333
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,511
Right, you go sign in.

334
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,431
Long time no see.

335
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:43,590
Here you are.

336
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,271
Go sign in.

337
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,310
What's wrong?

338
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,711
What's wrong with me?

339
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,070
Nothing.

340
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:05,630
Good.

341
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,031
Nothing.

342
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,390
Good.

343
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,550
So is it good or not?

344
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,110
Hello, everyone.

345
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:27,431
Am I late?

346
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,231
Xiaojue, why are you so late?

347
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:29,951
Been waiting.

348
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,431
Hard to find a parking spot.

349
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,110
You know.

350
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,310
Xiaojue.

351
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,630
Juan'er.

352
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,191
Miss Li.

353
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,590
After so many years, you're still so

354
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,431
beautiful and fashion.

355
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,191
Studying abroad makes you different.

356
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,711
I've already forgotten

357
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:47,630
those English words

358
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:49,271
you said.

359
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:51,471
Talent Ou.

360
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,711
Mr. Ou.

361
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:54,711
Mr. Ou.

362
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,870
You were speaking a London accent
just now, weren't you?

363
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,790
You know,

364
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,790
I've been abroad for far too long.

365
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,511
It's already become a habit.

366
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,711
But it's not hard.

367
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,790
Practice more,

368
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,431
and everybody can speak that way.

369
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,150
- Speak.
- Speak.

370
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:15,110
- I know.
- I know.

371
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,191
Okay.

372
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:17,191
Hello.

373
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,310
Why are you all standing? Take a seat.

374
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:22,350
- Let's go.
- Take a seat.

375
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,110
Let's go.

376
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,991
Sorry.

377
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,110
Mengmeng.

378
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:31,191
I came today only for the sake of you.

379
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,711
Don't say that.

380
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,191
You came to meet all of us.

381
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,550
Please help me out

382
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,431
to expand my connections.

383
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,870
I thought you have connections
from the Cheng family.

384
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,070
Mengmeng.

385
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:51,310
Some things aren't what you think.

386
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,231
Have a seat.

387
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:01,471
Mengmeng.

388
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,110
You look stunning today.

389
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,870
You too.

390
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,511
Thanks to you,

391
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:07,110
so we can gather again.

392
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,191
That's great.

393
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,191
I miss you too.

394
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,191
Mengmeng.

395
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:13,630
Those earrings
really brighten your complexion.

396
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,310
Mengmeng, your outfit...

397
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,830
What's wrong?

398
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,431
Nothing.

399
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:22,711
Good, really special.

400
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,471
This outfit is good enough
for a TV show.

401
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,390
It's too extravagant just for dinner.

402
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:29,951
I'll recommend to you.

403
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,031
Okay.

404
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,630
She's so dressed up today.

405
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,150
It's just a class reunion.

406
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:37,390
But she's dressed

407
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:39,031
like she's attending some gala.

408
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:39,870
So what?

409
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,550
She's a wealthy heiress.

410
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,590
Showing off won't hurt.

411
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,711
Luckily, she's a wealthy heiress.

412
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:47,790
Otherwise, she won't even make a living
with her lousy comics.

413
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:49,471
Let's go.

414
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,590
Hu Tiehan, what's wrong?

415
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,431
What do you mean?

416
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:02,711
Nothing.

417
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:04,711
I'm just a bit confused

418
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:07,150
which one is trash.

419
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:12,671
How dare you insult us?

420
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,951
He insulted us.

421
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,911
Let's go.

422
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:23,671
What have you been doing?

423
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,711
Just keeping busy.

424
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,911
Let's get ready to eat.

425
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:31,350
Come on.

426
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,191
Just sit down.

427
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,110
So, is everyone here?

428
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,191
- No.
- No.

429
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:38,310
- Lin Huan'er.
- Huan'er.

430
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,991
She dumped Ou Xiaojue.

431
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:43,310
She might not come

432
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,471
to the class reunion.

433
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:45,951
I think it's not

434
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:47,711
because of Xiaojue.

435
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,590
She's dating a rich man now.

436
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,671
Looking down upon us now.

437
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,431
When did that happen?

438
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:03,150
Hello, everyone.

439
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,390
Long time no see.

440
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,390
A luxury bag.

441
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,711
Look.

442
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,310
She's so elegant now.

443
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,350
Did you see that bag?

444
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,310
- So overwhelming.
- So wealthy.

445
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,590
Dating a rich man really changes you.

446
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:31,711
You talk too much.

447
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,431
Is everything ready?

448
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:35,751
Everyone,

449
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,031
I propose we all toast to Xiaojue.

450
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,870
He's the pride of our class.

451
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:43,070
He worked hard to complete

452
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,231
his studies abroad

453
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:45,711
relying on his own abilities.

454
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,431
Xiaojue, well done!

455
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:48,711
- Good.
- Come on.

456
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:49,830
Let's toast to Xiaojue.

457
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,951
Come on, everyone, toast to Xiaojue.

458
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,031
- Together.
- Come on.

459
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,271
- Come on.
- Come on.

460
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,310
Sit.

461
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,928
Sit.

462
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,191
Let me say something.

463
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,271
We've all been old classmates for years.

464
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:17,790
I'll skip the flattery.

465
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,350
Studying abroad for seven years

466
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,630
wasn't easy at all.

467
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:23,231
I lost count of how many dishes

468
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,511
I scrubbed and bowls I washed

469
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:26,431
to get here today.

470
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,630
It forged me

471
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,671
into someone who never quits.

472
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,711
But you still got dumped.

473
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,511
Xiaojue has a promising future.

474
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,511
He's totally different

475
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:38,590
from those dating rich men.

476
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:40,951
Dating a rich man is risky.

477
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:43,070
Once the rich man disgusts her,

478
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,310
she might get dumped.

479
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,590
She would lose everything.

480
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:48,830
Exactly.

481
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,431
- Everyone.
- Let's wait and see.

482
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,590
I know

483
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:57,350
you all care about
my relationship with Huan'er.

484
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,031
Now,

485
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:03,431
Huan'er has made her choice

486
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,790
and found her love.

487
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,070
I'm really happy.

488
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:09,711
Huan'er.

489
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:13,870
We'd been together

490
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,231
for seven years.

491
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,431
We shared many wonderful memories.

492
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,431
I'm very grateful.

493
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,150
Let's end this now.

494
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,671
Whether we

495
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,991
end up together or not,

496
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:31,191
I wish you happiness.

497
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,110
- How magnanimous!
- How touching!

498
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,951
How can we end this now?

499
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:39,070
Ou Xiaojue.

500
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,070
That water I splashed on you

501
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,590
wasn't enough?

502
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,431
- Splashed water?
- What does it mean?

503
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,031
Mengmeng.

504
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,616
Turn on the projector.

505
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:57,951
(Expulsion Notice of Ou Xiaojue)

506
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,310
Everyone, please look at the big screen.

507
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,630
What's this?

508
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,296
Look.

509
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,150
This is the Expulsion Notice

510
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,711
showing Ou Xiaojue was expelled

511
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:10,790
for failing grades.

512
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,110
Expulsion?

513
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,390
- Why?
- Xiaojue.

514
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,110
His English just now was spot on.

515
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,711
- Yes, what happened?
- He's so decent.

516
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,550
How did you suddenly become

517
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,711
a returned elite?

518
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,070
You want to slander me?

519
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,711
Faking a piece of paper like this
is easy.

520
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,711
Fake?

521
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,110
What about this?

522
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,630
This is my bank transfer history,

523
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:47,176
showing I sent you
the money I earned from working hard.

524
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,191
Hurry! Let me see.

525
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,630
Stop eating.

526
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,271
- Let me see!
- So much money!

527
00:27:58,271 --> 00:27:58,951
Let me see.

528
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,191
Oh my, Xiaojue.

529
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,830
Exactly.

530
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,671
You said you earned

531
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:03,550
the money by working.

532
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,550
Didn't you study abroad?

533
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,830
Xiaojue, give us an explanation.

534
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,671
Exactly.

535
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,550
I admit it.

536
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:16,991
When I was at my lowest,

537
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:18,070
I borrowed money from you.

538
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:19,431
But we agreed

539
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,471
it was a loan, and

540
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,711
I've already paid you back.

541
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,310
You paid me back?

542
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,790
(Mr. Lin,)

543
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,431
(I've borrowed a lot
from Huan'er over the years.)

544
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,110
(She helped me a lot.)

545
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,951
(I'm very grateful.)

546
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:37,070
(This card)

547
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,110
(is me
returning the principal and interest.)

548
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:40,991
(Please, you must accept it.)

549
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,951
(It totals 200,000 yuan.)

550
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,431
He's repaid the money.

551
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:49,031
He's repaid the money.

552
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:49,608
Right.

553
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:50,150
Xiaojue.

554
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,911
I knew Xiaojue isn't that kind of guy.

555
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:54,390
How could he possibly live off a woman?

556
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,191
Xiaojue has paid you back.

557
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,590
It's settled.

558
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,511
Why are you pulling this stunt?

559
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,431
Isn't it just right
that he repaid the money?

560
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:02,991
But the money was repaid.

561
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,584
How can you accuse him falsely?

562
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:06,191
- This is pure slander.
- Lin Huan'er.

563
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:11,191
I wanted to save you some face.

564
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,830
After all, you were my first love.

565
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,590
You were someone I once loved.

566
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,231
I'm still too kind and soft-hearted.

567
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,711
I never imagined

568
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,231
you would become like this.

569
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:27,110
Do you want our seven years together

570
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,231
to become a stain on each other's lives?

571
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:30,984
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

572
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:32,310
It's been seven years.

573
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,184
Don't bring disgrace on us.

574
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:35,688
All for a little bit of money?

575
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,070
What about the three years

576
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,751
you were with me?

577
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:55,711
Who is this?

578
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:56,951
- Who's she?
- Haven't seen her.

579
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,070
Die'en, why are you here?

580
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:01,790
Perfect timing.

581
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:03,150
I wanted to break up with her,

582
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,390
yet she refused to let me go.

583
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:04,951
You know?

584
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,191
He used Lin Huan'er's money

585
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,310
to study abroad with me

586
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:20,511
and deceived me,
making me the other woman.

587
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:31,830
No wonder you didn't want me
to come to the reunion

588
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,830
and refused
to make our relationship public.

589
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,870
So you've been lying.

590
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,630
(If you're looking for me,
it must be somewhat serious.)

591
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:54,070
What does this mean?

592
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:56,031
This is an empty bank card.

593
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:58,191
Ou Xiaojue will mention it to you soon

594
00:30:58,711 --> 00:30:59,711
and you'll need it.

595
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,711
I gave you this
for your father's treatment.

596
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:14,590
Why is it
in Lin Huan'er's father's hands?

597
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,830
You tricked me into giving you money
to repay her,

598
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,431
just to erase her seven years

599
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,870
of sacrifice for you, right?

600
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:26,830
You are really scheming.

601
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,671
That's not true, Die'en.

602
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,431
Let me explain.

603
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:32,471
It's not true.

604
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,150
It's all her fault!

605
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:35,870
It's all her!

606
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,070
Lin Huan'er's set all this up.

607
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,310
That's not true.

608
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:42,431
Don't believe her.

609
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:43,310
This isn't the truth.

610
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,191
Die'en!

611
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:46,711
Let me go!

612
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:47,590
Trust me, Die'en!

613
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,431
- Let me go!
- Trust me!

614
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:48,991
Get lost!

615
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,231
Don't leave me, Die'en!

616
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,911
Die'en!

617
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:53,830
He's really a liar.

618
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,271
So that's the truth.

619
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,911
How could he do so?

620
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:00,191
What a "top student".

621
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:02,150
I trusted him before.

622
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,431
So he's just a gold digger.

623
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,310
What an embarrassment.

624
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,870
He's been deceiving us all along.

625
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:08,471
Appearances can be deceiving.

626
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:18,790
Don't worry.

627
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,711
It's not worth crying over a scumbag.

628
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,310
Good that you cut loss in time.

629
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:31,310
Thank you, Huan'er.

630
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,471
It's okay.

631
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,911
Thank you too.

632
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,830
I'm leaving.

633
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,191
Rest well.

634
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,550
Round two is on me.

635
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:00,511
Let's go.

636
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:04,550
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

637
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,310
Congratulate to Huan'er escaping misery

638
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,711
and toward a bright future!

639
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:08,711
Thanks, Mengmeng.

640
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:10,031
May you get better!

641
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,031
Thanks, Tiehan.

642
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,711
May you find Mr. Right soon!

643
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:18,711
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

644
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,110
Cheers!

645
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:25,224
(Secret Recipe Wontons)

646
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,350
Let's play some games.

647
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,070
We already explained the rules.

648
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,911
Each card represents each.

649
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:38,991
Whoever gets picked

650
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:40,830
has to share a wish.

651
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,671
Me first.

652
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,376
Okay.

653
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,630
Let's see what it is.

654
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,231
King of Hearts.

655
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:47,231
Huan'er, it's you.

656
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:49,790
Huan'er, what's your wish?

657
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:52,671
Then my wish is

658
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,310
for smooth sailing

659
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,471
and

660
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,191
a swift finish.

661
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,711
Finish what?

662
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:08,351
To finish destiny's arrangement,
of course.
