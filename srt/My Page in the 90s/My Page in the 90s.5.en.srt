12
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:58,773
Chairman Gao?

13
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,493
Let's chat?

14
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,893
I heard Gao Haiming is collaborating
with Yunsheng,

15
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,613
and requested you
to handle the business.

16
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:14,693
That's correct.

17
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:16,934
You're the second person to approach me.

18
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,054
No surprise.

19
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,494
Miss Xie came to see me before you.

20
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:23,173
Alright.

21
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:24,974
Hand it over.

22
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,413
What?

23
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:27,334
The check.

24
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,453
Didn't you come here to give me a check

25
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:32,774
to make me leave your son?

26
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:36,733
How much do you want?

27
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,534
You business moguls

28
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:45,453
have such a limited approach
to problem-solving.

29
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:49,254
Is marrying off your own son
the only way you can solve this problem?

30
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:53,254
What does my son's marriage
have to do with you?

31
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:54,814
Just tell me directly.

32
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:56,054
How much money do you want?

33
00:02:58,814 --> 00:02:59,853
500,000?

34
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,133
Five months.

35
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:04,453
I need five months.

36
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,133
Because the PR firm I work for

37
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,974
is currently partnering with Letao.

38
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:10,853
As the liaison,

39
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:14,214
I'll inevitably have work interactions
with your son during these months.

40
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:15,853
I'll be doing my job.

41
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:17,254
No need for concern.

42
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:21,013
Someone with his brilliant,
towering, perfect image

43
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:22,814
is beyond my reach.

44
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:25,853
But I need this job.

45
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,214
Please understand.

46
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,733
I need to make a living in this city.

47
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,214
After that whole speech,

48
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:36,654
you must want more than that, Miss Lin.

49
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,853
Since I invited you into my car,

50
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,293
it means this is a private conversation.

51
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:44,453
Just speak plainly.

52
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,334
Stop beating around the bush, okay?

53
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:51,054
No wonder your son
avoids talking with you.

54
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:52,934
You're way too paternalistic.

55
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:54,613
Paternalistic?

56
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,054
What paternalistic or maternalistic?

57
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:01,013
I am his father, okay?

58
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:02,453
True.

59
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:04,173
Forget I mentioned it.

60
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,374
(If I refuse the money,)

61
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:09,254
(he'll think I have bigger plans
for Gao Haiming,)

62
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,693
(making him more suspicious.)

63
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:11,693
(Not worth the risk.)

64
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:13,173
(I'd better)

65
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:15,893
(take some cash)

66
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,454
(and put the old man's mind at ease.)

67
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,613
How much do you want?

68
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,774
Does it really require
this much thought?

69
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:24,933
5,000.

70
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,574
5,000?

71
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:28,454
If you think that's too much,

72
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:29,534
we can negotiate.

73
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,413
Is that okay?

74
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,334
Well, this is unexpected.

75
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:41,173
My son is worth

76
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:43,654
just 5,000 to you?

77
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,014
You misunderstood.

78
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,813
He's not worth a penny to me.

79
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:50,894
Here's the thing.

80
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,053
Truth is,

81
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,974
even if you hadn't come today,

82
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,654
he probably wouldn't
give me a second look.

83
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,373
But since you're wealthy

84
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,613
and willing to share some generously,

85
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:02,654
I should know my place.

86
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,774
So whatever amount you offer...

87
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:06,574
This heavy?

88
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,253
Here's 50,000.

89
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,134
Enough to buy your "knowing your place"?

90
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:11,813
Is it enough?

91
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,053
Yes. More than enough!

92
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:14,253
No need to count it.

93
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:15,053
No need to check.

94
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,933
Every penny is there.

95
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,613
Now, get out.

96
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:18,253
Right away.

97
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:20,534
Thank you.

98
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:21,933
Just go.

99
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:23,933
Take care, Chairman Gao.

100
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:34,974
Leave the contract at Yunsheng.

101
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,053
So Lin Huan'er must
deliver it personally.

102
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:38,534
Then put on a show,

103
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,813
so everyone thinks you're dating.

104
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,413
When the chairman hears about it,

105
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,574
he'll at least realize you have
zero interest in Miss Xie.

106
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:49,534
Exactly as you planned.

107
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:51,974
Brilliant, sir.

108
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,613
You're sure Lin Huan'er got
into the chairman's car?

109
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,574
Absolutely. Saw it with my own eyes.

110
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,334
She was thrilled when she got off.

111
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,774
Clearly, she took quite a bit.

112
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:07,933
You said Lin Huan'er was special before.

113
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,053
I don't see how she's different
from those gold diggers.

114
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,373
But does she still hold
any value like this?

115
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:18,134
It's fine. We both get what we want.

116
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:23,694
Will you still go on the date
with Miss Xie?

117
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,613
Of course, I'm going. Why not?

118
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,654
Male Lead's fondness toward you
dropped again.

119
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,574
Currently at negative 50%.

120
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,334
(Dropped again?)

121
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,253
(Alright.)

122
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:43,454
(Let's see if you can
create more obstacles)

123
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:45,173
(or if I have more tricks.)

124
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:51,774
Hello.

125
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:53,933
Hello. May I ask...

126
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:58,933
Why are you here again?

127
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,094
I'm here to spend money, okay?

128
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:03,694
Okay.

129
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:06,214
Just don't cause a scene like last time.

130
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,413
I'd like someone to help
build the model.

131
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:20,293
It's fine. You take the order, Haiming.

132
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:21,373
I'm not picky.

133
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:22,534
Okay.

134
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:27,253
New Zealand King Salmon.

135
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,053
Iberian white ham.

136
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,094
Aged roast duck.

137
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:33,974
Two almond milk puddings.

138
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:35,813
And a bottle of La Tâche.

139
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:37,293
Thank you.

140
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,214
Okay. Just a moment.

141
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:46,214
I saw your father's marriage
announcement about the alliance.

142
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:49,574
He seems a bit too eager.

143
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:51,853
He is indeed a bit eager.

144
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:53,454
I hope you don't mind.

145
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,293
Of course not, Haiming.

146
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:58,253
Do you know?

147
00:07:58,493 --> 00:07:59,894
Back in school,

148
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:01,774
you were always first place.

149
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:03,493
And I was always second.

150
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:05,334
That always made me so happy.

151
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,413
Why?

152
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:11,774
Because it made me feel like
you and I were together.

153
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,733
No one was between us.

154
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:17,774
We were one unit.

155
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:22,813
Miss Xie, you really have
interesting thoughts.

156
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:25,613
But work has been so busy.

157
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,014
I've forgotten many things from before.

158
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:32,853
That's true. Your father also told me

159
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,974
that you are excellent in every way.

160
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,094
It's just that your mind
is entirely on work.

161
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:41,174
Well, you can't focus
on two things at once.

162
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,013
How can you remember everything?

163
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,493
But it's okay.

164
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:48,174
Once the arranged marriage is announced,

165
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,613
we'll be one unit.

166
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:54,174
I'll help you remember things
from now on.

167
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:00,493
You're right.

168
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:02,893
A father knows his son best.

169
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,013
I truly am focused entirely on work.

170
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,574
I have no other thoughts for now.

171
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:11,934
That's good.

172
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:30,334
Miss Xie,

173
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:32,414
Mr. Gao asked me to drive you home.

174
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:41,533
Luo,

175
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:45,373
what exactly is the relationship
between that Lin Huan'er and Mr. Gao?

176
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,294
They have no relationship.

177
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:57,094
Are you unwilling to tell me?

178
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,814
They really have no relationship.

179
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:01,613
Really no relationship?

180
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,054
If they have no relationship,

181
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,373
how could she just whisk Mr. Gao away
from the banquet?

182
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:06,733
If they have no relationship,

183
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,414
how could Mr. Gao negotiate a deal
with Yunsheng for her?

184
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:11,853
Trying to hide it from me?

185
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,133
I wouldn't dare.

186
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,773
You know how it is.

187
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,294
Even if Mr. Gao has
some connection with her,

188
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,694
that's his private business.

189
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:20,773
If he doesn't say,

190
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:22,094
how could I dare to ask?

191
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,294
Stop giving me excuses.

192
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,893
You've been with him for so many years.

193
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,694
There's no way you know nothing.

194
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:32,934
I really don't know anything.

195
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:33,773
Do you know?

196
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:40,133
Then if I'll tell you,

197
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,214
you can't tell anyone I told you.

198
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,414
I knew it.

199
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,414
Luo.

200
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,814
From now on, whenever you have news,

201
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:07,613
tell me first, okay?

202
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:09,814
Don't worry.

203
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,133
About today's matter,

204
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:13,214
no one will ever know
it was you who told me.

205
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,253
No need to drive me. Thank you.

206
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:36,773
Mr. Gao,

207
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:38,934
I told her everything as you asked.

208
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:42,373
Yes.

209
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,814
But it doesn't seem like
she intends to give up.

210
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:55,214
Okay, got it.

211
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,533
A flying kick. Flying kick.

212
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,613
It's okay. Put in another coin.

213
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:06,013
I'm done playing.

214
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,133
Then let me just finish this.

215
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:10,613
Almost done.

216
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,974
Huan'er, do you remember
that back in school,

217
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,814
Hu Tiehan was really good at this.

218
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,574
Every time we died,
he was the only one still alive.

219
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,414
Why are you always talking about...

220
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:22,853
Hu Tiehan?

221
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:24,214
(Wait.)

222
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:27,533
(Did Hu Tiehan die in the line of duty
at the end of the novel?)

223
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,253
(But isn't he a traffic cop now?)

224
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,133
(What's wrong with my brain?)

225
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,454
(I can't remember anything.)

226
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,373
Why did you stop moving
at this crucial moment?

227
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,294
Mengmeng, do you know...

228
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,094
(I can't trigger a rule punishment)

229
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,653
(for two fictional characters, right?)

230
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:45,733
Know what?

231
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:47,454
Nothing.

232
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,360
(Only five chances.)

233
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,013
What is it?

234
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,152
(I'd better use sparingly.)

235
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,733
(Otherwise, I'm done for.)

236
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,934
Let's go. Didn't you say
you want to quit?

237
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,454
Why do you always
leave your sentences hanging?

238
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,214
Let's go home.

239
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,294
What do you want me to know?

240
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,214
Know what to have for dinner.

241
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:49,974
It happens to be...

242
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:06,664
(Yunsheng Tower)

243
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,133
(This model has numerous
and complex parts.)

244
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,934
(He assembled it so well.)

245
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:14,613
(It shows he's very patient)

246
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,414
(and willing to invest time
in his interests.)

247
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,493
(I didn't expect that.)

248
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:34,373
Mr. Gao?

249
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,253
Why do you have this fighter jet model?

250
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,013
That's strange.

251
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,094
Has this fighter jet model
gone out of production?

252
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:45,214
No. But you didn't assemble this.

253
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,133
Why wouldn't it be me?

254
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:50,613
Do you think I couldn't handle
such a precise model?

255
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,893
Then how were
the ink wash stains removed?

256
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,934
Some prefer using an eraser pen.

257
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:00,334
But I prefer applying nitro varnish
several times first.

258
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,613
This way is more foolproof.

259
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:02,733
Any problem?

260
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,334
That's odd.

261
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,814
Why would you think
I didn't assemble this?

262
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,214
Could someone really

263
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:14,373
give away such
a painstakingly assembled model?

264
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:15,414
Would they?

265
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,174
Miss Lin,

266
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,814
I came today to explain something.

267
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:23,334
By the way,

268
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:26,574
which of these three colors
do you find more appealing?

269
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,533
How about we have a talk?

270
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,334
This red one looks best.

271
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:33,814
I'll use it.

272
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,054
Destroying others' hard work like this

273
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:38,174
isn't appropriate, Miss Lin.

274
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:40,773
Others' hard work?

275
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,814
You care deeply about others' hard work?

276
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,694
Then tell me, does my proposal
count as my hard work?

277
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,253
That's precisely what I came to explain.

278
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,214
It's fine.

279
00:15:58,013 --> 00:15:59,013
No need to explain to me.

280
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,334
I'm just thrilled to be recognized

281
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:02,613
by a boss like you.

282
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,694
Yes. This is exactly my proposal.

283
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:12,013
Look closely.

284
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:14,893
It's mine.

285
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:16,334
The time?

286
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,094
11:07.

287
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:19,733
If I recall correctly,

288
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,414
you arrived at Letao
in the afternoon, right?

289
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,334
You're not implying...

290
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:27,414
It may be hard to believe,

291
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,013
but I completed it before you arrived.

292
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,253
Both the concept and the approach

293
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,334
were identical to yours.

294
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,493
I apologize for not explaining earlier.

295
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,054
But since we'll be collaborating,

296
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,104
the misunderstanding shouldn't go on.

297
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,694
So I want to explain to you.

298
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:45,694
So that's how it is?

299
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,414
So, Miss Lin,

300
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:50,454
can we find a place to talk properly?

301
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,773
Are you asking me out for business

302
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:58,454
or a personal date?

303
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,853
A personal date.

304
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:05,894
Alright.

305
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,134
(The first step to getting closer.)

306
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:20,694
(Find common interests.)

307
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,333
(Reduce psychological distance.)

308
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,174
What can I get for you, sir?

309
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:28,093
Miss?

310
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,013
(I remember in the book,)

311
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,813
(Gao Haiming likes a food
with a very peculiar name.)

312
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:37,053
(I think it's called Angel Hair.)

313
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,134
Miss Lin, what would you like to eat?

314
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,654
Angel Hair.

315
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,214
Will you have the same as Mr. Gao?

316
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:50,694
Yes.

317
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,013
The same, thank you.

318
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,414
Miss Lin, how did you know
I'd order Angel Hair?

319
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,214
I can read minds. Do you believe it?

320
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:04,974
You don't believe it?

321
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:07,053
Then why not let me try?

322
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:14,293
You attract many admirers,

323
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:16,333
and are loyal to those you care about.

324
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:18,093
But...

325
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:19,174
What?

326
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:25,573
But you face some obstacles
in your career.

327
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,253
Full of ambition
but with nowhere to apply it.

328
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,374
Am I right?

329
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,414
Miss Lin, you studied psychology?

330
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,934
Then perhaps I should analyze you too?

331
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:39,894
Alright.

332
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,694
When you were analyzing me,

333
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,733
your eyes unconsciously looked
to the upper left.

334
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:47,614
Your eyebrows lifted slightly.

335
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,053
That didn't seem like
on-the-spot analysis.

336
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,093
It looked more like
you were searching your memory.

337
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,093
Seems you came prepared.

338
00:18:58,974 --> 00:18:59,934
You own broad interests.

339
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:02,253
But you only
scratch the surface of each.

340
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,813
Mr. Gao, you studied psychology too?

341
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:07,614
Just the basics.

342
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:22,934
Angel Hair is actually very thin pasta.

343
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,053
I just like its name.

344
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,053
But in terms of taste, it can't beat
the classic versions.

345
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,134
Falling for a dish

346
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:33,894
just because of its name.

347
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,854
Seems Mr. Gao is a romantic like me.

348
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,934
I wonder if assembling models
for others is also romantic?

349
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:49,134
So you admit that model
was assembled by me?

350
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:52,134
I'm just curious how you recognized it.

351
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,733
A tailor never fails
to recognize their own handiwork.

352
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:57,454
Even the tiniest flaw

353
00:19:57,454 --> 00:19:58,733
is known only to them.

354
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,414
Why picked me
to assemble that fighter jet?

355
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,333
Shouldn't you tell me

356
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,854
why you assembled jets for others?

357
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,374
Since you can read minds,

358
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:15,134
just take a guess.

359
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,773
(Oh, no. What exactly did the book say?)

360
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:23,493
(How would I know?)

361
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,854
Your mind-reading failed?

362
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:27,454
It doesn't matter.

363
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,733
None of those matters.

364
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:31,694
What matters is

365
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,813
the moment I received that jet,

366
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:36,533
seeing such an exquisite model

367
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,813
made all the day's unhappiness vanish.

368
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:40,454
It healed me.

369
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,333
Though I didn't uncover

370
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,854
why you assembled jets for others,

371
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,214
I believe

372
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:46,974
at least others' happiness

373
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,694
makes your effort worthwhile.

374
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:52,854
What more did you ask for?

375
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:58,214
You always seem so happy.

376
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:00,974
As a business elite,

377
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:03,253
shouldn't you have more freedom?

378
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:10,894
How could anyone have real freedom?

379
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,454
But you have more freedom
than us, right?

380
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,053
A fighter jet can fly far,

381
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,134
but I can't.

382
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,694
The bigger the empire,
the more constraints.

383
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:27,013
You know nothing.

384
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:53,573
Haven't you stared enough
during the meal?

385
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,253
I'm thinking.

386
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:59,208
The model jet you gave me

387
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:01,614
is absolutely perfect and beautiful.

388
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:04,333
I just don't know who to give it to.

389
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,333
That requires careful thought.

390
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:12,533
Sorry for taking up
your model-building time tonight.

391
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:15,934
One day's delay is nothing. It's fine.

392
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:22,454
But you seem very passionate
about PR work.

393
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:24,533
Trying so hard to understand me

394
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,733
just for a job?

395
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,214
Now that the contract's secured,

396
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,414
shouldn't you relax a bit?

397
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:33,654
Relax?

398
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,934
Mr. Gao, do you actually mean "give up"?

399
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:39,174
We've only shared one meal,

400
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:40,293
and you want me to give up?

401
00:22:41,214 --> 00:22:43,894
So you don't plan to give up.

402
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:46,533
Do you think I should give up?

403
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:50,694
I'll tell you next time we meet.

404
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:54,174
Okay.

405
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:45,573
How could I be so careless?

406
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:47,333
Careless?

407
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:51,533
Since you lives with Miss Zhu,

408
00:23:52,654 --> 00:23:55,293
you could get in even
without a key, right?

409
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:56,454
Yes.

410
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,174
Since you knew that,

411
00:23:58,174 --> 00:23:59,253
why return it to me?

412
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,813
You started the verse.

413
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,813
I couldn't let the stage
go cold, could I?

414
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:05,214
Harsh.

415
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:06,293
You too.

416
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,333
Sir, another bowl of wontons, please.

417
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,168
- Thanks.
- Your wontons.

418
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:29,414
What? Can't handle hot wontons
with a Western palate?

419
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,854
You seem to have quite the appetite.

420
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,093
You treated me to Angel Hair.

421
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,493
I treat you to wontons.

422
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:38,333
It's like for like.

423
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:05,013
Careful, it's hot.

424
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:10,813
Is it good?

425
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:32,053
(Wouldn't the fondness shoot
straight up to 50%?)

426
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:35,813
It's just a set of keys.

427
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:37,894
You could return them any time.

428
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:41,253
Yet you chose to come back
specifically at night.

429
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,533
Didn't you just ask me a question?

430
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:46,974
Didn't you say you'd tell me next time?

431
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:48,614
Isn't this "next time"?

432
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:55,733
My answer is...

433
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:57,214
Don't.

434
00:25:58,694 --> 00:25:59,454
Don't what?

435
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:10,214
Don't give up.

436
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,813
(Why isn't the fondness changing?)

437
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:08,614
Mr. Gao.

438
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:09,894
What's wrong?

439
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,813
You've never had this expression
coming home before.

440
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:14,053
What expression?

441
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:17,493
Like you know you're going to win...

442
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:19,894
Victory is assured...

443
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:21,614
No, dead set on winning...

444
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:22,733
What do you want to say?

445
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:24,934
Don't get mad if I say this.

446
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:25,493
Spit it out.

447
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:27,454
Trying way too hard.

448
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,773
Luo, why are you still in the company?

449
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:33,053
Mr. Gao, I'm leaving right now.

450
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:34,414
Good night.

451
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:58,854
Decided to show your face, huh?

452
00:28:01,573 --> 00:28:02,333
Mr. Chairman.

453
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,253
About the innovation
and R&D idea of yours,

454
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,854
Uncle Li already told me.

455
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:12,854
I waited up to hear your explanation.

456
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,573
What exactly are you thinking?

457
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,533
Mr. Chairman, you know it better.

458
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:22,134
Letao's current strategy
is far too conservative.

459
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:24,214
Bringing in foreign capital

460
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:25,333
is selling out for peace.

461
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,813
We'll never get the terms we want.

462
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:30,414
I simply can't understand.

463
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,934
There's a clear shortcut
right in front of us,

464
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:35,813
yet you insist on taking
the long, muddy detour.

465
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:36,934
Why?

466
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,533
I don't consider marrying
into Fuchuang a shortcut.

467
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,053
Gao Haiming,

468
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:46,934
what right do you have
to look down on Fuchuang?

469
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:49,573
Fuchuang is the biggest
domestic distributor now.

470
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:50,614
It's a blessing

471
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:52,533
that Wanjun looks your way, you know?

472
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:55,293
Why else would Fuchuang choose
to partner with us?

473
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:56,374
Mr. Chairman,

474
00:28:56,974 --> 00:28:59,134
Letao's crisis is born of this era.

475
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:01,134
Our only way out is independent R&D.

476
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:03,174
Don't give me that "era" nonsense!

477
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,694
I'm telling you. There's only one way
for you to save yourself.

478
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:08,174
Dump that unsavory woman immediately,

479
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,333
and marry Wanjun.

480
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,934
We'll discuss everything else later.

481
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,008
Mom.

482
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,414
Stay with me for a while.

483
00:29:35,134 --> 00:29:35,816
Okay.

484
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,333
In my heart,

485
00:29:52,454 --> 00:29:53,733
I've always felt I failed you.

486
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:59,293
When you were little,
your father and I both fell short.

487
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:01,253
You've suffered enough.

488
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:03,333
Now you're grown,

489
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:06,773
and when it comes to marriage,

490
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:11,253
I don't want you to compromise

491
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:12,333
or make sacrifices.

492
00:30:13,654 --> 00:30:14,333
Marriage

493
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:19,934
is far too important

494
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,654
in a person's life.

495
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,733
Don't you end up like me.

496
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,253
Alright, Mom. I know.

497
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:37,614
Remember this.

498
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:41,614
Whatever you decide,

499
00:30:43,854 --> 00:30:45,214
whatever you want to do,

500
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:48,894
I'll support you.

501
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:52,533
Truly.

502
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,214
I just want you to be happy.

503
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:57,493
Just be happy.

504
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:00,573
That's what matters most.

505
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:12,854
Luo, follow up on this tomorrow.

506
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,773
Please book a window seat for me

507
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,493
for the Sky Garden
afternoon tea tomorrow.

508
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:34,374
Archery.

509
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:36,813
Can I try this?

510
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,374
Sure.

511
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:38,253
For the two of you?

512
00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:39,053
Yes, two of us.

513
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:40,013
Thank you.

514
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:43,374
- Let me see.
- Give it a try.

515
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:47,454
Like this.

516
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:49,854
Yes, wedge it in.

517
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,333
Wedge it in.

518
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:54,974
Arch your thumb.

519
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:55,614
Thumb.

520
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:00,733
I can't.

521
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:01,974
It's too heavy.

522
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:02,694
Maybe forget it.

523
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:03,573
No way.

524
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:05,733
Dare to make a bet?

525
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,093
Let's see who's the better shot.

526
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:11,854
Truth or Dare.

527
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,013
The loser answers one question
from the winner,

528
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,894
or does one thing the winner asks.

529
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:18,174
Alright.

530
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:21,013
You go first.

531
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,374
I'll go first.

532
00:32:49,694 --> 00:32:51,253
Just a hair away from the bullseye.

533
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:53,694
Your turn.

534
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,293
You got skills and didn't say so.

535
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:04,894
Hold it. Right.

536
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,854
Then arch with your thumb.

537
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:09,333
Arch your thumb.

538
00:33:22,888 --> 00:33:26,360
♪I woke up in a strange place♪

539
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,290
♪The sunlight here is blindingly bright♪

540
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:34,333
Arch it.

541
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:36,214
Loose.

542
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,293
Who gets credit for that?

543
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:44,654
You win.

544
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:51,271
♪I must escape this dream♪

545
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:57,192
♪Yet why does my heart
surrender before you♪

546
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,333
Right here.

547
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,214
We're eating right here?

548
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:05,214
Yeah.

549
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:08,334
You've never eaten
like this here before, right?

550
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:13,934
Hold on.

551
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:21,493
Sit.

552
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:30,573
Here you go.

553
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:31,533
Thanks.

554
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:40,613
How is it?

555
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,334
The coffee tastes quite unique.

556
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:46,693
Unique is exactly right.

557
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:48,533
I specially brewed this for you.

558
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:50,653
This coffee's name is

559
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:53,454
"Coffee on the Left Bank by the Seine,"

560
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:54,854
"a cup in my hand, savoring..."

561
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:58,693
The name's that long?

562
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:00,734
You know nothing.

563
00:35:08,294 --> 00:35:09,414
So have you decided?

564
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,493
Who should I give
my fighter jet model to?

565
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:15,934
I thought about it.

566
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,533
One shouldn't interfere in others' love.

567
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:25,693
So you should make the choice yourself.

568
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,454
But how can you count as others?

569
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,213
You're practically an involved party.

571
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,974
You know about this substance
called a catalyst?

572
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:39,934
It doesn't undergo
chemical reactions itself.

573
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:43,533
But it helps other substances react.

574
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,133
Helping others assemble a fighter jet
is a catalyst too.

575
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:48,934
But it doesn't interfere
in others' love.

576
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:55,414
First time I heard someone
describe matchmaking so romantically.

577
00:35:56,774 --> 00:36:00,334
So, Mr. Gao, you only want
to be the catalyst in my love life

578
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:02,254
and don't want to be part of it?
