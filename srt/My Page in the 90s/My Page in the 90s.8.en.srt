Dr. Liu Yan has rejected our contract.

14
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,150
Should we negotiate further?

It's unnecessary.

You can tell me.

Maybe I'll have an idea

43

(If I can help him
solve the expert issue)

his fondness for me increase,)

Squeeze it when you're stressed.

give it a tap.

58

00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:57,910
Gao.

189
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,550
There's something else.

190
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:08,229
Hello?

191
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:09,270
Gao Haiming.

192
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,589
I've found a solution to your problem.

193
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,229
Wei Dazhuang.

194
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,790
Dr. Wei.

195
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,709
When he was at Chuantu Institute,

196
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,629
he was juggling
several projects at once.

197
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,910
Now he's suddenly taking leave
and transferring.

198
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,829
He must be facing some issue.

199
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,430
SAP.

200
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,310
Super Absorbent Polymer.

201
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:35,349
Actually, for this,

202
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:36,509
we have a better candidate.

203
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,430
No. It has to be him.

204
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,150
Listen.

205
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,989
He's not well-known yet,

206
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:42,910
but like you,

207
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,310
he has a visionary mind.

208
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,629
Others might not see it,

209
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:47,430
but I know it.

210
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,430
You have to trust me.

211
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:53,829
Dr. Wei.

212
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:56,109
If he's transferring now,

213
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:58,030
that's our perfect opportunity.

214
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,629
This can be our breakthrough.

215
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,030
- First thing.
- Let Luo check...

216
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,150
Navigate well.

217
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,989
And then?

218
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,229
Then, be quiet for a while.

219
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:11,910
Enjoy the view outside.

220
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:16,790
I just thought,

221
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,430
since I recommended him,

222
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,829
I should do my homework.

223
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:21,989
You've already done plenty.

224
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,229
Alright. I'll shut up.

225
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,070
Back there,

226
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,229
we should have turned left.

227
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:44,829
I'll make a U-turn.

228
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,910
WE STRONG.

229
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,190
Wei Strong?

230
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:23,109
This is it.

231
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:25,950
The view here is amazing.

232
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,430
If I were him,

233
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,430
I'd take a year off
to vacation here first.

234
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,229
Everything can wait.

235
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,509
It's a blessing

236
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:32,430
that I'm not your boss.

237
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:33,589
You will be.

238
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,509
(WE STRONG B&B)
Why? I'm giving you a chance

239
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,950
(WE STRONG B&B)
to be my boss.

240
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,430
Hello. We'd like to see Dr. Wei.

241
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:59,670
What Dr. Wei? Don't know him.

242
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,469
What? He's Wei Dazhuang.

243
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,749
We've come all the way from Bozhou.

244
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:05,670
It's about business.

245
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,629
We need to see Dr. Wei.

246
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:07,190
Is he here?

247
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,589
The one you're after is back.

248
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,349
Hello. Are you Dr. Wei?

249
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,190
Who are you?

250
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,288
(Gao Haiming)
Gao Haiming from Letao.

251
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,950
Regarding polymer materials,

252
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,829
I have some ideas.

253
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:44,829
I hope to work with you.

254
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:45,790
No, thanks.

255
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,709
Dr. Wei.

256
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,390
Dazhuang, the engine sound isn't right.

257
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,950
Take a look. It sounds off.

258
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,469
Hop on it.

259
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,310
Excuse me.

260
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,790
Can you give us a chance

261
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,070
to sit down and talk properly?

262
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,150
Are you okay?

263
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:29,709
Yeah, we're fine.

264
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,589
Sorry about that.

265
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:34,390
We didn't mean to.

266
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,950
Can we have five minutes?

267
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,950
Just five minutes.

268
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,869
How about I talk with you?

269
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,224
Okay.

270
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:44,616
(Gao Haiming)

271
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,550
Your previous work

272
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,950
was in polymer materials research,

273
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,589
right?

274
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,030
I visited Chuantu Institute.

275
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,310
But I heard
you might be transferring out.

276
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,030
You've done your homework.

277
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,070
Is there a problem?

278
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:01,270
Then I'll get straight to the point.

279
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,110
I'd like to invite you to join Letao

280
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,749
and work on materials R&D

281
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:07,190
for feminine and infant products.

282
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,269
But his research is mostly

283
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:10,549
industrial and agricultural.

284
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,110
That's completely unrelated, isn't it?

285
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,390
Well,

286
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,309
the SAP Dr. Wei studies

287
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,989
can be used in sanitary pad cores.

288
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:19,390
Although currently,

289
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,069
it's mainly agricultural and industrial,

290
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,350
I believe

291
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,069
SAP's usage

292
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,749
in the medical and health sector

293
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:25,509
is mainstream.

294
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,749
My work is research beneficial

295
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,590
for societal agricultural development.

296
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:35,269
In short,

297
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,910
even if I leave Chuantu,

298
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,830
I won't get involved

299
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:40,830
with sanitary...

300
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,590
Sanitary pads.

301
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,016
Yes.

302
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,430
Hold on. You're a grown man.

303
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,469
How can you bring up

304
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,549
such things so casually?

305
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,910
This is a perfectly
normal thing, isn't it?

306
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:51,989
No need to censor it.

307
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,150
Yes.

308
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:54,190
But we don't need

309
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,190
to discuss it in daily life, right?

310
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,950
Especially between two grown men.

311
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,670
Plus, there are two ladies present.

312
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,670
Forget it.

313
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,190
There's no point arguing with you.

314
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,509
Please reconsider.

315
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,709
Nothing to reconsider.

316
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:10,350
Let's call it a day.

317
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,309
Excuse me.

318
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,150
Dr. Wei.

319
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,309
Grab the toolkit.

320
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,549
We need to reinforce a spot.

321
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,069
Please think it over.

322
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,830
It's alright.

323
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,870
I think we still have

324
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,830
a pretty good chance.

325
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,110
It's just that they're still

326
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,029
a bit uncomfortable
discussing women's topics.

327
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,789
It's normal. People of this era

328
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,350
think it's kind of a taboo

329
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,830
to talk about such things in public.

330
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,029
This era?

331
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,549
Except for weirdos like you.

332
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,229
Anyway,

333
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,029
we found the person.

334
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,029
We have a chance.

335
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,830
We need to find a way in.

336
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:09,430
They're not leaving, are they?

337
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,190
Your cruiser is really nice.

338
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:17,749
You know motorcycles?

339
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:19,350
Go on.

340
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,789
Long wheelbase.

341
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,950
A 16-liter fuel tank
paired with a V-twin engine.

342
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,229
Smooth power delivery.

343
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,229
Stable ride.

344
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,309
But...

345
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,590
Yes,

346
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,630
it falls short on safety

347
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,190
on unpaved roads and curves.

348
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,670
So the seat and armrests
need adjustments,

349
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,430
including widening these footpegs.

350
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,430
Are you riding the 318 route?

351
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:46,190
I see.

352
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,190
Given your current state of mind
and situation,

353
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,989
the 318 route seems fitting

354
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,269
to look for a future direction.

355
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,350
I don't follow.

356
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,509
But once you set out,

357
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:04,350
you'll face

358
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,110
a series of diverse problems.

359
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:07,989
When confronting them,

360
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,309
if you haven't figured it out,

361
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,110
or if you choose to escape,

362
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,110
there's no way
you'll make it to the end.

363
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,430
We're the riders.

364
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,670
We're the ones experiencing it.

365
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,910
We can choose to start,

366
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,789
or we can choose to give up.

367
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:30,309
However,

368
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,430
this doesn't seem to concern you at all.

369
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,509
A top school grad

370
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,630
with exceptional professional skills

371
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:38,989
and unique insights

372
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,509
in the field of materials science.

373
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,350
I don't think you'd give up easily.

374
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,709
There's more than one mountain.

375
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,630
Setting out after figuring things out

376
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:53,029
isn't too late.

377
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,029
If you want to persuade my brother,

378
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,709
I don't think it's necessary.

379
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,190
Don't overthink it.

380
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,110
I was just

381
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,910
sharing thoughts.

382
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,830
I actually quite envy you guys.

383
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,870
Here.

384
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,590
- Thanks...
- Here.

385
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,630
Your oil and filter
need changing, right?

386
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,709
How many kilometers now?

387
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,709
Over five thousand.

388
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,870
Then it's time.

389
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,630
Got new ones?

390
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,789
Yes, right here.

391
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,229
I can do it for you.

392
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,309
If you're helping, I'm thrilled.

393
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,590
It takes a lot of time.

394
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,910
I haven't touched a motorcycle in ages.

395
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,830
My hands are itching.

396
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,190
Put gloves on, then.

397
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,789
Sure.

398
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:02,888
(Fortune)

399
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,229
You know your stuff, girl!

400
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,830
I'll come to you for my next service.

401
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:11,789
Your motorcycle is definitely fine,

402
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,150
but the gear you've prepared,

403
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:15,190
not so much.

404
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,630
No?

405
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,029
To be honest,

406
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:21,549
it's a bit amateurish.

407
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,749
Amateurish?

408
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,789
I see you've got

409
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,509
stuff like sun protection

410
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:27,749
and hiking emergency supplies.

411
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,150
Do you usually prefer

412
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,749
tropical motorcycle trips?

413
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:33,029
Yeah, that's right.

414
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,069
See?

415
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,069
Each route

416
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,029
has its own gear requirements.

417
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,549
Someone with experience like me

418
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:39,910
can tell at a glance

419
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,229
that your gear

420
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,590
isn't really suitable

421
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,989
for a high-altitude area like 318.

422
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,430
So what gear should we bring?

423
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,549
Well...

424
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:50,630
Oh, look, it's getting dark.

425
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,469
We might stay for the night.

426
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,789
Hey, just give us a few pointers.

427
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:57,029
It's okay.
We can discuss it slowly tomorrow.

428
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,150
Any rooms available?

429
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,029
It's almost the weekend. Let me check.

430
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,469
We only have one room left.

431
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:03,590
It might be expensive.

432
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,190
Will you...

433
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,709
Guo,

434
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,350
just let them stay.

435
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,150
It's on the house.

436
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:08,229
Mr. Wei,

437
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:09,509
let's keep things apart.

438
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:10,709
We have to pay.

439
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:11,789
But I think

440
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,749
we are friends now, right?

441
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,630
Sure.

442
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,469
Don't forget

443
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,830
to tell me what to bring tomorrow.

444
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:17,910
No problem.

445
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:18,950
Please register here.

446
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:26,150
Um, maybe I...

447
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:27,430
Maybe what?

448
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:29,229
Come here.

449
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:29,749
What?

450
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:31,590
What's wrong?

451
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,709
Didn't you hear her?

452
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:33,670
There's only one room.

453
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:34,989
I heard that.

454
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,029
- Then...
- What?

455
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:36,680
Register.

456
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,430
The two of us.

457
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,670
Yes.

458
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:40,269
No.

459
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:43,029
What?

460
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:45,590
No, we...

461
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,709
You... I...

462
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:49,709
I'm not going to eat you.

463
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,749
Come on, sign it properly!

464
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:52,989
Wait.

465
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,749
Then...

466
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:54,309
Room number?

467
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:54,910
319.

468
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,430
Thanks.

469
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:59,549
Hurry up.

470
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,110
Who are we here for?

471
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,069
Here's your key.

472
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:09,390
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

473
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:11,560
I...

474
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,989
Um...

475
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,830
We managed to keep them here.

476
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:19,630
The rest is up to you.

477
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,709
I can't believe a CEO

478
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,469
got splashed with mud.

479
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,309
319.

480
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,509
319, 319.

481
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:32,989
This is it, right?

482
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,390
Why isn't it locked?

483
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:39,749
This room is strange.

484
00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:41,029
It's set up like a warehouse.

485
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,509
How can anyone stay here?

486
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,430
We must have the wrong room.

487
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:52,630
Turn the light on.

488
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,549
No power.

489
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:56,910
Then open the door!

490
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,269
It's locked.

491
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,749
No way.

492
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,469
Really.

493
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,910
I didn't touch it.

494
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:08,709
Let me see, let me see.

495
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:10,469
Anyone there?

496
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,350
It's rusted shut.

497
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,350
Come on, let me try.

498
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,069
I'll find some tools

499
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:16,910
and see if I can pry it open.

500
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,870
Dear me! Dear me!

501
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,448
No! No!

502
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,150
- A rat!
- What?

503
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:26,910
There's a rat!

504
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,590
Get it away!

505
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:28,630
I'm going to die!

506
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,309
Get rid of it!

507
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:30,309
Don't let it crawl on me!

508
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:31,309
- Slippers!
- Huh? What?

509
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:32,269
It's just a slipper.

510
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:32,950
No way!

511
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,549
What was it?

512
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:34,630
Slipper! A slipper.

513
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,870
It's okay. A slipper.

514
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,709
Scared?

515
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,229
No.

516
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,350
How could I be?

517
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,509
Let's make a call.

518
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,709
Luo.

519
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:54,110
We're stuck

520
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,910
at WE STRONG B&B,

521
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,430
Room 319. Contact them.

522
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,950
Get the door open. ASAP.

523
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:03,709
Let's wait.

524
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,190
Speaking of which,

525
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:09,110
I've never seen you

526
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,950
like that just now.

527
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,630
What are you up to?

528
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,989
Are you making fun of me?

529
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,789
No.

530
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,509
I meant how you were
like a professional female rider.

531
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,190
Oh, you mean that.

532
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,469
Actually, watching them

533
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:27,630
fix the motorcycles today,

534
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,430
I was kind of envious.

535
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,910
It's quite a coincidence.

536
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:32,509
Five years ago,

537
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,229
I had a plan to ride the 318 route.

538
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,670
But because of work,

539
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,029
I never got to go.

540
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,229
I scrolled a lot of short videos.

541
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:43,509
Short videos?

542
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,590
Yes.

543
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,110
Just scrolling...

544
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,110
There isn't any.

545
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:51,190
It's a blogger review.

546
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:54,509
Internet uploader.

547
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:55,830
- What?
- Forget it, forget it.

548
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,630
They are not around.

549
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,269
How can I explain this?

550
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,749
It's a web browser.

551
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:03,269
I searched for cycling guides

552
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:05,830
and read some.

553
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,830
Anyway, in the end,

554
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,430
I never got the chance to go.

555
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,029
Since you like it so much,

556
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,549
why not just go right away?

557
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:16,029
Work isn't everything in life after all.

558
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:19,029
Did I just hear that

559
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:20,269
from a boss?

560
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,350
Are you encouraging me to skip work?

561
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,029
Mr. Gao.

562
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,870
If one day you're free,

563
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,150
what would you do?

564
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:30,830
Me?

565
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,749
Perhaps I'd like

566
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:38,910
to go cycling

567
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,110
with someone I love.

568
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,069
Someone you love.

569
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:14,469
Is anyone there?

570
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,910
- Yes.
- Hello?

571
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,549
In here.

572
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,950
Worst timing ever.

573
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,950
This is Room 319.

574
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:32,110
This is more like it.

575
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,430
I'm so sorry

576
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,630
about what happened.

577
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,630
That storage room was originally 316.

578
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,830
Probably a loose screw.

579
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,670
I'm so sorry that you were

580
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,709
trapped there.

581
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:44,789
It's okay.
I wish we could've stayed longer.

582
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,469
No, you came just in time.

583
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:50,430
Perfect timing.

584
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,709
I noticed you have no luggage.

585
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,950
And your clothes got dirty.

586
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,150
Here are two sets of clothes
from my brother and me.

587
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,870
They're clean.

588
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:58,549
For you.

589
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,190
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

590
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,350
Tonight,

591
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,590
can we talk a bit more

592
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,430
with Dr. Wei?

593
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,830
I'm afraid not.

594
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,029
But we have a bonfire tonight.

595
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,029
You could join us

596
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,190
for a barbecue treat.

597
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,309
That works too.

598
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:13,989
Okay, thanks.

599
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,789
Rest up first. I'll head out now.

600
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,590
Find me if needed. See you later.

601
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,590
See you tonight.

602
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,029
If Dr. Wei isn't there tonight...

603
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,950
We'll improvise then.

604
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:31,789
Get settled.

605
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:33,390
I'll grab something from the car.

606
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,069
Cheers!

607
00:29:59,229 --> 00:29:59,989
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

608
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,709
Eat while it's hot.

609
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,430
Dig in.

610
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,309
- Here.
- Come on.

611
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:07,989
Give me one.

612
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,269
Come on, bottoms up!

613
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:12,670
Smells amazing.

614
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,229
Boss eats first.

615
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,190
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

616
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,789
Come on, another.

617
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:21,229
- Cheers!
- Let's drink.

618
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:21,989
So happy.

619
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:22,549
Drink up.

620
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:23,469
Did you both finish?

621
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:23,989
Bottoms up.

622
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,950
Let's talk.

623
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,150
What do you want to know?

624
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:30,670
Actually,

625
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,789
we just want to know

626
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,350
why Dr. Wei transferred departments.

627
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,549
It's what you guessed.

628
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,469
Unfair treatment.

629
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,670
He studied hard for over a decade

630
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,789
to achieve something

631
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:42,950
In the scientific field.

632
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,350
But before he even started,

633
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:47,870
it was over.

634
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,150
He's already given up.

635
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,430
I don't think so.

636
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,630
Don't give up.

637
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,870
If he persists to the end,

638
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,110
the name Wei Dazhuang

639
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,469
will be shining brightly

640
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:02,150
in this field for twenty years.

641
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:02,870
Yes.

642
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,789
The new functional polymer material

643
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:05,830
has a promising future

644
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,190
and wide applications
in hygiene products.

645
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,789
I am curious though.

646
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,989
As a man,

647
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,549
why are you making feminine products?

648
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,789
When you're committed,
gender shouldn't matter.

649
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,069
But commercial goals

650
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:20,430
and personal ideals are different.

651
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:21,910
What do you mean by that?

652
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:25,350
Businessmen are profit-driven.

653
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,830
Once costs get too high

654
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,830
and profits vanish,

655
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,190
they cut corners,

656
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,670
with no regard for product quality.

657
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:34,630
They won't listen to my brother then.

658
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,029
I understand.

659
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,670
But not everyone is like that.

660
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,350
Perhaps.

661
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:52,870
I've said too much.

662
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,910
No, no, not at all.

663
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:57,069
Actually, the reason
I came to see Dr. Wei

664
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,069
is because Letao

665
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,190
could really use his help.

666
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,630
Profit is one thing,

667
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,989
but more importantly,

668
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,110
I want to change

669
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,549
public perception and attitudes.

670
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,469
If Letao's feminine product line

671
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:08,670
can proceed smoothly,

672
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,830
we can work on

673
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,350
more promotion and public education.

674
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,269
People won't need to use

675
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,789
terms like "that time of the month"

676
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:16,110
or "period" for menstruation.

677
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:17,549
We can help people

678
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:18,910
acknowledge and accept it.

679
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,029
Yes.

680
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,269
Menstruation is just

681
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:24,870
a perfectly normal word.

682
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:26,509
It simply means that this month,

683
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:28,269
my body is functioning normally.

684
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,269
It's healthy.

685
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,029
There's no need for euphemisms.

686
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,110
Exactly.

687
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,509
The women around us

688
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:35,989
deserve better care.

689
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:36,509
Right?

690
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,229
At first, I thought you were just

691
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:41,870
using the slogan of caring for women

692
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:42,950
to grab attention.

693
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,309
But it seems
you have some genuine intent.

694
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,150
We're just looking at this objectively

695
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,150
and rationally.

696
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,670
So, could I trouble you

697
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,069
to talk to Dr. Wei?

698
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,110
But Dr. Wei

699
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,350
wants to contribute to humanity

700
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,630
through agriculture.

701
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,749
I understand.

702
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:02,229
However, the domestic

703
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:03,029
SAP materials

704
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,150
largely rely on imports.

705
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:04,910
Think about it.

706
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,390
If we can develop it independently,

707
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,670
and break foreign tech barriers,

708
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,190
won't that be more meaningful

709
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,830
and challenging?

710
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,029
Besides, we live in such a great era,

711
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,469
where everything is thriving.

712
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:16,229
Why not go with the flow?

713
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,749
How exactly?

714
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:20,509
The millennium is approaching.

715
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,150
The future is full of hope.

716
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,029
I have a feeling

717
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,630
that globalization
is an unstoppable trend.

718
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,989
Opportunities and challenges
will come together.

719
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:30,989
To withstand the impact,

720
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,630
we must establish our own brands

721
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,229
and build a good reputation

722
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,069
for "Made in China".

723
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,430
I want to make Letao

724
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:40,350
a leading domestic brand,

725
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:42,590
creating greater social value.

726
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,989
That's why we need talents

727
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:45,870
like Dr. Wei on board.

728
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,150
Yes.

729
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,910
I did come this time

730
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,190
to recruit your brother.

731
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,950
But I think

732
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,630
Dr. Wei and I

733
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,870
are comrades-in-arms.

734
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,110
I want to witness

735
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,670
the future together with Dr. Wei.

736
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:03,549
But aren't you being overly confident?

737
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:05,309
Why are you so sure about his success?

738
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,830
Because I trust her.

739
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:13,189
She's never wrong.
