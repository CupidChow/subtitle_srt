12
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:45,815
Gao Haiming.

13
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:49,216
Die'en? Long time no see.

14
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,455
Long time no see.

15
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,136
Long time no see.

16
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:57,216
Let me introduce you, Xiaojue.

17
00:01:59,095 --> 00:01:59,936
Hurry up.

18
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:02,776
Let me introduce you.

19
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,535
Gao Haiming,
the General Manager of Letao,

20
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:05,735
also a longtime family friend.

21
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,775
Haiming, Ou Xiaojue
is my classmate from school.

22
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:09,495
He's also my...

23
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,215
Hello, Mr. Gao.
I've heard a lot about you.

24
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:16,615
(Could this be my freeloading boyfriend
I've never met?)

25
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:20,655
So that makes us alumni too.

26
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,136
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ou.

27
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,696
He's really impressive.

28
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:30,576
I was planning to formally introduce him
to you at a proper time.

29
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,016
Didn't expect we'd meet like this.

30
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:33,335
Really?

31
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,775
By the way, this is Miss Lin,

32
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:38,816
my assistant.

33
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:40,856
What a coincidence.

34
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,576
I remember you had a close
male classmate studying in the UK.

35
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:48,775
He also had the surname Ou, right?

36
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:55,016
And he dumped a girlfriend
he'd been with for a long time.

37
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,136
Of course, I'm not talking about you.

38
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:58,935
Don't misunderstand.

39
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,016
What a coincidence.

40
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:05,608
There should be a bigger coincidence,
shouldn't there, Xiaojue?

41
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,175
You two know each other?

42
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,296
Yes.

43
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:20,175
Miss Lin and I
are high school classmates.

44
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,096
Yes, we're old classmates.

45
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:26,976
Why so nervous?

46
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,576
Aren't you happy
to see an old classmate?

47
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:30,376
Yes!

48
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,055
Of course, I'm happy.

49
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:34,296
I've long heard of Mr. Gao.

50
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,215
Never expected

51
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:39,016
that my old classmate
became Mr. Gao's special assistant.

52
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:40,376
Truly enviable.

53
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,495
I'm the one who envies you.

54
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:46,136
To be classmates now with such
an outstanding person as Miss Cheng,

55
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,055
I really admire you.

56
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,935
Wait, I'm a bit confused.

57
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,455
Are all your classmate relationships
this complicated?

58
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:00,376
Die'en, your father mentioned
you might have a boyfriend.

59
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:10,016
What? Getting gossipy
right after meeting?

60
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,495
No, I just wanted to meet him.

61
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:13,976
Shall I give you a lift?

62
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,576
No need. Someone's picking us up.

63
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:18,816
Then we'll head off first.

64
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:20,095
Alright, see you.

65
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,736
Bye.

66
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,496
The car's over there.

67
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,256
What's wrong? Upset?

68
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:20,816
Why did you tell Gao Haiming
I'm your classmate?

69
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:27,496
So that's what bothers you.

70
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:31,936
I wanted to wait for the right moment
to formally introduce our relationship.

71
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:38,295
But why haven't I heard you mention
having another classmate also in the UK?

72
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,295
Don't you know me?

73
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:44,616
I was always focused on studying,

74
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,215
oblivious to the outside world.

75
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,295
But I heard that classmate abandoned...

76
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,696
Things half a world away
are often just rumors.

77
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:03,496
That Miss Lin made quite
a good first impression on me today.

78
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,696
Shouldn't I get
to know your world better

79
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,816
and know more
about your friends and family?

80
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,655
We just got back.

81
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:19,215
There's still so much to handle.

82
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:20,855
Can it wait a while?

83
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:24,095
Die'en,

84
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,775
your parents haven't accepted me yet.

85
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,936
And the place I'm living
is provided by you.

86
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:31,975
I want to work hard
and achieve something significant.

87
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:33,975
Only then will I be worthy.

88
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:37,256
I believe you are the best.

89
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:38,616
Just settle in here properly.

90
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:41,616
I'll help you
figure out your job situation.

91
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,016
Die'en, how are you so good?

92
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:46,655
Hug.

93
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:47,895
Okay.

94
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:55,848
(Building 8)

95
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,655
Haiming.

96
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:03,895
Mom.

97
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,576
You're back.

98
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,256
I'm sorry for making you worry.

99
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:23,176
You're back.

100
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:25,496
It's good that you're back.

101
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,215
It's good that you're back.

102
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:39,576
It's okay now.

103
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:47,496
I'm fine, Mom.

104
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,095
Mom.

105
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:51,616
It's okay, Mom.

106
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:52,855
It's okay.

107
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,415
Drink less coffee.

108
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,736
You'll lose sleep.

109
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:10,855
It hurts your health.

110
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,215
You need sleep. I don't.

111
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:16,256
Shouldn't I work several jobs
to support your studies

112
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,215
and give you money?

113
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:18,415
I have to support you.

114
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,295
This guy needs a woman to support him.

115
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:23,816
Huan'er, I...

116
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,335
I know what you want to say.

117
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:27,616
You want to say,

118
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,975
"Take care of yourself
when you're alone."

119
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,895
"Otherwise, I'll worry." Right?

120
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:35,935
You know me after all.

121
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,175
You don't know

122
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,815
how much I missed you
when I was alone abroad.

123
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:42,616
I was always concerned about you.

124
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,016
Then why did you go abroad alone

125
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,815
and came back with another woman?

126
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,575
I was about to explain.

127
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:51,720
Huan'er, you know what?

128
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:53,336
I'm really in pain.

129
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,655
I know I should have
only you in my heart.

130
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:56,415
No one else.

131
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:57,575
I don't deny

132
00:08:58,175 --> 00:08:59,616
the fact that Die'en did move me.

133
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,736
At every sleepless night abroad,

134
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:03,096
I couldn't forgive myself.

135
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,376
There was always a voice reminding me.

136
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:07,175
There's only you in my heart.

137
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,456
Sorry, it's just that...

138
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,136
May I ask you something?

139
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,456
How can you describe cheating
and freeloading so affectionately?

140
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,895
Huan'er, how can you say that?

141
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,496
Warning! Warning!

142
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,496
No spoilers!

143
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:24,856
Do not alter relationships.

144
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,856
During all my years in the UK,

145
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,376
the money you sent me was little,

146
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,695
and you weren't by my side.

147
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:32,496
No blame, right?

148
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,016
Warning! Warning!

149
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:35,695
After all this time,

150
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:37,856
have you ever understood my pressure?

151
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,055
I didn't want to hurt you,

152
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,695
so I held back a lot.

153
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:50,575
Huan,

154
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,295
you have to forgive me.

155
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:59,456
You selfish, insecure, cowardly fool!

156
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,016
You simply have a personality disorder!

157
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,136
You live in your own world,

158
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,136
self-centered.

159
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,136
You think you're talented
and are smug about it.

160
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,695
You want to fulfill your needs
by controlling others' emotions.

161
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,136
I'm telling you. This is a sickness!

162
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,535
A serious one. Need treatment!

163
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,856
Forget it. Curing someone like you
is a waste of drug.

164
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:13,895
You just can't be cured.

165
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:14,935
You're hopeless.

166
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:17,336
You don't deserve to live in this world.

167
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:20,256
Do not alter the character's path.

168
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:21,895
Triggered the punishment mechanism.

169
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:23,055
Time Rewind.

170
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:24,535
Two chances left.

171
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:25,935
The system auto-locks.

172
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,695
You will never return to your world.

173
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,295
Huan, you have to forgive me.

174
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,175
Fine, tell me.

175
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:40,655
How can I forgive you?

176
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,336
Huan,

177
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,456
I know you hold resentment

178
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:50,456
about Die'en.

179
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,096
I also understand you're feeling upset.

180
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,175
But I only love you.

181
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:56,895
Let me be honest.

182
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,616
I am just using Die'en.

183
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,376
When I become successful,

184
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:03,575
I definitely won't let you down.

185
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,695
You actually want me to accommodate you.

186
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:14,496
Huan.

187
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,535
Huan.

188
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:21,815
Let's first

189
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:25,976
break up.

190
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,535
But I promise. It's only temporary.

191
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,496
It's a deal.

192
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:32,736
No backing out.

193
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:33,935
You said it yourself.

194
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:36,096
From now on, we're broken up.

195
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:37,695
Don't look for me.

196
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,336
I'm leaving.

197
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:42,935
By the way,

198
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,136
since we've broken up,

199
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,496
the living expenses and tuition
I sent you over the years,

200
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,415
remember to pay me back with interest.

201
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:51,856
Wait, Huan'er.

202
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:53,575
Huan'er.

203
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,535
You can do whatever you want to me.

204
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:59,895
But money isn't necessary, right?

205
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,376
Well...

206
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:13,575
That's better.

207
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:16,456
You said I can do whatever to you.

208
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,216
Remember to repay.

209
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,736
(Letao Tower)

210
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:34,016
This is my upcoming
personal design exhibition.

211
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:36,535
If you have time, you can come and see.

212
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,695
Were these all taken
when you were studying abroad?

213
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,136
Impressive.

214
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:43,096
How is it?

215
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,016
Doesn't it fit perfectly
with the Her Series?

216
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,895
I was wondering why you came to see me.

217
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:48,456
So you're here to give me a gift.

218
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,775
Don't get the wrong idea.

219
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,415
I just really like the slogan
for the Her Series.

220
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:55,655
Seeing women's needs.

221
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:58,575
I didn't expect you
to be so progressive, Haoming.

222
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:00,736
You overestimate me.

223
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,256
That slogan was proposed by Lin Huan'er.

224
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:06,256
She's also responsible
for the overall control of the product.

225
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,256
So it was you who did it.

226
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:10,736
I shouldn't have praised you.

227
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,415
After returning this time,

228
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:14,775
I became very interested
after seeing the Her Series.

229
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,415
So I designed some packaging,

230
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,415
based on your brand's tone.

231
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:21,655
So cute!

232
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,736
I also want to add women's health tips

233
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,496
in comic form on the packaging.

234
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:29,695
Release them randomly
to increase customer loyalty.

235
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:33,736
Also, for packaging slogans on diapers
and other maternal products,

236
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,216
instead of Love from Mom,

237
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,856
change it to Making it Easier for Dad.

238
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:38,856
Good idea.

239
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:43,695
So, can we move forward
with this collaboration with Miss Cheng?

240
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,376
Got it.

241
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,295
I'll go start the process now.

242
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:48,976
Miss Cheng, excuse me.

243
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,136
I hope to have coffee
with you another time.

244
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,295
Good. I was thinking the same thing.

245
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:01,895
Just speak plainly.

246
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,775
If you have time,

247
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,136
I'd like to recommend someone to you.

248
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:16,496
It's that Ou Xiaojue we met
at the airport last time?

249
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,256
Yes. I didn't expect
I couldn't hide anything from you.

250
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:22,976
Do you know him?

251
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:24,935
I know him very well.

252
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,695
He's my classmate.

253
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:27,736
Excellent in everything.

254
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:31,216
He just comes
from a less privileged background.

255
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:33,256
But he's got ambition.

256
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,575
Our last meeting was too rushed.

257
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:37,136
Give him a chance.

258
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,016
He definitely won't disappoint you.

259
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,096
His family isn't well-off.

260
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,256
Studying in Britain isn't cheap.

261
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:45,976
So he's very hardworking.

262
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:50,056
How long have you been together?

263
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:51,376
Us?

264
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:53,736
Almost three years.

265
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,096
Why?

266
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,136
Nothing.

267
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,695
Alright. Have him come for an interview
tomorrow morning.

268
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,535
Great! It's settled then.

269
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:05,655
I'll head out first.

270
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:06,775
See you.

271
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:07,616
Bye.

272
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,856
Miss Cheng, leaving already?

273
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:25,575
Yes.

274
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,575
Our meeting yesterday was rushed.

275
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,216
Didn't even have a proper chat.

276
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:33,295
Ou Xiaojue has changed
quite a bit over the years.

277
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:35,016
I almost didn't recognize him yesterday.

278
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,935
Miss Lin, are you familiar with Xiaojue?

279
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,376
No, not at all.

280
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,456
Please don't misunderstand.

281
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:45,535
I'm really not familiar with him at all.

282
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,376
Nothing between us.

283
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:49,575
Miss Lin, I know.

284
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:52,016
Because Xiaojue told me
he's never dated anyone.

285
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:53,895
Really?

286
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:57,336
He said he's never dated anyone?

287
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,496
No, he really hasn't.

288
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:07,175
You go ahead.

289
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,016
I forgot my things.

290
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:41,695
Hello, Mr. Gao.

291
00:16:57,336 --> 00:17:00,055
Thank you, Mr. Gao, for giving me
this interview opportunity.

292
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,295
Graduated from the University
of St Andrews, right?

293
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,135
Yes, Applied Finance.

294
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,736
During my studies, I...

295
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:25,615
Mr. Ou, your family background
isn't affluent.

296
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,775
How did you afford the tuition?

297
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:31,375
I had scholarships.

298
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:37,375
It says here you only received
two scholarships, each for 100 pounds.

299
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:41,615
So I often did work-study.

300
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,295
What kind of work?
What was the hourly wage?

301
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:47,855
Cashier at a restaurant.

302
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:49,575
Hourly wage...

303
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:54,696
20 pounds?

304
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,176
Roughly.

305
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:01,896
Seems inflation in the UK
is quite severe.

306
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:04,896
When I worked there five years ago,

307
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,656
the hourly wage was only 3 pounds.

308
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:14,815
Mr. Gao, I don't remember
these minor details very clearly.

309
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,575
But I think you could
assess my abilities more.

310
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:22,575
Regarding my studies
and achievements on my resume,

311
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:23,775
there's no falsification.

312
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,375
If you could give me a chance,

313
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:30,256
I'll prove to Letao
that I'm a trustworthy employee.

314
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:34,095
But based on the information I have,

315
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:39,095
the excellent academic performance
you claim doesn't seem very convincing.

316
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,176
Mr. Gao, you've noticed it.

317
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:46,496
My family situation is difficult.

318
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,216
But I don't want to depend on others.

319
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:53,055
So I had to work more shifts
and couldn't focus on studies.

320
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,815
Work more shifts?

321
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,496
From what I know,

322
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:59,095
someone's been sending you money
from home for your education.

323
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:00,416
Isn't that true?

324
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,416
No.

325
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,896
Mr. Gao, did someone tell you something?

326
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,095
Could there be some...

327
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:22,295
It seems nothing escapes you, Mr. Gao.

328
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,496
I did have a girlfriend.

329
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,295
She did fund my overseas studies.

330
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,496
But while I was abroad,

331
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:37,832
she couldn't handle the loneliness
and fell for someone else.

332
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:40,775
When I found out,

333
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:42,016
I was devastated.

334
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:45,295
I was determined to come back
and marry her.

335
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,456
I wanted to give her a good life.

336
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:48,295
Never imagined...

337
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:51,135
Right during that period,

338
00:19:52,295 --> 00:19:53,855
Die'en gave me tremendous comfort.

339
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:55,775
We naturally grew close.

340
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,055
After losing love,
I learned to cherish more deeply.

341
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,736
Mr. Gao, please give me a chance.

342
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:05,615
I'll work hard and earn money diligently

343
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:06,815
to become worthy of Die'en.

344
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:13,095
Money must be repaid.

345
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:14,736
Yes.

346
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:15,456
Moreover,

347
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:17,696
Die'en is a good girl.

348
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:19,976
I hope you'll cherish her.

349
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:22,416
Take this.

350
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:32,335
Mr. Gao.

351
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,855
Please sign this document.

352
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,095
(I really like the phone charm
you gave me. Thank you.)

353
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:02,615
I'm leaving.

354
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,176
Lin Huan'er!

355
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,135
No wonder you broke up so decisively.

356
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,295
Turns out you found someone better.

357
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,375
I really underestimated you.

358
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:32,736
Who is it?

359
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:33,855
Hello, sir.

360
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:35,016
Need cleaning service?

361
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:39,656
Hello, sir.

362
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:40,535
Need cleaning service?

363
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:41,615
What cleaning service?

364
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:45,656
What does this say?

365
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:46,736
Do not disturb.

366
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:47,615
Can you read this?

367
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:48,680
Are you illiterate?

368
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:51,176
- I'm sorry.
- Never seen such poor service abroad!

369
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,416
Sorry for disturbing you.

370
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,016
Get lost!

371
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,775
Miss Lin, Haiming trusts you deeply.

372
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,496
I hope we can collaborate soon.

373
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:03,936
Mr. Gao is truly a good person.

374
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,216
He takes good care of his subordinates.

375
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,936
But his greatest strength

376
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,535
is his consistency.

377
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:14,295
Unlike some two-faced people
who say one thing

378
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,295
but mean another.

379
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,095
You never know

380
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:18,696
whether what they show you
is genuine or an act.

381
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,335
Appearances can be deceiving.

382
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:24,815
That's terrifying, isn't it, Miss Cheng?

383
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:26,736
Yes.

384
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:28,615
Please go ahead.

385
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,496
I forgot something.

386
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:39,095
Didn't I say...

387
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:41,095
Die'en?

388
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:42,815
What brings you here?

389
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:45,615
I thought you'd be busy until late.

390
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,095
Why the sudden visit?

391
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,335
Finished early, so I came to see you.

392
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,055
How did the interview go?

393
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,095
I feel Mr. Gao's philosophy and mine

394
00:22:58,095 --> 00:22:58,936
don't quite align.

395
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:02,095
Though Letao is a major company,

396
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,976
I don't want to work
where I can't utilize my strengths.

397
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,176
I appreciate your introduction though.

398
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,016
I feel bad for wasting your effort.

399
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:13,535
It's fine.

400
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:15,256
I'll find other
job opportunities for you.

401
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:21,176
Today I discussed my design concepts
with Gao Haiming.

402
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:24,936
Your high school classmate Miss Lin
was there too.

403
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:27,896
Really?

404
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,496
How was your talk with Mr. Gao?

405
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,216
Can you partner?

406
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:36,216
Should be possible.

407
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:39,176
Miss Lin and I
share similar design philosophies.

408
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,176
We got along quite well.

409
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:47,696
Were you close in school?

410
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:50,815
Fairly.

411
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,896
You know, I used to be very innocent.

412
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:54,055
I just focused on studying.

413
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:55,696
I hated talking
to female classmates most.

414
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:02,936
What?

415
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:06,216
You're not jealous
of me and her, are you?

416
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:09,575
She's just an ordinary classmate.

417
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,128
I'm not jealous of you
and Gao Haiming yet.

418
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:21,176
I'll figure something out
for your work situation.

419
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:24,095
You keep working. I'm leaving.

420
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:26,016
Leaving so soon?

421
00:24:28,496 --> 00:24:29,696
Really not stay for dinner?

422
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,095
No.

423
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,936
Let me walk you out.

424
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:32,736
It's fine.

425
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:34,855
You keep working. Bye.

426
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:38,736
Be safe.

427
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,055
Got it.

428
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,095
Text me when you get home.

429
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:41,736
Okay.

430
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:43,295
Bye.

431
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,135
Text me, okay?

432
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:01,496
Qiuzi, call Ziqiang and the others.

433
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:02,976
I have a big announcement.

434
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:09,896
Because Xiaojue told me
he's never dated anyone.

435
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,055
Really?

436
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:15,295
He said he's never dated anyone?

437
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:21,456
No, he really hasn't.

438
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:37,535
Silly Goose.

439
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,176
You're here.

440
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:39,944
Baked sweet potato for you.

441
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,256
You eat it.

442
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:54,295
Let's share.

443
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:00,176
Why do you want to see me?

444
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:08,976
Xiaojue is back, you know?

445
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:10,496
I know.

446
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,976
Why bring him up?
You're ruining the mood.

447
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:16,936
No, we're all classmates.

448
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:21,615
Zhou Yuan, Ziqiang.

449
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:25,016
Don't be fooled
by how put-together I look now.

450
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:27,335
Dressed all fancy.

451
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,696
Overseas, I was just like that waiter.

452
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,936
Just serving tea and water, you know?

453
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,656
I washed dishes every single day.

454
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:35,775
Countless dishes.

455
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:36,775
Look at my hands.

456
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:43,216
Qiuzi, you're close with Huan'er.

457
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,615
But I'll be honest with you all.

458
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,295
She acts different around you
than she does with me.

459
00:26:49,295 --> 00:26:50,095
You know?

460
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,615
I've been so wronged.

461
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,295
You have no idea
what kind of person she really is.

462
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:57,456
Come on.

463
00:26:58,135 --> 00:26:58,952
- Wipe your tears.
- I never expected

464
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,016
that meek Lin Huan'er

465
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:03,135
would turn out like this.

466
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,216
Yeah, wake up already.

467
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:06,375
We're not in school anymore.

468
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,295
Stop playing innocent.

469
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,456
I shouldn't even
be telling you some of this.

470
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,775
But I'm just so frustrated inside.

471
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,375
Come on.

472
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:14,135
Drink up.

473
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:14,775
Bottoms up.

474
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:24,656
It's fine. This'll blow over.

475
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,535
(Huan'er dumped Xiaojue. Is that true?)
After all, you can't judge someone

476
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:28,335
at first glance.

477
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,295
Mengmeng, Xiaojue told me something.

478
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,095
It's nothing serious, really.

479
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:41,135
(Huan'er dumped Xiaojue. Is that true?)
It's just Xiao...

480
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:42,615
What's wrong?

481
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:44,936
Silly Goose, let's go.

482
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:46,775
Let's go, Silly Goose.

483
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,976
Wait, Mengmeng...

484
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:55,216
Xiaojue, what are you going to do now?

485
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,176
What can I possibly do?

486
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:00,016
She's climbed up high.

487
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:01,416
I wish her happiness.

488
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:06,456
Honestly, a hypocritical snake like her,

489
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,095
who forgets old bonds,

490
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:09,295
doesn't deserve kindness.

491
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,016
But I remember old bonds, right?

492
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,575
We've got your back.
No one messes with us!

493
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:14,575
Move!

494
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:18,896
Say that again?

495
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,256
Mengmeng, how are you here?

496
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:23,896
She worked herself to the bone
to send you abroad.

497
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:24,696
Now you're back,

498
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,095
and this is how you describe her?

499
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,896
Do you have any conscience?

500
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:29,896
No conscience at all? I'll kill you!

501
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,375
No, Mengmeng. Let me explain.

502
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,696
- No conscience at all?
- Let me explain.

503
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:33,535
Explain what?

504
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:34,535
- Mengmeng!
- Explain what?

505
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:34,976
Mengmeng.

506
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:37,696
- Mengmeng!
- Stop... Mengmeng!

507
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:38,575
You asked for this!

508
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:39,815
- Tiehan!
- You asked for this!

509
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,176
Ask him if you doubt!

510
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,575
Tiehan knows everything.

511
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:47,575
You know it too?

512
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:58,952
(He says the opposite meaning straight.)

513
00:28:59,176 --> 00:28:59,736
Mengmeng.

514
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:01,815
Mengmeng.

515
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:02,815
Don't be angry.

516
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:04,256
Don't follow me!

517
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:06,855
Wait, listen to me.

518
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:09,176
Mengmeng, yes...

519
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:11,416
Don't be angry.

520
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:12,696
I know everything.

521
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:14,815
Xiaojue came to see me.

522
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:17,256
He said Huan'er wanted to break up
after he returned.

523
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,575
He's actually heartbroken too.

524
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,896
He kept asking how to win Huan'er back.

525
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,416
He blamed the victim first!

526
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,375
Do you believe everything he says?

527
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,656
Don't you know what kind
of person Huan'er is?

528
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,095
She worked so hard
with multiple jobs every day,

529
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:32,416
running off her feet

530
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,216
just to send him money.

531
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,055
Now she finally got into Letao

532
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:37,375
and finally settled down.

533
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:38,855
Yet he comes back and slanders her?

534
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:06,496
But Huan'er's been alone here
all this time.

535
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:09,095
Who's to say there weren't issues?

536
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,896
How dare you say that about her!

537
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,815
Great now.

538
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:18,416
Huan'er's seen as a gold-digger
who only cares about money!

539
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:21,176
If Ou Xiaojue truly wanted her back,

540
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,496
would he badmouth her
in front of everyone?

541
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:26,095
Doesn't he know
what this would do to her?

542
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:28,736
Mengmeng.

543
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:33,295
- The four of us...
- Stop following me!

544
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:48,295
Mengmeng.

545
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:50,696
Mengmeng.

546
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,736
Why are you sitting here alone?

547
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:54,855
Aren't you cold?

548
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:57,496
What's wrong?

549
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:05,216
Let me guess then.

550
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,496
Did your fairytale romance shatter?

551
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:11,375
You already know?

552
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:14,656
I was figuring out how to tell you.

553
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:16,615
It's no big deal.

554
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:18,896
It's just that he cheated in the UK.

555
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:20,135
I'll just dump him.

556
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:21,855
He cheated?

557
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,256
He actually cheated?

558
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,216
You didn't know?

559
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,976
I should've smashed
that beer bottle over his head.

560
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:29,216
No need for that.

561
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,855
I'm going right now.

562
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,416
Mengmeng, calm down.

563
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,095
Let me go!

564
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,615
Mengmeng!

565
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:36,496
Listen to me.

566
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,496
Go home first.

567
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:39,615
I know you're furious.

568
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:40,575
Calm down first.

569
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:41,696
Alright.

570
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:43,896
That Ou Xiaojue, I...

571
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:45,256
Alright.

572
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,375
Look. I'm not even sad over him.

573
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,416
So you shouldn't be angry either.

574
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,496
Getting so angry over a shameless fool.

575
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:53,456
Is it worth it?

576
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,016
I just feel so bad for you.

577
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,416
You did so much for him all these years.

578
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,976
So I need to cut my losses now.

579
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:04,016
I can't waste another second on him,

580
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:07,496
right?

581
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,135
But we can't let him off so easy.

582
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:13,176
Just let him walk away?

583
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:14,496
How can we let him off?

584
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,815
He's already smeared me.

585
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:17,095
We have to hit back!

586
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,375
Yes, hit back!

587
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,456
Can we go home now?

588
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,016
Let's go home together.

589
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:35,335
Alright. No more anger, okay?

590
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:46,496
Fuchuang pulled our products

591
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:47,496
as expected.

592
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,375
How's the new product coming?

593
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,416
Dr. Wei's core tech upgrades
are successful.

594
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,624
Finished products are ready.
You can inspect anytime.

595
00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:59,055
But we're hitting snags
with distributors.

596
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:02,696
The northern market's too conservative.

597
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,775
Breaking into the East
is more strategic now.

598
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:10,855
Xinye is based in Lvcheng,

599
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,496
but their distribution network
in the East is solid.

600
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:14,575
Worth prioritizing.

601
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:15,575
Also these two.

602
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,095
- Huineng...
- Lvcheng will do.

603
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,496
Schedule visits.

604
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:18,976
Okay.

605
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,095
Miss Cheng.

606
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:29,016
Surprised you invited me here.

607
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:30,295
Any new proposal?

608
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,295
Miss Cheng.

609
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:33,176
Where's Miss Lin?

610
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:35,575
Let's talk. It's personal.

611
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:39,256
You wanted to talk to me?

612
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,575
The matter is somewhat serious.

613
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:48,040
(Letao Tower)

614
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:55,896
Miss Cheng.

615
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:58,815
Miss Lin, you're here.

616
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,696
I was just looking for you.

617
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:01,416
Here's the thing.

618
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,216
I have a friend.

619
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,216
She's a comic artist.

620
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:06,216
She saw the packaging design
you recently did for the Her Series.

621
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:08,456
She really liked it
and admired it a lot.

622
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:10,615
This is a comic she recently drew.

623
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:15,615
It tells the story of a fool
borrowing money from his girlfriend.

624
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:19,215
She hopes you could take a look,

625
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:20,095
giving some guidance.

626
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:25,255
Guidance is too strong a word.

627
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,416
Call it an exchange of ideas.

628
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:28,200
I'll read it later.

629
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,416
Thank you, Miss Lin.

630
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:31,456
Take care.
