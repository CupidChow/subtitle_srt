=My Page in the 90s=
(Adapted from "Bye, Wild Weasel")

11
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,056
(Bye, Wild Weasel)

12
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:57,257
(A polished-to-a-shine Maybach is parked
under the office.)

13
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,817
(A suited man pushes the car door open.)

14
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:05,416
(An exceptionally handsome
and tall man came into view.)

15
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,617
(He raises an eyebrow.)

16
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,217
(He's wearing gold-rimmed glasses.)

17
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:11,696
(His sharp gaze is hidden
behind the lenses.)

18
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:13,057
(He glances down.)

19
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:14,416
(A high bridge nose.)

20
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:00,040
=Episode 1=

21
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,377
After your acquisition of our company,

22
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,537
your group's resources
will be bolstered.

23
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,097
Currently,
about one-third of the streamers,

24
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:12,217
I mean the top streamers,

25
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,777
work for my company.

26
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:14,896
Mr. Gao.

27
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:16,616
Two of our female streamers

28
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:21,236
are doing a live PK battle
about the novel "Bye, Wild Weasel".

29
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,136
Want to take a look?

30
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:22,636
Sure.

31
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:26,977
(The female lead
in the book "Bye, Wild Weasel",)

32
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:28,537
(was far too dependent on love.)

33
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:29,977
(Personally, I believe)

34
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:33,016
love isn't a necessity in life.

35
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:35,817
It's merely a little dessert
after the main course.

36
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:37,736
(Huan'er made a good point.)

37
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:41,777
(But I heard
you haven't had much dating experience.)

38
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,937
- (In that case,)
- Ai Qing isn't following the script.

39
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,337
(how do you understand love?)

40
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,777
(What kind of person
do you consider a true love expert?)

41
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,696
(Is it someone
who's in only one relationship)

42
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,977
(or someone who's constantly falling in
and out of love?)

43
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,537
(That's exactly why I'm here
to share my experience.)

44
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:00,977
(Create a romantic moment.)

45
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,777
(Or use certain props
to achieve your goal,)

46
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:07,537
(fluffy pets, for instance.)

47
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,257
(Your ideas are so cliché.)

48
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:13,696
(The values from the old-school dramas
don't fit modern society anymore.)

49
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:15,856
That's where you're mistaken.

50
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:19,616
Touch, hugs, and kisses,

51
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:23,856
these all build trust and intimacy.

52
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:26,337
(Ai Qing,
how exactly do you understand love?)

53
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:28,777
(The female lead in this book,)

54
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,936
(if not for the author's intervention,)

55
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,416
could've been cheated many times.

56
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,777
(What exactly did she do
to win a man's heart?)

57
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:37,496
Moreover, I'd like to ask
about the men in this book.

58
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:39,577
(Which one is truly worth loving?)

59
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:41,217
Not worth it?

60
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,256
(Sweetie, a word of advice...)

61
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:46,697
What's wrong?

62
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:49,217
Huan'er, Mr. Zeng ordered it shut down.

63
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,296
This is Ai Qing.

64
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:54,337
This streamer is hugely popular
with audiences right now.

65
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:56,856
I gave her that name.

66
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,457
It perfectly matches her appearance.

67
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,537
My company is building...

68
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:01,856
Why did you cut my stream?

69
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:04,897
Who let you in?

70
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,416
I'm meeting a guest.

71
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:07,537
Don't barge in.

72
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:09,777
I didn't make any mistakes on stream.

73
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,017
A book reflects its era.

74
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,657
Take the book "Bye, Wild Weasel",

75
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,296
its values are outdated
by today's standards.

76
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:18,296
Its values shouldn't be endorsed.

77
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:21,496
A girl pitifully sacrificing everything
for a man

78
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,056
just to win a man's love.

79
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,176
That's wrong.

80
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,496
It's not a good thing.

81
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,657
If she's lucky,

82
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:27,657
she might be happy.

83
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,017
What if she's not?

84
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,056
Her life could be ruined.

85
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,616
Could you leave?

86
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:32,777
Talk later.

87
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:33,936
That's all I have to say.

88
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:34,816
Restore my stream.

89
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:35,616
Or I quit.

90
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:37,736
Lin Huan'er.

91
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:59,697
Could you host another stream
on the book, Bye, Wild Weasel?

92
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:02,936
I'll be watching.

93
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,296
And you are?

94
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:15,457
This is the potential buyer
of our company.

95
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,496
Do you really think none of the men
in this book are worth loving?

96
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:25,056
Well...

97
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,537
Once Mr. Zeng restores my stream,

98
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,056
you'll hear my answer tonight.

99
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:47,736
Restore.

100
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,017
(Do you know what this is?)

101
00:06:57,137 --> 00:07:00,577
This is a pager,
hugely popular before the millennium.

102
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:02,337
Do you know its function?

103
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,056
If someone wanted to reach you,

104
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,376
they'd send a message
to the paging service.

105
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,176
Your pager would receive it.

106
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,897
Then you'd have to find a phone

107
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,137
and call them back.

108
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,496
Inconvenient, right?

109
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:17,736
Frankly, it was just a tool
dependent on telephones.

110
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,416
It lacked its own vitality.

111
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,097
No surprise it's obsolete now.

112
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,296
Sweetie, a word of advice,

113
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,577
we're the service providers at work.

114
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:28,970
Don't play that role
in relationships too.

115
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,616
(It'd be quite something if you were
the female lead of the novel.)

116
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:33,176
I could never be the female lead.

117
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,577
The only thing
I share with her is the name.

118
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,097
Otherwise, we're nothing alike.

119
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:40,256
Now, let's talk about this.

120
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:44,376
This is the hero's favorite toy
in the book.

121
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,777
It's a model
of the weasel-shaped warcraft.

122
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,337
It looks exquisite.

123
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:53,296
But here's its fatal flaw.

124
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,137
You have to assemble it yourself.

125
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:56,697
It's incredibly fragile.

126
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,856
The slightest bump could shatter it.

127
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,816
Sounds like love, right?

128
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,057
Isn't the museum closed today?

129
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:24,337
Who are you?

130
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,656
Why are you here?

131
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:36,697
It's you!

132
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:40,656
Who exactly are you?

133
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:42,817
How did I get here?

134
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,457
Why is my head so fuzzy?

135
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,057
Did you bring me here?

136
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,817
It's 1999 already.

137
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:52,496
I suggest you watch your words.

138
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:53,856
Please leave.

139
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,896
1999? What do you mean?

140
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:02,656
Stop!

141
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:04,057
Miss.

142
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,417
You broke something.

143
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,977
You think you can leave?

144
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:08,656
Another one?

145
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:09,536
Who are you?

146
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:10,937
I'll pay!

147
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,376
Huan'er, are you alright?

148
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,057
Who are you?

149
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,697
What's wrong?

150
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:17,337
This isn't right.

151
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,656
Shouldn't I be live-streaming now?

152
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:21,536
Where on earth am I?

153
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:21,896
Stop!

154
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,057
- Pay up!
- I will!

155
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,297
Leave her alone.

156
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,177
How much?

157
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:26,896
Get me out of here!

158
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:30,656
Welcome to the world
of the book "Bye, Wild Weasel".

159
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,872
(Welcome to the world
of the book "Bye, Wild Weasel")

160
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:37,656
I'm hallucinating.

161
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,417
Must be low blood sugar.

162
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:42,217
Well...

163
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,937
Isn't this the pager prop
I use for my streams?

164
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:52,016
How did it get here?

165
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,376
As the female lead of this game,

166
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,736
please follow the rules

167
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,057
to complete your quests.

168
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,057
I'm sorry?

169
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:02,896
Are you telling me

170
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,177
that I'm inside the old romance novel?

171
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,536
Yes. The rules are as follows.

172
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:12,977
First, do not reveal, in any form,
to non-player characters in the story.

173
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,008
Second, don't change the relationship
between the male lead and female lead.

174
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,856
Third, do not let anyone
in the book know your true identity.

175
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,177
Otherwise,
the penalty system will activate.

176
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:22,417
This is insane!

177
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,057
To help you integrate into the story,

178
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,016
the system will issue a Newbie Pack.

179
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:27,896
Please check for it.

180
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:31,016
Come on! Forget the pack!

181
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,496
Just get me out of here! Got it?

182
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,217
Out!

183
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:35,417
No, wait...

184
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,736
This has to be a dream.

185
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:43,697
Right here.

186
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:58,177
Sir, is everything okay?

187
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,177
What's the noise?

188
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,977
Nothing. I just ran into a freak.

189
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:07,417
Huan'er?

190
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:08,817
What's wrong?

191
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,297
Do you need a hospital?

192
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:16,297
I get it.

193
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:19,057
You know what's going on, don't you?

194
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,376
Can you explain this to me?

195
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,057
What's wrong?

196
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:23,177
Are you alright?

197
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,536
Is that the only line you know?

198
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,616
Can you say something else?

199
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,736
What's wrong, Huan'er?

200
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:28,697
Okay, tell me.

201
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:29,697
What's your name?

202
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,337
What's wrong?

203
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:37,896
Name! Just the name!

204
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:41,297
For example,
I'm Lin Huan'er. Who are you?

205
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,016
I'm Mengmeng.

206
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:44,977
Zhu Mengmeng.

207
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,376
- Zhu Mengmeng?
- What's wrong?

208
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,937
- Mengmeng?
- You don't remember me?

209
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:48,776
Vaguely.

210
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,736
You're Lin Huan'er's childhood friend
in the book,

211
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,616
a rich, beautiful cartoonist, right?

212
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:57,177
Oh, thank goodness! You remember me!

213
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,656
Anyway, whether this is some prank game,

214
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,697
a live-action show, VR, or whatever,

215
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:05,656
our top priority is finding clues
and getting out, right?

216
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,337
Otherwise, NPCs can't get off work.

217
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:09,376
Come on. Assign the quest.

218
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,097
What's wrong?

219
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:12,697
Huan'er?

220
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,937
Your assignment method
is seriously old-school.

221
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,656
Congratulations!
You've received the Newbie Pack.

222
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,217
Now, please complete your first quest.

223
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,616
Wire 10,000 to Ou Xiaojue.

224
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,577
Who is Ou Xiaojue?

225
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:29,536
Who is Ou Xiaojue?

226
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,417
Huan'er, what's wrong?

227
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,616
Why is your memory fragmented?

228
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:33,817
Why are you saying that again?

229
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:34,656
Never mind.

230
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:35,817
Just be quiet.

231
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:37,297
Let me sort this out.

232
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,177
Ou Xiaojue is...

233
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,057
Ou...

234
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:46,817
Is Ou Xiaojue the bad boyfriend
of Lin Huan'er in the book?

235
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,297
The guy who cheated on her?

236
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,856
Seems my memory's good.

237
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,297
But why must
Lin Huan'er love Ou Xiaojue?

238
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,057
In the book, there is a good man.

239
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,337
I mean the cool guy, Gao...

240
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,577
Player, please follow the rules.

241
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,256
Do not alter their relationships.

242
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:02,256
No spoilers.

243
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,097
Violators will trigger
the penalty system,

244
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:05,097
initiating Time Rewind.

245
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:06,417
You only have five chances.

246
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:07,536
If all are run out,

247
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:09,097
you'll face awful consequences.

248
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,736
Which genius invented these game rules?

249
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,856
What's the worst that could happen?

250
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,672
Lin Huan'er would break up
with Ou Xiaojue and see someone else.

251
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:19,817
Now, only four chances remain.

252
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:21,217
You will be punished.

253
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:22,697
Time Rewind.

254
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:28,697
(Awful system!)

255
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:29,776
(It happened again.)

256
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,256
Huan'er, what's wrong?

257
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,057
Do you need a hospital?

258
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:34,656
I'm fine.

259
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:35,464
I'm okay.

260
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:36,297
You're Zhu Mengmeng.

261
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:36,977
I'm Lin Huan'er.

262
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,217
We are best friends.

263
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,297
Don't talk right now.

264
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,337
Don't ask me if I'm okay.

265
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:45,417
You crappy game system!

266
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:46,896
Do you even have any ethics?

267
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,417
You gave me a main quest
to make a powerful man love me,

268
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,616
but then you forbid me
from changing any relationships?

269
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:53,776
Are you insane?

270
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:55,616
Do not insult the system.

271
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:56,776
Time Rewind.

272
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,337
(Got set up by the system.)

273
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,136
Huan'er, what's wrong?

274
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:06,856
Zhu Mengmeng, right?

275
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,097
Just wait a second.

276
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:09,776
I'm going to fight a lousy system!

277
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,016
Huan'er?

278
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:22,417
What's wrong?

279
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:29,817
Can I break up with him?

280
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,817
It requires the man to initiate it.

281
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,417
Fine! I'll play along with you.

282
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:38,977
Wire the money? I'll wire it.

283
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,016
But isn't 10,000 a bit too much?

284
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:42,217
Even if it's just in a game,

285
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:44,177
I don't want that bad guy
to take advantage of me.

286
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,457
According to the system,

287
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:47,536
you must wire 10,000 to Ou Xiaojue.

288
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,736
If you don't...

289
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:49,616
Enough!

290
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,697
Stop nagging!

291
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:51,417
I'll wire it.

292
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:52,736
10,000, right? Fine.

293
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:57,856
Huan'er,

294
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,817
shall we go to the hospital?

295
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,097
You've been talking to yourself here.

296
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,736
Come on, Zhu Mengmeng!

297
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,536
We should be going
to the bank right now.

298
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:06,856
Take me there. Hurry!

299
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:09,136
Quick! Where's the bank? Let's go!

300
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:10,256
Which way?

301
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:18,097
Letao has been the exclusive agent
for your domestic sales for five years.

302
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:21,097
It's fair to say
we've popularized your company's brands.

303
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:23,177
Renewal terms are negotiable,

304
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,057
but demanding 20% right off the bat?

305
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:27,536
If this is your attitude,

306
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,616
we won't need
to continue this discussion.

307
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:30,536
Sorry.

308
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:35,496
Mr. Gao.

309
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:37,057
Heading back to the company?

310
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:43,896
Oh, the Chairman said you must join
the board meeting tomorrow at 9 AM.

311
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:47,896
The senior board members will go.

312
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,417
Just go and show your face.

313
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,177
New brands will enter the mall
tomorrow morning.

314
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:56,136
Letao is among them.

315
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:57,217
I need to go.

316
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:58,496
I've checked this.

317
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,136
I can adjust your schedule.

318
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:02,536
Got it.

319
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,736
What are you looking at? Let's go!

320
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,217
This place is awesome.

321
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:41,617
Mengmeng.

322
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,736
You're literally my deluxe Newbie Pack.

323
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:47,816
Huan'er, what's wrong?

324
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:49,736
I can't understand anything
you're saying.

325
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:50,736
Are you okay?

326
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,217
It's okay, Mengmeng.

327
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,816
You'll get used to it gradually.

328
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,457
I'll get you something to drink.

329
00:17:59,377 --> 00:17:59,857
Thank you.

330
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:10,728
(Certificates)

331
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:19,937
(Huan'er, I got the money.)

332
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:21,857
(Why is it only 10,000 Vietnamese dong?)

333
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,536
(That's only three yuan in RMB.)

334
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,096
(Did you make a mistake?)

335
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,977
Congratulations
on completing your quest.

336
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,697
You've wired 10,000 to Ou Xiaojue.

337
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:32,377
It worked.

338
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:34,377
Now, I'm issuing the main quest.

339
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:35,417
As the female lead,

340
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:38,496
your ultimate quest is
to date the male lead, Gao Haiming.

341
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:41,496
Only by getting his proposal
can you return to your original world.

342
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:45,096
The male lead's fondness
towards you will be tracked as a KPI.

343
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:45,816
Go for it!

344
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:47,016
Besides,

345
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,137
- So troublesome.
- you'll inhabit this world

346
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:52,096
as Lin Huan'er, live your daily life,
and trigger side quests.

347
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,336
Completion of side quests directly
impacts the reward and penalty

348
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,096
and unlocks hidden quests.

349
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:58,336
Someone's paging you.

350
00:18:59,016 --> 00:18:59,897
It's work-related?

351
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:02,377
Here.

352
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,377
(Attendees: Letao Group, Yunxiang Company,
Huayang Company, Ouzheng Company)

353
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:09,217
(Letao?)

354
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,457
(Sounds so familiar.)

355
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:16,256
(Isn't the male lead, Gao Haiming,
in the novel Letao's general manager?)

356
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:17,800
(It's my chance.)

357
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:19,937
Mengmeng.

358
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:24,217
Let's go to this event together.

359
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,424
(A Feast of Trends;
A Rendezvous with Fashion)

360
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,344
(Letao: Motherly Tenderness)

361
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:31,848
(Grand Opening)

362
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:35,816
Come check it out.

363
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:37,296
Hello, our department store is open.

364
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:38,056
Come on in.

365
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:39,336
(Welcome Key Enterprises to the Mall)

366
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,312
(A Feast of Trends;
A Rendezvous with Fashion)

367
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,217
So many people!

368
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,256
So this is the fanciest mall here?

369
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,177
Yeah.

370
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,697
My friend's calling me. Look around.

371
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,944
(Unite to Move Forward; Win the Future)

372
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:19,096
Let's give a round of applause
to welcome the chairmen

373
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,417
of Huayang Company,

374
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,177
Ouzheng Company,

375
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:23,496
Letao Group,

376
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:26,377
and Yunxiang Company

377
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,736
to cut the ribbon for the mall!

378
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,496
- Great!
- Great!

379
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:32,816
So handsome!

380
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:34,897
So handsome!

381
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:36,816
Mr. Gao is
as handsome as the rumors say.

382
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:38,137
This trip was worth it.

383
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:39,897
This trip was worth it.

384
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:41,056
Yeah.

385
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,457
May it bring thriving business!

386
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:49,056
May it usher in abundant wealth!

387
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:53,377
May it bring a beautiful
and happy life to all citizens!

388
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:58,897
So handsome.

389
00:20:58,897 --> 00:20:59,617
What a hot guy.

390
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:00,617
Which one is Mr. Gao?

391
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,417
That one! That's Mr. Gao.

392
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:03,296
The one in a suit?

393
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,296
Yes! That's him.

394
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:06,536
Yes, he is quite hot.

395
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:16,496
(Gao Haiming)

396
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,296
(is an imposing figure)

397
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:19,377
(with bright eyes.)

398
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,496
(He is also a neat guy
with slightly wavy, soft hair,)

399
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:25,016
(and a faint smile on his lips.)

400
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:28,496
(Yes.)

401
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:29,897
(No doubt.)

402
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:30,736
(It's him.)

403
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,256
(Just as described in the book,)

404
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:36,096
(he is a successful man in the 1990s.)

405
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,176
(Welcome Cocktail Party)

406
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:07,457
(So this is the fancy party in 1999?)

407
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:10,937
(Just so-so.)

408
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:16,617
Mr. Gao.

409
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:17,937
Since you're here,

410
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:19,816
why not mingle more?

411
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,857
I'm here to know about market trends.

412
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,697
Chatting is a waste of time.

413
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,096
Look who's here.

414
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,417
Mr. Gao.

415
00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:35,096
We don't often see you at gatherings.

416
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:39,336
Indeed, Mr. Gao,
you're quite an impressive young man.

417
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:41,977
You should socialize more.

418
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:43,857
Yes, you are both seniors.

419
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:44,617
Can be my teacher.

420
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:47,217
I'm not qualified to teach you.

421
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:49,096
You're doing better than us.

422
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,857
It seems Mr. Gao has real expertise
in women's goods.

423
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:59,256
That's why the industry
calls him the Sanitary Pad King.

424
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:00,897
I'm flattered.

425
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,336
- Sure.
- Look.

426
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:03,697
Mr. Gao is so progressive.

427
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:07,336
He doesn't care about that title at all.

428
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,096
If we were him,

429
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,857
we would feel embarrassed.

430
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:13,897
The millennium is almost here.

431
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:16,056
Young people should be progressive,

432
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:17,336
or we'll be left behind.

433
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,536
I have something else to do.
I have to go.

434
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,056
Sorry about this.

435
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:27,776
No problem.

436
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:29,016
Alright.

437
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:48,977
Huan'er, where did you go?

438
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:49,937
I finally found you.

439
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:53,256
What's going on?

440
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:55,096
I'm looking for my ending.

441
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:56,096
The finale.

442
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:58,296
The finale?

443
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:02,937
Mengmeng,

444
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:05,897
I'm so glad
we got to be friends for a day.

445
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:07,736
But now it's time to say goodbye.

446
00:24:08,857 --> 00:24:09,576
Goodbye?

447
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:11,816
What's wrong?

448
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:12,937
You're acting strange.

449
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:13,657
Don't scare me.

450
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:14,977
Do you know what you're saying?

451
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,617
I absolutely know what I'm saying.

452
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:18,536
I'm grateful to you.

453
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,816
My Newbie Pack.

454
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:23,576
Promise me
you'll be happy in this world.

455
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:24,576
I'm leaving.

456
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,457
What's wrong with her?

457
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,576
Hello, I'm Lin Huan'er.

458
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,377
(Smile, eye contact,)

459
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:05,776
(raised eyebrows,)

460
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:06,857
(and zygomatic muscles.)

461
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:08,776
(Activated prefrontal cortex shows)

462
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,657
(if he has feelings for me.)

463
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:14,937
(Gao Haiming, your answer is)

464
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,336
(yes.)

465
00:25:20,857 --> 00:25:21,776
You're stunning.

466
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:23,377
Thank you.

467
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:25,897
Your makeup is quite distinctive too.

468
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:27,056
I made it.

469
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,496
If you'll excuse me.

470
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:33,417
Of course.

471
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:46,984
Hello.

472
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,937
Chairman.

473
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:52,217
What were you talking about
at the party?

474
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:54,657
I didn't say much.

475
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:56,496
They were the ones being rude.

476
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:58,977
They're elders, after all.

477
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,657
What you did tonight
makes you seem flippant.

478
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:04,697
I don't think their opinions matter.

479
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,056
Harmony brings prosperity in business.
Understand?

480
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:09,377
One more thing,

481
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:13,096
don't try to weasel
out of tomorrow's blind date.

482
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:15,937
Don't mess it up. Understood?

483
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:20,496
Touch, hugs, and kisses,

484
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:24,857
these all build trust and intimacy.

485
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:27,256
(To make a strong first impression,)

486
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:31,617
(the key step
is subtle physical contact.)

487
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:34,417
(Physical contact?)

488
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,177
(How to create opportunities
for physical contact?)

489
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:50,096
It's you!

490
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:52,536
We meet again.

491
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:54,968
You're not from this world either,
are you?

492
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:56,296
What's your quest?

493
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:58,217
I'm sorry?

494
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:03,016
No spoilers.

495
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:04,296
Got it.

496
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:09,217
You made a chance running into me again?

497
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,657
Last time at the model shop,
you pretended to be confused.

498
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:14,857
Now, you've followed me here.

499
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:19,137
Do you truly not recognize me?

500
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:24,336
Alright.

501
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,536
Seems you're just an NPC.

502
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:27,776
Let's cut to the chase.

503
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,217
Do me a favor.

504
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:30,496
(50 yuan)
It will be yours.

505
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:39,096
So greedy.

506
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,776
Fine. What about now?

507
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:42,952
(100 yuan)

508
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:45,536
Just follow my instructions,

509
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:46,857
and the money will be yours.

510
00:27:48,977 --> 00:27:49,736
Easy money, right?

511
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:53,617
Yes, Madam.

512
00:27:53,617 --> 00:27:55,096
At your service.

513
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:23,056
Sorry.

514
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:23,816
It's okay.

515
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:26,336
What is this?

516
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,177
Helping you up costs extra.

517
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,496
I only asked you to tip over a tray.

518
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:33,056
Why did you bring a whole cart?

519
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,457
Are you purposely causing trouble?

520
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,256
I went above and beyond.

521
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:37,177
200 yuan more.

522
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,217
Are you kidding?

523
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:39,536
I'm trying to help.

524
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:42,217
Are you?
Do you know what I'm trying to do?

525
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,056
I can tell.

526
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,177
Well, may you succeed.

527
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:52,137
(What? What's wrong with this NPC?)

528
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:56,617
Are you okay?

529
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:57,937
I'm fine.

530
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,296
I just felt a bit dizzy earlier.

531
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:04,177
Let me help you over there to rest.

532
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:21,897
Miss Lin,
you were startled just now, weren't you?

533
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,177
No, I wasn't.

534
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,096
Something to drink?

535
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:26,897
I'll get it for you.

536
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:30,816
Let me get it for you.

537
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,072
What do you want to drink?

538
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,217
(Just ignore it.)

539
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:37,137
(This is inside a 90s romance novel.)

540
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:38,296
(He's not a man.)

541
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,857
(He's not even a person.)

542
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,296
(He's just a fictional man.)

543
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,977
(He's the key back to the real world.)

544
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:48,296
I'm leaving.

545
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:57,977
You're married?

546
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:00,657
Aren't you single?

547
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:06,657
Does that matter to us?

548
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,657
Show some respect!

549
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,177
Why did the system
assign someone like you?

550
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:12,977
What system?

551
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:14,977
Miss Lin.

552
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:17,296
Don't think I don't know what you want.

553
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:19,296
Stop pretending.

554
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,576
You bad guy!

555
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:24,096
You're married and still fooling around!

556
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:26,336
Can't you have some respect
for your family?

557
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,177
People are watching.

558
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:29,177
Get out of here.

559
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,056
Let go of me!

560
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,096
Huan'er.

561
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:34,816
Mr. Lu.

562
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:37,576
Mr. Lu?

563
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,336
Isn't your surname Gao?

564
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:42,177
Why?

565
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,576
Aren't you Gao Haiming?

566
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:47,177
(I actually got the wrong person.)

567
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:49,977
Huan'er, what's wrong?

568
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,417
I've had enough of it!

569
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:52,336
I need to vent!

570
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:53,496
I know a place.

571
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,536
Pretty exciting, right?

572
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:03,816
This is way too exciting!

573
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:08,576
A kick!

574
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:11,457
You're dead.

575
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,736
You're so powerful!

576
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,977
(Nine Dragons)

577
00:32:29,977 --> 00:32:31,377
Yes, this is the one!

578
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:32,536
I want this one.

579
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:33,977
Got it!

580
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:36,576
You're amazing!

581
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:37,296
Thanks.

582
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:41,056
I haven't relaxed like this in ages.

583
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,177
You finally smiled.

584
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:44,857
That's great.

585
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,857
You haven't smiled much
since Xiaojue left for England.

586
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:49,857
Is that so?

587
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,457
Huan'er, I really envy you and Xiaojue.

588
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:56,977
Though you're not physically together,

589
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,096
you're still in each other's hearts.

590
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:05,137
That's the kind of love I long for.

591
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:11,697
Seems we don't share the same feelings.

592
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:15,937
Huan'er, what troubles you?

593
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:20,576
Oh, I have way too many troubles.

594
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:22,617
Mengmeng.

595
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:26,857
Didn't you say before
that you think I'm different now?

596
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:30,697
So, do you like the current me better?

597
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:37,096
But I often don't understand

598
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:38,496
what you're talking about.

599
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,417
Doesn't matter.

600
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:42,736
The feeling matters.

601
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:44,417
As long as you feel it.

602
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:46,217
I just want to tell you

603
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:50,776
to cherish Lin Huan'er right now,

604
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:54,536
because she might not stay for long.

605
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,496
See? I don't get it again.

606
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:00,336
Doesn't matter.

607
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:02,296
Eat.

608
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:17,817
What a good cartoonist.

609
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:19,337
Nice drawing.

610
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,297
Have some milk.

611
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:22,216
Thanks.

612
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:27,696
Mengmeng.

613
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:29,777
How have your parents been lately?

614
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,377
Same as always.

615
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:34,297
They're traveling the world.

616
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:36,176
Wonderful.

617
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:38,576
That's exactly the life
I've been dreaming of.

618
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,176
You can't leave freely.

619
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:44,297
You can't leave your dad
and Le'er alone.

620
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,257
(According to the book,)

621
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:51,176
(Lin Huan'er's dad is a kind man,)

622
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:54,136
(and her sister is a strange kid)

623
00:34:54,496 --> 00:34:55,937
(detached from everyone else.)

624
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:58,616
(She gets along well with Lin Huan'er.)

625
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,496
(This should be Lin Le'er.)

626
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:08,817
Mengmeng, when was this photo taken?

627
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:11,176
You forgot this?

628
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,257
It was taken
when we took Le'er back to our school.

629
00:35:20,696 --> 00:35:21,216
What's wrong?

630
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,897
So annoying.
I have to go on a blind date tomorrow.

631
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,536
Just don't go.

632
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:31,257
Absolutely not possible.

633
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:32,457
My family has arranged it.

634
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:34,337
If I don't go,
they'll definitely lecture me.

635
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,056
It's simple.

636
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:37,417
Just go show your face

637
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:38,737
and mess it up.

638
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:40,937
Is that possible?

639
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:45,496
How about you go instead of me?

640
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,536
I don't have much experience.

641
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:49,696
But if you go,
you could definitely mess it up.

642
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:51,817
That's not appropriate.

643
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:54,056
But one thing for sure is

644
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:56,496
that I can mess up your blind date.

645
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:59,536
So I'll go mess it up for you?

646
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:00,337
Really?

647
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,457
You're the best!

648
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:03,536
Come on.

649
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:05,297
Cheers.

650
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:20,777
Sorry to keep you waiting.

651
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:28,457
You're the extra money guy!

652
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,056
