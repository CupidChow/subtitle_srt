12
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,168
You're being overly confident.

13
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,929
Why will Wei Dazhuang succeed?

14
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,448
Because I believe in her.

15
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:55,728
She's always right.

16
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:14,808
Let's drink.

17
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:18,128
I'll have this.

18
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,609
So many stars.

19
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:28,848
Are you drunk?

20
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:31,769
No. Look.

21
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,209
What a beautiful starry sky.

22
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:36,968
Yes.

23
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,209
Autumn night's Milky Way.

24
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:43,968
This is probably the last,
and the best, time to see it this year.

25
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,289
So beautiful.

26
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,169
Actually, as a woman,

27
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,009
from my perspective and standpoint,

28
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,609
I was deeply touched
by what you said today.

29
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,128
To be honest with you,

30
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,688
I used to think
the 'Sanitary Pad King' label

31
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:08,769
was just because of your field.

32
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,329
But I believe after today,

33
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:13,408
you'll give that label

34
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:18,769
a more profound meaning
and greater value.

35
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,329
Starting to label me now?

36
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,169
But I feel there's more you want to say
beyond just today.

37
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,248
Why's that?

38
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,289
Because... Because your eyes told me so.

39
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,408
It's getting chilly. Put this on.

40
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,449
You're so handsome.

41
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,208
Really.

42
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,808
You really are good-looking.

43
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,609
Look.

44
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,128
Look how nice your eyebrows are.

45
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,049
And your eyes are so bling-bling.

46
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:35,568
Do you know 'bling-bling'?

47
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:36,409
Y-You... Take...

48
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,328
How can you be so perfect?

49
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:40,089
What? Are you shy?

50
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,208
I'm not.

51
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,448
Why are you holding my hands?

52
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:48,489
Gao Haiming.

53
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:54,649
Do I really have no charm
in your eyes at all?

54
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,128
Stop this.

55
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,768
I-I'll accuse you of harassment.

56
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:12,768
Get up. Get up first.

57
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:15,409
Get up.

58
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,008
You're really asleep?

59
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,609
Wake up.

60
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:24,169
Don't catch a cold here.

61
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:25,808
Wake up.

62
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:01,808
Alright.

63
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,649
Can you open your eyes now?

64
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,169
I had too much.

65
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:10,808
I know you're not drunk.

66
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,089
So you knew all along.

67
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:16,969
I'll sleep in my car.

68
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,248
Don't go.

69
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,089
Don't sleep in the car.

70
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,089
Just sleep here.

71
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,248
There's space right here.

72
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:25,609
That's not necessary.

73
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:27,929
What scares you?

74
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,649
Listen, if anything happens,

75
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,729
I'll take responsibility.

76
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,049
That's even less necessary.

77
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:32,808
Not necessary.

78
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:36,368
Y-You...

79
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:37,008
Don't go.

80
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:39,888
I'm scared.

81
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,248
Please.

82
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:56,448
I'm begging you.

83
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:27,428
Well...

84
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:29,969
I-I'm going to wash up.

85
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,448
I will go too.

86
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:32,768
Then you go ahead.

87
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:39,808
You go.

88
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:40,688
Okay.

89
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,808
I'm speechless, really.

90
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,248
Like I'd want to watch you?

91
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:05,448
You're overthinking it.

92
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,609
As if I wanted to!

93
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:37,968
What?

94
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,129
Why are you so nervous?

95
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,328
I just wanted to ask if you're cold.

96
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:45,249
I'm not.

97
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,328
That's good.

98
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:48,369
Sleep quickly.

99
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:52,009
Goodnight.

100
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:46,688
Go back.

101
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,889
I must go back.

102
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:55,529
Must succeed.

103
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,369

You're here.

121
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,369
Dr. Wei.

122
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,369
I've sent people
to liaise with the Chuantu Institute.

123
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,328
We'll address your concerns promptly.

124
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,409
We've drawn up an agreement overnight.

125
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,769
It ensures you can focus
on independent R&D for your future work.

126
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,169
You won't need
to deal with any external matters.

127
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,409
For your R&D, the decision-making
is entirely up to you.

128
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,608
If, later on, due to commercial factors,

129
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:19,088
you become dissatisfied
with our investment or raw materials,

130
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,289
you may terminate the agreement anytime.

131
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:25,889
No hurry to reply.

132
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:26,608
Read it first.

133
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,249
I can help you,

134
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,409
but there's one thing
I don't agree with.

135
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:39,529
Who says a woman
can't be named Wei Dazhuang?

136
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,009
You are...

137
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,088
Let me reintroduce myself.

138
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:47,328
I am Wei Dazhuang.

139
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:48,848
Hello.

140
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,009
I really didn't expect this.

141
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:54,848
After being suspended,

142
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:56,968
I was planning
to quit my field for good.

143
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,169
To cheer me up, my brother was taking me

144
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,208
on a cross-country motorbike trip.

145
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:02,409
But you guys,

146
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,328
especially you.

147
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:05,688
Your sincerity these days

148
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,769
has let me see your dedication
to your own work

149
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,568
and reignited my own courage
for my profession.

150
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,088
The motorbike trip can wait.

151
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,529
I'll join you to do my duty first.

152
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,088
Right. Let me introduce him.

153
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,968
This is my brother, Wei Daqiang.

154
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,289
Together,

155
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:23,088
we're WE STRONG.

156
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,129
About the two-day impersonation,

157
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,889
I'm sorry. Please take no offense.

158
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:28,728
Not at all.

159
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:32,529
Then I entrust my sister to both of you.

160
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,328
Rest assured.

161
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,208
One more thing.

162
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,088
For future work,
I'll liaise with just one person.

163
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:39,369
That's her.

164
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,529
Alright, I agree.

165
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:43,249
Good.

166
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,889
Daqiang, I'm off.

167
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:49,649
Let's go.

168
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,968
Safe travels. See you on Route 318.

169
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:53,049
Goodbye.

170
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,169
Mr. Gao,

171
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,568
you did really well.

172
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:01,568
You were good too.

173
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:04,929
What?

174
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,696
(Letao Tower)

175
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,639
(Strong Absorption, Extra Wide)

176
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,968
First, I think
we can lengthen the wings a bit.

177
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,728
This way, it will adhere well
to various fabrics.

178
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,328
Additionally, besides widening the ends,

179
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,289
the front
could also be slightly widened.

180
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,208
Maybe we can make
the front and back indicators

181
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,369
a bit more distinct.

182
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,249
It helps tell them apart.

183
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:15,009
Also, I think

184
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:16,889
we should have a bit of innovation.

185
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,249
Taking cues from the Lovebaby diapers,

186
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:23,208
we could develop
a type of period panties.

187
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:24,769
Good. Great idea.

188
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,169
Great. Makes sense.

189
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:27,568
Regarding the period panties,

190
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,328
comfort must be paramount,

191
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,929
as they're usually worn during sleep.

192
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:34,208
Also, I think the full range of sizes
must be available.

193
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:37,289
This can cater to all women
between 150 cm and 180 cm.

194
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,169
Great.

195
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,049
Alright, that's all my suggestions
for today.

196
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:45,568
Okay, that's all for today then.

197
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,088
Head home soon and rest.

198
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:47,568
Well done.

199
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,328
- Thank you, boss.
- Thank you, boss.

200
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,568
(Seize the chance to get close.)

201
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,129
Are you free?

202
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,129
(How can I get close to him?)

203
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:10,568
(Invite him to a theme park?)

204
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:11,769
(Go shopping? Have dinner?)

205
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:14,488
Attention!

206
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:16,328
The system is issuing a random quest.

207
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,649
You must kiss the male lead
within five minutes.

208
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,769
Failure will result if the time expires.

209
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:21,448
What?

210
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,608
Are you crazy?

211
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,968
Four forty-one, four forty...

212
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,769
Our relationship isn't at that stage.

213
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,529
I can't do something like that,
you know?

214
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,608
Four thirty-three, four thirty-two...

215
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:32,328
You're ridiculous.

216
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:33,568
What will happen if I fail?

217
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:34,728
There will be a punishment.

218
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:38,328
What's wrong?

219
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:48,448
Mr. Gao, I suddenly have some new ideas.

220
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,968
Could we discuss them in your office?

221
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,448
Sure, but I need
to go to the Finance Office right now.

222
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:56,529
Can we talk later?

223
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,848
Three eighteen, three seventeen...

224
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,009
No, I won't make it in time.

225
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:01,328
For what?

226
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:02,728
Finance Office.

227
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,248
Is the Finance Office crowded?

228
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:07,649
I need to go too.

229
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,688
I'll go with you.

230
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,089
Okay.

231
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:14,968
Mr. Gao.

232
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,048
What now?

233
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:18,528
I just remembered.

234
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:19,649
I forgot to grab a document.

235
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,649
Could you come with
me to the archives room?

236
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:23,288
I'll go first.

237
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,089
Join me later.

238
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:27,089
One fifty-four, one fifty-three...

239
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,929
Seems like you enjoy cleaning toilets.

240
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,208
Mr. Gao, want some water before going?

241
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:43,528
I'm not thirsty.

242
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,048
Not thirsty? Then...

243
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,409
I-I'm a bit thirsty.

244
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:47,329
I need water.

245
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:53,889
(Seriously?)

246
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:56,968
(Do you all
have to drink water right now?)

247
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:02,008
Twenty-five, twenty-four,
twenty-three...

248
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,329
(I can kiss him.)

249
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:07,448
(But how do I explain after kissing?)

250
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,208
(Will he think I'm crazy?)

251
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,129
(But I really
don't want this punishment.)

252
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:15,288
(Doomed either way.)

253
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,488
(Let's do it.)

254
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:21,248
Weren't you thirsty?

255
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:22,169
Why not drink?

256
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:25,889
Five.

257
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,329
Four.

258
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:33,488
Three.

259
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:37,208
Two.

260
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:40,488
One.

261
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:55,176
♪I woke up in a strange place♪

262
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,256
♪The sunlight here is blindingly bright♪

263
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:07,912

♪I've become the center of the story♪

265
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,809
Player, congratulations.
Random quest complete.

266
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:16,649
What's that?

267
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:18,008
I...

268
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,048
Why did she suddenly kiss him?

269
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,329
Never expected her to be so bold.

270
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:30,768
Wait, I...

271
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,528
I've lost my mind.

272
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:38,169
Let me tell you the truth.

273
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:41,048
Actually, I'm not from your world.

274
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,688
You. All of you.

275
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:47,288
Including you.

276
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:52,089
You're all just fictional characters
in a book.

277
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,968
Player attempted spoilers.

278
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,728
Time Rewind mechanism activated.

279
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,208
If triggered five times,

280
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,728
the system will automatically lock.

281
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:00,528
You'll face unknown punishment.

282
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,488
Three chances remaining.

283
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,728
Weren't you thirsty?

284
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:09,929
Why not drink?

285
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:11,768
I'm drinking. Right now.

286
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,008
Are you going to Finance?

287
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:31,968
I thought about it.

288
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,288
You can probably go alone.

289
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,488
I don't need to go with you.

290
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,569
You actually cheated with this method?

291
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:49,889
I still have three chances.

292
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,048
I'll save them for later.

293
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:54,369
Better than cleaning toilets, right?

294
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,048
Lin Huan'er,

295
00:20:58,728 --> 00:20:59,649
are you free later?

296
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:00,609
Let's go somewhere.

297
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:02,488
Sure.

298
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:25,329
So this is where you wanted to bring me?

299
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,809
Never really looked at these, have you?

300
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:35,288
Most planes here are hand-assembled
from precision mechanical parts.

301
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,849
And most are propeller-driven fighters.

302
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,208
This requires immense time and patience.

303
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:45,248
I might be boring

304
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:46,329
to have such a hobby.

305
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:54,809
I actually think
people who like these things

306
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,809
must have rich inner worlds.

307
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:02,688
These are zodiac constellations.

308
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:06,089
Why is one missing here?

309
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,048
Capricorn.

310
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:11,048
While I don't understand models,

311
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,129
I completely understand that feeling

312
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,488
of wanting
to complete a whole collection.

313
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,369
Missing just this one model

314
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,929
does feel slightly imperfect.

315
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:25,169
I used to think so too.

316
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,409
But now I believe

317
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:31,208
imperfection leaves room
for anticipation, doesn't it?

318
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:34,409
Makes sense.

319
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,416
So you brought me here today to...

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:52,565
♪Through centuries, just to meet you♪

321
00:22:52,565 --> 00:23:00,392
♪Love's time machine keeps on turning♪

322
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,288
So professional?

323
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,089
Why did you bring me here?

324
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,448
Just wanted to show you.

325
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:27,929
You said you were going
to the Finance Office today. Then...

326
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:31,329
Then I realized it wasn't essential,
so I didn't go.

327
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:34,488
What's wrong?

328
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:42,488
Nothing.

329
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:44,889
I feel like I've forgotten something.

330
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:46,208
It's good.

331
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:50,089
Let it be forgotten.

332
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:51,329
Don't push yourself.

333
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:00,768
Is this a fighter model
you just finished?

334
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:03,409
Yes. It's not painted yet.

335
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,409
No wonder
it looks so drab and colorless.

336
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,169
Care to try?

337
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:10,849
To paint it?

338
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,008
Forget it.

339
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,849
I'm afraid I might damage it.

340
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:19,409
Even if damaged, it would be unique.

341
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:24,409
Then can I paint it however I want?

342
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:25,409
Of course.

343
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:27,129
Alright.

♪Clearly, it's a fake plot♪

360
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:02,968
Truly one of a kind.

361
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,369
Why paint it this color?

362
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:13,089
Because I don't know
what color a fighter should be.

363
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:15,089
But in my mind,

364
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,569
the millennium should be this colorful

365
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:19,688
and vibrant.

366
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:25,409
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

367
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:27,089
Yes, I do.

368
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,048
Perhaps in a parallel world,
another version of me

369
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,288
has no memory of the millennium at all.

370
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:40,409
So I don't want to have any regrets.

371
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:42,329
I hope

372
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,569

Congratulations.

391
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:16,688
The male lead's fondness toward you
has reached 59%.

392
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:18,528
I'm busy.

393
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:20,288
If there's nothing urgent...

394
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:23,409
Alright.

395
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,248
Come over now.

396
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,809
I'll be at the model shop.

397
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:32,169
Are you meeting someone here?

398
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:33,929
I'll head off then.

399
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:35,528
See you at the office tomorrow.

400
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:36,929
Bye-bye.

401
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,688
You seem especially radiant today.

402
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:53,809
Do I?

403
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:56,048
I have a feeling

404
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,768
that my goal is about to be achieved.

405
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:00,048
What goal?

406
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:01,889
Secret.

407
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:05,889
I know anyway.

408
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:08,609
Isn't it just about
getting a Ph.D. for Letao?

409
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:11,288
So Letao's problem
is basically solved now, right?

410
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:13,688
You're quite well-informed.

411
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:15,609
Of course. Who do you think I am?

412
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:18,329
I heard it's a female Ph.D.

413
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:19,048
That's right.

414
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:20,569
Her name is Dazhuang.

415
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:21,208
Interesting?

416
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:25,208
That name sounds quite masculine.

417
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:30,248
She's a cool girl
with a straightforward personality.

418
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:32,048
And she's a real expert in her field.

419
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,889
Here for only a few days,

420
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:36,609
she's already solved
many of Letao's technical challenges.

421
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:37,849
She's that good?

422
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:41,609
Then why didn't she
keep working at the institute?

423
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,569
It's quite unfair.

424
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:48,768
She was supposed
to be promoted to team leader,

425
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:50,369
leading a team on projects.

426
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,288
But just because she's female,

427
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:54,809
a parachuted candidate
took the position.

428
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:58,409
Later, they had disagreements
on research approaches,

429
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:00,809
and she was forced
into an internal transfer.

430
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:02,809
I understand that feeling all too well.

431
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,329
I used to post my serial mystery comic
on a forum.

432
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,288
When they saw my profile picture
was a girl,

433
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:08,688
the comments started flooding in.

434
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:09,929
Isn't that infuriating?

435
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,448
Mengmeng, just ignore them.

436
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,048
All your dreams will come true.

437
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:14,809
Really.

438
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:19,208
Every time you say things like that,

439
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:22,369
you sound just like a prophet.

440
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,409
What do you mean, 'like'?

441
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:25,728
I am the prophet.

442
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,968
Then what's your dream?

443
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,409
My dream...

444
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:40,369
(I should be going back soon, right?)

445
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:42,129
Mengmeng,

446
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:45,248
if one day I'm gone,

447
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:46,849
will you miss me?

448
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:48,688
Where are you going?

449
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:51,089
Do you want to go abroad with Xiaojue?

450
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:54,809
You can say that.

451
00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:59,728
Then I'll wish you well.

452
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:02,849
Because no matter where you go,

453
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,569
we'll still be best friends.

454
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,688
Our hearts won't be apart.

455
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,329
You're right.

456
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:12,768
Wishing well is enough.

457
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,968
I'll wish you and Hu Tiehan well too.

458
00:31:27,248 --> 00:31:28,129
(What's going on?)

459
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:29,488
(It's broken?)

460
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:33,169
They were college classmates.

461
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,169
They started dating during college.

462
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:36,609
After graduation,

463
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,208
Ou Xiaojue went to study in the UK.

464
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,992
Lin Huan'er worked several jobs
to support him by covering

465
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:43,248
his tuition and living costs.

466
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:45,809
Later, Lin Huan'er joined Yunsheng

467
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:47,248
and secured the Letao account.

468
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:48,569
Then her life improved.

469
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:11,569
Miss Lin, do you need something?

470
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,569
I need to talk about work with Mr. Gao.

471
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:14,409
Mr. Gao is busy.

472
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,569
You can talk to me.

473
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:16,968
Let her in.

474
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:29,929
Mr. Gao, I'm here

475
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,528
to align on the women's product
marketing plan

476
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:35,528
to ensure smooth follow-up.

477
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,768
You went to great lengths
to help me recruit Dr. Wei.

478
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:41,129
You supported the R&D team

479
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,089
in adjusting the design.

480
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:44,048
You've made the marketing plan.

481
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,048
I'm grateful.

482
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:46,889
But I'm curious.

483
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,169
You're working so hard.

484
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,248
Is there some special reason behind it?

485
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:56,688
For the money?

486
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,329
(His mood shift is so abrupt.)

487
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:02,248
(Is there a bug?)

488
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,528
(Did I say something misleading?)

489
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:08,169
W-Well, not entirely for the money.

490
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,528
I also want
to see Letao succeed and grow.

491
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,369
After all, we're friends, aren't we?

492
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,008
Friends?

493
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,528
(Does he want more than friends?)

494
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:20,968
(Is he seeking a clear status?)

495
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:26,329
Well,

496
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,728
whether it's work or personal life,

497
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:30,248
I'd love to take things further.

498
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:35,208
I just feel some concepts

499
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,089
don't need to be followed so rigidly.

500
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:39,409
Personal thoughts
could be more open-minded.

501
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,008
That better fosters a relationship.

502
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,248
No need.

503
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,569
I'll read the plan.

504
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:46,169
If there's nothing else,

505
00:33:46,288 --> 00:33:46,849
please leave.

506
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:50,849
Okay.

507
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:54,288
Wait.

508
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,008
Any plans tonight?

509
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:01,208
No.

510
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,768
I have no plans after work.

511
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:04,528
I'm free.

512
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:06,889
What I mean is,

513
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,448
for your next visit,

514
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:09,689
dress the part.

515
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:10,984
For your own image.

516
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,448
Mr. Gao,

517
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,968
should we let Miss Lin coordinate
with the marketing department?

518
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,048
It's inappropriate for her
to keep coming directly to you.

519
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:41,209
Why is it inappropriate?

520
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:43,088
We're just friends.

521
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:45,568
Understood.

522
00:35:00,008 --> 00:35:01,608
(Where exactly did it go wrong?)

523
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:04,128
(His attitude
is so different from yesterday.)

524
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,168
Huan'er,

525
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:10,488
you look so nice today.

526
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:11,488
Got a date tonight?

527
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:13,968
I thought I did.

528
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:15,889
Lingling.

529
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,769
Do you think what I'm wearing today
isn't suitable for work?

530
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:23,769
It's perfectly suitable.

531
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,209
Right?

532
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,488
It's formal.

533
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,168
I meant to ask earlier, Huan'er,

534
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,608
where did you buy this outfit?

535
00:35:29,608 --> 00:35:30,488
It looks amazing.

536
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,528
I'd like to wear this for my next date.

537
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:33,528
Right?

538
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:36,369
This outfit works
for both the office and a date.

539
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:37,329
Right?

540
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:38,088
Absolutely.

541
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:40,088
Then why?

542
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,889
He told me to dress the part.

543
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,168
Am I not dressed the part enough?

544
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:48,929
Are things not going well with that guy?

545
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:49,929
Tell us about it.

546
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:51,249
We can help you figure it out.

547
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,329
Alright.

548
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:54,568
For two strangers,

549
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,929
if they want to develop
a romantic relationship,

550
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:59,209
shouldn't they start as friends?

551
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:00,689
That's normal, isn't it?

552
00:36:01,168 --> 00:36:02,729
That approach is fine.

553
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:06,968
So I suggested we be friends.

554
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:08,689
He didn't agree.

555
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:11,889
Then I said
we could take it a step further.

556
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:13,929
And he got mad.

557
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:15,008
