Hello, I was here yesterday.

13
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:57,335
I have an appointment.

No, no.

No, no.

No, no.

24
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:44,615
Mr. Gao,

25
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,096
I've tried several languages
with this lady,

26
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,296
but she didn't understand any.

27
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:54,016
Hello.

28
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,615
Miss Lin, please stop causing a scene.

29
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:59,775
You can try other companies.

30
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,735
But not at Letao, okay?

31
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:06,576
I really was sent by Yunsheng this time
to discuss cooperation.

32
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:08,215
Not interested.

33
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,215
I brought you the proposal.

34
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,735
I was scared my first time
working at heights, too.

35
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:17,376
You'll get used to it.

36
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,495
Yes, secure the safety rope later.

37
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,296
(Where there's a will,)

38
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,976
(there's a way.)

39
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:25,615
We still think

40
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:28,416
Mr. Gao's approach is more prudent.

41
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:30,895
Expanding into second

42
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,296
and third-tier cities
and large northern areas

43
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,935
is more reliable and cost-effective
than developing new products or brands.

44
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,055
Yes.

45
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,055

46
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:43,416
We're nearing fifty,
halfway to the grave.

47
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:46,655
Our thinking can't keep up
with you youngsters.

48
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:50,536
But Letao is the foundation
your father built.

49
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:53,376
It's not that we care about our shares.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,655
- Right?
- Yes.

51
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:57,576
We've watched you grow up.

52
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,735
We don't want to see Letao
ruined in your hands.

53
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:00,935
- Exactly!
- That's right.

54
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,775
It's for the company's best interests.

55
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:03,615
Yes.

Mr. Gao.

57
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,136
Why don't you say something?

58
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,055
Present a solid plan.

59
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,256
Exactly, say something.

60
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,735
We can't just let Letao...

00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:01,975

- Security!
- Security!

72
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:03,496
Get inside.

73
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:04,376
- I'll go.
- Get in.

74
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,136
It's dangerous.

75
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:06,455
I can go back the way I came.

Get in now.

77
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,295
Don't call security!

78
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,895
Miss Lin, this is Letao,

79
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:18,095
not Hollywood.

80
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:19,616
You're not Jackie Chan.

81
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:22,855
I never imagined
such a big company like Letao

82
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,176
would guard so fiercely
against a junior employee like me.

83
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:28,415
You can't set foot in here.

84
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,655
Don't waste your time.

85
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,975

Before judging something,

87
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,095
at least try to understand it.

88
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:42,455
I hope Mr. Gao
won't let our personal relationship

90
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:47,056

91
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,496
What personal relationship do we have?

92
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,455
We've eaten together,

93
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:52,655
ridden in the same car,

94
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:53,895
had physical contact,

95
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,696
and even had a financial transaction.

99
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,975
Don't rely on flashy tricks.

100
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:15,655

00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:17,975

102
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,295
if it's flashy or not.

103
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,056

This time,

146
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:57,136
we finally secured a cooperation intent
with a foreign company.

147
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:01,655
But your dad thinks
their terms are too harsh.

148
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,535
Don't you think
we should broaden our horizons?

149
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:07,815
Uncle.

150
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:11,136
Letao doesn't necessarily
need to represent foreign brands.

151
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,775
Sometimes crises bring opportunities.

152
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:14,415

00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:16,415
I know,

00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,856
you've always wanted
to develop new products.

155
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:23,055
Truth is, Letao needs
young visionaries like you.

156
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:27,856
I understand.

158
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:31,136

You've got drive.

00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:39,256
You're at your prime.

Don't worry.

165
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:49,055

those stubborn old-timers.

166

00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,336
I was worried about you.

186
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:39,895
What is it?

187
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:41,575

00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,616
Busy. I've been so busy.

191
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,616
I'm tired. Going to sleep. Bye.

192
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:49,376
Wait!

193
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:50,655
Huan'er.

194
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:52,655
I miss you so much.

195
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:54,815
(Miss me?)

196
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:57,096
(You miss my money, little gold-digger.)

197
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,616
I miss you so much.

198
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:03,616
It's been 783 days, 5 hours,
and 4 minutes since we last met.

199
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,616
Sometimes I deeply regret

200
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:07,815
going abroad for studies.

201
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,295
I shouldn't have left you alone
back there.

202
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,216
Then come back! Quit school.

203
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,376
Huan'er, you love to joke.

204
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,336
Mengmeng said
you were working multiple jobs,

205
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:25,016
yet you wouldn't even buy new clothes.

206
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:29,935
But I still shamelessly
ask you for tuition.

207
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:32,376
I'm... I'm such a fool, Huan'er.

208
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:35,016
I planned to get a job.

209
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:37,575
I really want to ease your burden.

210
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,175
But with graduation approaching,

211
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,256
I'm buried in my thesis.

212
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:42,935
No bandwidth for anything else.

213
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,935
(There is your aim.)

214
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,136
Help me one more time.

215
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,655
I'll pay you back, alright?

216
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:50,496
Sure.

217
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,216
Write me IOU notes
for all the money I sent you before.

218
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:02,935
Just kidding.

219
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:06,535
Huan'er, you're such a tease.

220
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:08,575
Not just the principal,

221
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,575
some interest at least.

222
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,695
An annual interest at 4%
is reasonable, right?

223
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:20,895
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

224
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,175
If... if you're not feeling well,

225
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,496
we can talk another day.

226
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:25,376
Don't reschedule.

227
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,055
Let's finish it.

228
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:26,935
Calls are expensive.

229
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:29,655
Wait, Huan'er,

230
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,655
why are you acting like this today?

231
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:35,336
I... Talking like this
makes us feel distant.

232
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,575
Did I do something wrong?

233
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:39,575
You're mad at me, aren't you?

234
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,935
Don't you know exactly
what you did wrong?

235
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,256
No, I don't.

236
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:46,256
If you don't know, think harder.

237
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,256
(When did he cheat again?)

238
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:53,616
Huan'er, what do you mean?

239
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,456
I'm studying so hard over here

240
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:56,935
all for our future, right?

241
00:12:57,415 --> 00:12:58,655
You're being a little immature.

242
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,295
Can't you try to understand me?

243
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:01,616
I can't put up with this.

244
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:02,456
Let's break up.

245
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,016
Fine, let's break up. Quickly.

246
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,256
Unbelievable.

247
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:17,295
Huan'er.

248
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:19,295
You've gone too far.

249
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,016
You should apologize to Xiaojue.

250
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:22,935
Why should I apologize to him?

251
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:23,775
He's a cheater.

252
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,175
He's the one at fault here.

253
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,496
Warning: Attempting to change
character's established trajectory.

254
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,415
- Wait, stop!
- Warning.

255
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:35,496
Player activated penalty.

256
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,496
Don't you rewind now.

257
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,616
I'll do better.

258
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:39,856
Really, I'm sorry.

259
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,216
I have realized my terrible mistake.

260
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:43,336
Give me a chance.

261
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,496
I'll call him right now
and win him back, okay?

262
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:47,695
It's settled then.

263
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:51,496
You...

264
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:52,175
I was wrong.

265
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,575
My attitude was awful just now.

266
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:56,456
I'll call him immediately
to make it right.

267
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:12,736
Hello?

268
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:18,216
International calls are expensive.
Need something?

269
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,856
Yes.

270
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,136
I was wrong.

271
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:24,736
My attitude earlier was terrible.

272
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,575
How could I be so awful?

273
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,216
I must've been working too much lately.

274
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,616
I haven't been in a good mood.

275
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:35,216
And my stomach hurts so badly right now.

276
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,496
What's wrong?

277
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,775
I was too busy working overtime
to have dinner.

278
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:41,575
It's fine.

279
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:42,336
Don't worry.

280
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,376
I'll just drink hot water
to feel better.

281
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,376
How could you skip dinner?

282
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:48,415
That's not right.

283
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,775
I'm working extra hours to save money.

284
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:54,055
How else can I pay for your tuition?

285
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:55,695
You're so good to me.

286
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,136
Hearing that

287
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,256
breaks my heart.

288
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:01,976
It's okay.

289
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:03,775
I brought this on myself.

290
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:06,775
No, I mean it's all my fault.

291
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,336
I'll work hard

292
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:11,016
and make money to support you.

293
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:12,415
Don't worry.

294
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,695
I won't let you down, Huan'er.

295
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:16,295
Okay, okay.

296
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,935
Take care of yourself in France, okay?

297
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:20,496
I'm in the UK.

298
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,655
Right, take care of yourself
in the UK, okay?

299
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:25,096
A little confused.

300
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,935
It's fine. How could I ever blame you?

301
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,856
I just want to fly back
to your side right now.

302
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:34,096
Just wait two more months, okay?

303
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,016
Okay, I'll wait for you.

304
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,295
Take care of yourself.

305
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,175
I'll miss you always.

306
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:50,575
What's wrong?

307
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:51,736
Static shock.

308
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:54,575
That's more like it.

309
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,336
Don't fight.

310
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:57,935
Long-distance is tough.

311
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:02,456
Mengmeng?

312
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:04,616
Thanks.

313
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,216
Bugs in the diapers?

314
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:11,376
Keep it down.

315
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,376
With such a huge scandal,

316
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:13,976
who would dare to buy this brand?

317
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,136
Beikeke probably won't make it.

318
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,456
But it might be a calculated move.
Think about it.

319
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,016
Right after making the news,

320
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,775
they immediately held a press conference

321
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,336
and experts debunked the rumors.

322
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:27,935
Isn't this cleverly disguised promotion?

323
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:29,456
Exactly.

324
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,575
Such a brilliant tactic,
truly masterful.

325
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,535

the Chairman has acted.

340
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:14,855
He used it

00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:23,535
Wait a moment.

How old is our son?

00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:27,696
He's an adult.

00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:51,896
But it's okay.

375
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,456
Once public opinion spreads,

376
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:55,615
he'll have to accept it.

377
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:03,416
Go.

378
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:13,160
(Yunsheng Tower)

379
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:15,135
Mr. Gao.

380
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:17,016
Mr. Fang.

381
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:17,696
Welcome! Welcome!

382
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,016
Please come in.

383
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,216
I'll summon her immediately.

384
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,055
Lin! Lin!

385
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:35,375
Come here, now!

386
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:37,696
You there, come here.

387
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:44,535
Lin, sit down. Have a seat.

388
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,335
So, Lin,

389
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:50,416
thanks to you,

390
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:54,416
Mr. Gao awarded our firm
the entire Letao PR project.

391
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:01,575
(You stole my plan to salvage
your brand crisis without telling me.)

392
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,575
(Now you came for cooperation.)

393
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,135
(Who knows if this is another trap)

394
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:07,976
(or fishing for my next proposal?)

395
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,416
Shocked now, aren't you?

396
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,335
I knew she couldn't handle pressure.

397
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,216
Miss Lin seems hesitant
about our collaboration.

398
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,815
Feel free to state your terms,

399
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:17,896
and we can negotiate.

400
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:20,416
No, we have no demands.

401
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,095
Mr. Gao's time is valuable.

402
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,855
Let's finalize early to speed things up.

403
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,535
Paperwork takes considerable time.

404
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:28,496
Alright, I'll take my leave.

405
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:29,456
Sure, Mr. Gao.

406
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:29,855
Goodbye.

407
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:30,335
Goodbye.

408
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,055
Twenty percent.

409
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:39,256
I want an extra twenty percent
service fee.

410
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:42,095
Wait, Mr. Gao...

411
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:42,936
No problem.

412
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:45,976
On one condition.

413
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,456
For subsequent tasks,

414
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:49,855
you must personally
work on it, Miss Lin.

415
00:20:58,615 --> 00:20:59,416
Come with me.

416
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:01,736
Well, I won't keep you.

417
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:02,936
Goodbye.

418
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,775
Goodbye, goodbye.

419
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:07,855
Oh my.

420
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:10,496
Twenty percent?

421
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,535
You even agreed to twenty percent.

422
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,656
What is this game, Mr. Gao?

423
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:33,736
I'll head down.

424
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:38,976
Miss Lin,

425
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,535
the whole process is interconnected.

426
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,216
Without your proposal to me,

427
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:45,135
there wouldn't be my generous offer

428
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:45,936
as you wished.

429
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:50,176
Of course,
if you feel it's inappropriate,

430
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,696
we don't have to do it.

431
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,815
Is this a threat?

432
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:55,456
Hardly.

433
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,295
I told you, I'm a businessperson.

434
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
I don't do worthless talks.

435
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:03,375
I just didn't expect you
to change so much.

436
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:05,976
Before yesterday,

437
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,016
I didn't expect

438
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,896
you to be someone who uses
others' proposals without permission.

439
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:15,456
It seems you have
quite a misunderstanding about me.

440
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,656
I agreed to that 20%
out of sincerity to work with you.

441
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,335
I admit

442
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:26,375
I had misunderstandings
about you before.

443
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,416
But now that we're working together,

444
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:30,976
we'll need to coordinate
frequently on work matters.

445
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:34,016
Miss Lin.

446
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:36,696
How about we formally
reintroduce ourselves?

447
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:52,575
Miss Lin.

448
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:54,496
I look forward to it.

449
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:07,896
Congratulations.

450
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,135
Male Lead's fondness
toward you is now 0.

451
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,575
Keep up the good work!

452
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:13,335
Thanks.

453
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,416
What great news.

454
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,775
I'm starting from scratch now.

455
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:20,736
Huan'er, I'm heading out.

456
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:21,575
Bye.

457
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,256
Uh, Lin,

458
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:25,496
could you take the Letao contract
to Mr. Gao for me?

459
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:26,535
Now?

460
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:28,936
Letao are probably off work by now.

461
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,855
Don't overthink unexpected windfalls.

462
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:32,775
Delays breed troubles.

463
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:35,456
So I had Finance and Legal
rush out a contract.

464
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,176
Go now.

465
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,135
Take a taxi. On the company.

466
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:41,496
Does this count as overtime for me?

467
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:42,575
Lin,

468
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:43,976
if this deal goes through,

469
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:45,375
your commission will be this much.

470
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,216
Alright, I'll go, I'll go!

471
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:49,976
There you go.

472
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:53,976
Lin Huan'er.

473
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:56,615
(Smells like trouble.)

474
00:23:57,976 --> 00:23:59,176
I want to see your boss.

475
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:06,855
Hello.

476
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,295
What's going on?

477
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,496
She probably wants you to fire me.

478
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:23,016
Yes.

479
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:29,456
So, uh, how may I address you?

480
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,535
Fuchuang.

481
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,575
Xie Wanjun.

482
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,736
You... You're the heiress
of Fuchuang Group,

483
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:50,575
Miss Xie?

484
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,055
So... what brings you here today?

485
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:58,135
(Brand Promotion Contract)
This is our branding and PR contract.

486
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,656
The contract term is ten years.

487
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,496
I wonder if your company is interested.

488
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:06,256
Yes, we're interested!

489
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:08,095
W-We are absolutely interested!

490
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:09,575
Uh,

491
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:10,496
Miss Xie,

492
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:11,696
let me confirm with you.

493
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:14,855
You mean the entire
Fuchuang International Group's

494
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:19,256
complete branding
and PR strategic contract, right?

495
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:20,535
Yes.

496
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:23,855
Fire her,

497
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,615
and the contract takes effect.

498
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:32,775
Well,

499
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:34,496
Miss Xie, the thing is,

500
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,216
Miss Lin has just joined us,

501
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:39,656
and she has little presence
in the company.

502
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:41,416
If you don't like her,

503
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,335
I can transfer her
to another department.

504
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,375
You'll never see her again.

505
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:51,135
Only the cowardly and weak
would resort to such methods.

506
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:56,335
Lin Huan'er! You...

507
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:57,736
What do you mean?

508
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,575
You're scared,

509
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,456
so you choose to run away.

510
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:03,295
Who do you think you are?

511
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,335
I'm nobody.

512
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:05,936
I'm just an ordinary employee,

513
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:08,575
who just secured a contract at Yunsheng,

514
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:10,736
which happens to be
the one Letao gave me.

515
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,575
That's all.

516
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:15,016
Believe it or not, I can go to Letao
and one word from me

517
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:16,815
will exclude you from this deal.

518
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,896
I don't believe you.

519
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,016
Where do you get that confidence?

520
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:24,416
Do you think Haiming
will always protect you?

521
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:27,456
You!

522
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,575
Fire her now! Immediately!

523
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,256
And I'll sign the contract.

524
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,896
Otherwise, you'll lose both deals.

525
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,656
Um, well, Miss Xie,

526
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:38,016
I... I really can't make this decision.

527
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,775
Mr. Gao specifically requested
Miss Lin to handle it.

528
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,575
Miss Xie.

529
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,615
You're thinking way too simply.

530
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:49,216
Even if I left Yunsheng,

531
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,335
I'd still be in Gao Haiming's life.

532
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:55,016
Aren't you just using work
as an excuse to cling to him?

533
00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:56,535
Let me tell you.

534
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:00,575
Haiming only sees this
as an amusing game.

535
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,496
He's not truly into you.

536
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:05,256
Well, if you know everything,

537
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,416
why are you so worried?

538
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,176
If I were you

539
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:10,575
and I hated someone,

540
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:12,815
I wouldn't let them off so easily.

541
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:15,016
I'd keep that person close to me,

542
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:16,295
become their client,

543
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:17,855
control them every day,

544
00:27:17,855 --> 00:27:18,696
and squeeze them dry.

545
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:23,095
But it seems you lack that courage.

546
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,055
Who says I don't dare?

547
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:26,535
Well, it doesn't matter.

548
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:27,855
I just thought about it.

549
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:30,496
I might actually be better off
without Yunsheng.

550
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:32,416
Think about it. I'm now at Yunsheng,

551
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,936
and Haiming immediately
threw a huge deal my way.

552
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:36,456
If I were unemployed,

553
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:38,855
he might just hire me directly at Letao.

554
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,176
That's perfect.

555
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:41,976
That way, I can be with Haiming all day.

556
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,656
Boss, fire me right now!

557
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:44,936
I'm going to work at Letao!

558
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:47,256
Goodbye! I'm off to see Haiming!

559
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:47,936
Lin!

560
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:48,855
Get back here!

561
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,055
Lin Huan'er, I've changed my mind.

562
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:58,216
When I hate someone,

563
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:02,896
I will slowly torment them
using every means at my disposal.

564
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:08,135
I'll sign this contract with you,

565
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:09,456
but on one condition.

566
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:10,295
What is it?

567
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:13,696
Lin Huan'er must be
the point of contact for execution.

568
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,696
Boss, you can't agree to this!

569
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:21,216
She'll torture me!

570
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,335
Do you agree or not?

571
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,976
Agree to it!

572
00:28:28,696 --> 00:28:29,575
Alright then.

573
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,496
Goodbye, Miss Xie.

574
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:49,176
Be careful on your way, Miss Xie.

575
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,855
Listen, Lin,

576
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,656
I'm lucky to have you on board.

577
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:59,016
Two massive contracts
in just one short day!

578
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,575
You're my lucky charm.

579
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:02,896
It's no big deal.

580
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:03,775
Rest assured,

581
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:05,416
I won't treat you unfairly.

582
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:07,216
Once the first payment comes in,

583
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:08,696
I'll give you a bonus immediately.

584
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:12,095
So,

585
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,055
about you and Mr. Gao...

586
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:17,656
Nonsense!

587
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:19,615
Use your brain!

588
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:21,016
If I had anything to do with him,

589
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:22,615
why would I be working here?

590
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:23,615
True.

591
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:24,095
Right?

592
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:29,135
Miss Xie is a woman in love,
grasping at shadows.

593
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:31,976
But you can't jump
to conclusions so easily.

594
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:33,095
You're right.

595
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:33,896
How shallow!

596
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,055
Yes, I am shallow.

597
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,216
Do I have it easy?

598
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:36,815
No.

599
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:37,976
Every day here,

600
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,135
I work so hard at this desk.

601
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:41,815
And now, at this hour,
I have to deliver a contract to Letao!

602
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,216
Who told you to d-deliver it
to Letao at this hour?

603
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,855
How could you do that?

604
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:48,496
You should take a taxi home
and rest right now,

605
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,095
on the company.

606
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:55,176
Uh, j-just deliver it tomorrow morning.

607
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:03,496
Fang.

608
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,335
You don't have it easy either.

609
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:06,256
It's alright.

610
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:07,135
You've worked hard.

611
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:09,335
Not at all, not at all.

612
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:11,815
Be careful on your way, Miss Lin.

613
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,808
(Letao Tower)

614
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,216
Mr. Gao's meeting is ending soon.

615
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:25,055
Just wait right here.

616
00:30:26,135 --> 00:30:26,815
Don't run off.

617
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:28,095
This isn't Hollywood.

618
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,055
(I remember the book saying)

619
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,335
(he only accepts
commissions for assembly.)

620
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,135
(Did they change the setting?)

621
00:30:54,496 --> 00:30:55,575
(He collects them, too?)

622
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:59,055
(They're limited editions
that appreciate.)

623
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:06,456
For effectively resolving the issue,

624
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,575
you get a random gift package
from the system

625
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,016
to speed things up for you.

626
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,496
Would you like to claim it?

627
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:12,496
Gift package?

628
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:13,855
Claim.

629
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:15,615
Please confirm.

630
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:16,295
Confirm.

631
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:24,911
(Glue)

632
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:26,775
What's this?

633
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:34,815
Are you crazy?

634
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:52,855
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:57,496
Let me take off my jacket.

636
00:31:57,496 --> 00:31:58,855
Hold still. It's okay.

637
00:31:59,095 --> 00:31:59,615

Miss Lin.

667
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:19,936
It's a shame
you didn't become an actress.

668
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,655
