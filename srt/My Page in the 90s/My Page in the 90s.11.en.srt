=Episode 11=

12
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,488
So you were classmates.

13
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,568
I didn't expect you two
to know each other.

14
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,688
Officer Hu is practically my savior.

15
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,167
Really?

16
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:55,967
No, he's joking.

17
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:57,327
Huan'er,

18
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,967
were you and Mr. Gao here
for dinner today?

19
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,087
We came here to discuss work.

20
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,167
What about you?

21
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,088
He asked me out to dinner.

22
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,248
So I reserved here.

23
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:13,727
Well,

24
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:14,848
we actually sat down.

25
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,688
I just remembered
we have something else.

26
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:18,288
Mr. Gao and I shouldn't disturb you.

27
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:18,808
We'll leave.

28
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:19,327
It's fine.

29
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:19,968
Wait a moment.

30
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:23,008
Old classmates getting together

31
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:23,688
is rare.

32
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:24,528
Why not catch up?

33
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,008
I'd like to hear it too.

34
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,568
What's there for us three
to catch up about?

35
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:34,568
School memories are just exams,
pressure, and things like that.

36
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,568
I won't even mention them.

37
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,368
I'm actually quite nostalgic.

38
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:40,008
You, me, Mengmeng,

39
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:41,047
- and...
- Since childhood...

40
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,688
We've been friends since childhood.

41
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:47,248
We had plenty of happy memories
back in high school.

42
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,688
I remember
we always skipped class together,

43
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:50,568
read romance novels,

44
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:52,447
climbed over walls,
passed notes, and so on.

45
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,447
Nonsense. We never did any of that.

46
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:59,248
But passing notes? You and Ou...

47
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,167
Oh, I remembered wrong.

48
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,047
Let's skip me.

49
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,688
Stop talking about me.

50
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,128
Let's talk about you and Tiehan.

51
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:13,288
I remember in high school,

52
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:15,848
didn't Tiehan... for you...

53
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,327
for you...

54
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,727
He got into a fight for me once.

55
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,128
Yes, he fought for you, right?

56
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:22,767
We were friends.

57
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:24,688
Of course I'd step up.

58
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,248
Let's eat.

59
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:35,368
So you three were a squad?

60
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:37,207
Was it just the three of you?

61
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,047
Anyone else?

62
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:38,927
There was one more.

63
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,767
And dear Mr. Gao too.

64
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,047
Mr. Gao, you are now my best friend.

65
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,288
Let me toast you.

66
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,248
I hope in the future,
in terms of work...

67
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:52,848
T-Thank you, Mr. Gao.

68
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,968
Mr. Gao, let me toast you.

69
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,727
Huan'er actually

70
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,207
works really hard.

71
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:11,767
Please be patient with her.

72
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:13,568
Allow me.

73
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:17,568
Mr. Gao.

74
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:18,928
Thank you.

75
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,847
D-Drink less.

76
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,248
No need. I'm fine.

77
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:46,488
Let me help you walk.

78
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:47,847
I'm really fine.

79
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,488
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,327
Look at you.

81
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,447
You're usually so aloof.

82
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,688
Why are you being so childish
when you're upset?

83
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:02,407
You shouldn't be so stubborn.

84
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:04,207
People might think

85
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:05,847
I'm bullying you.

86
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:10,928
It's not you bullying me.

87
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,407
I'm making it hard for myself.

88
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,128
Drunk and still talking back.

89
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,447
Then tell me.

90
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,767
How are you making it hard for yourself?

91
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:24,168
Or should I

92
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:25,568
make it hard for you instead?

93
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,087
You've been picking on me
for the past few days.

94
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:42,767
Are you jealous?

95
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,407
Gao Haiming?

96
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,048
Mr. Gao?

97
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:51,847
What?

98
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:54,608
Ignoring me?

99
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,688
Or perhaps

100
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:00,087
you like me?

101
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,128
Not at all.

102
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,447
Still denying it?

103
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:05,527
You're not being honest with yourself.

104
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:10,887
Come on, look at me.

105
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:11,847
What?

106
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:12,887
- Look at me.
- What?

107
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:13,688
Look at me.

108
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,407
Question time.

109
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,608
Choose one of these two emotions.

110
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:20,087
This one means you're jealous.

111
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:23,967
And this one means you like me.

112
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,608
Which one?

113
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:30,407
Can I not choose?

114
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:31,847
No, you must choose one.

115
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,168
Fine.

116
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:50,447
Then I choose...

117
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:53,008
I choose...

118
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:12,488
The third option.

119
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:13,767
I hate you.

120
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:16,688
You hate me?

121
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,168
How could you possibly hate me?

122
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,887
You went through all that trouble
to keep me close.

123
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,168
You're pushing it
by making me your special assistant,

124
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,608
having me come see you every day.

125
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,688
Given all the time you spend,
you clearly like me.

126
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:28,568
You can't hate me.

127
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:30,407
Why are you so talkative today?

128
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,168
Alright.

129
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,327
I'll stop talking now, lips sealed.

130
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:57,928
Alright.

131
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,207

145
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,927
You have visitors scheduled today.

146
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:42,287
To stay on schedule,
you should get up now.

This is City Voice radio.

154
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,248
We're calling to inform you

155
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:14,248
the requested song for Ms. Lin Huan'er
by you last night is selected.

156
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,328
It's for a woman I hate very much.

157
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:18,848
Her name's Lin Huan'er.

158
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,448
It'll air
during our noon broadcast today.

159
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:25,088
Well, can I cancel this song request?

160

Sorry, the schedule has been finalized.

No adjustments.

162
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,968
C-Could it air in the evening
or late night instead?

163
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:33,328
We sincerely apologize.

164
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:34,647

169
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:53,767
Mr. Gao, I'm downstairs at your place.

170
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:54,848
Got it.

171
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,968
Mr. Gao, I have news
on that matter you asked about.

172
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,968
Ou Xiaojue cheated
right after arriving in the UK.

173
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,088
What a scumbag.

174
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,848
Mr. Gao, how are you feeling?

175
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,968
When will they return to China?

176
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,047
Around 2 PM this Sunday.

177
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,567
Mr. Gao, should I arrange for Miss Lin

178
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,728
to go with me
to pick you up at the airport?

179
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,527
You're getting smarter by the day.

180
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:33,047
You taught me well, Mr. Gao.

181
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:34,448
I'm not that free.

182
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:35,287
Get out.

183
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:41,488
Hold on.

184
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,088
I recall you mentioning last time

185
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,767
that you have a friend
at Bozhou Radio and Television Station.

186
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:49,608
Is he still there?

187
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,368
H-He's still there.

188
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,287
Well, I have a friend

189
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:57,927
who got drunk last night.

190
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:04,608
So that friend of yours feels a bit shy

191
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,128
and doesn't want his confession

192
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,008
to be overheard by Lin...
or all kinds of people, right?

193
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:11,968
Just tell me if it's doable.

194
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,807
I'll give it a shot.

195
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:17,647
Consider it done.

196
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:25,608
(Mr. Gao, recovered from the hangover?)

197
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:27,128
(What's on today's agenda?)

198
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,287
(I'll pick you up at home.)

199
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,448
I'm not going to work today.

200
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,407
But you have three meetings
this afternoon.

201
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,848
You must go to work today.

202
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,527
Or I could assign Miss Lin to fieldwork

203
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,328
if you don't want to see her.

204
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,504
(Letao Tower)

205
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:55,328
Mr. Gao.

206
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:02,687
Boss,

207
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,448
over here. Morning.

208
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,848
I made some grape juice for you.

209
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:18,527
Perfect for post-hangover recovery.

210
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:20,647
No need.

211
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,848
From now on,
delegate assistant duties to Luo.

212
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:25,968
Return to your original role.

213
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:34,647
Did I do something wrong?

214
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:40,647
No, it's just... you've got
more important things to handle.

215
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:41,407
What things?

216
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:45,407
You'll see.

217
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:48,248
I have things to do.
You should get back to work.

218
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:51,887
I see.

219
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,208
You meant what you said last night.

220
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:58,328
I understand.

221
00:13:58,968 --> 00:13:59,608
Wait.

222
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,328
Which part?

223
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:04,968
Drunk words are sober thoughts.

224
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:05,767
I understand.

225
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:07,407
Hold on.

226
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,287
Which part?

227
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,407
Drink the grape juice. I'm leaving.

228
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:48,527
Put this coat on.

229
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,848
I'm fine. I don't want it.

230
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,008
Do you think I'm drunk?

231
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:54,448
No.

232
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:57,527
I just had a couple extra drinks
with that Mr. Gao.

233
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:01,167
I was just worried
he might bully Huan'er at the company.

234
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,047
Look.

235
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,887
Silly Goose, look here.

236
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:17,208
Doesn't this look like the road
from school when you walked me home?

237
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:19,647
Tell me.

238
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:24,287
Why was the school
so close to my home back then?

239
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,088
So close.

240
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:31,287
We'd arrive
before I could even finish a few jokes.

241
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,407
You...

242
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:44,208
Why did you stop walking me home later?

243
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:45,647
Why?

244
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,167
You got a car right after graduation.

245
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,088
Because of that?

246
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,527
I won't drive anymore.

247
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,407
Why was it so close?

248
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,407
Why?

249
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:32,328
Hello?

250
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,728
Miss Mengmeng, don't forget to come sign

251
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,488
the Star and Firefly contract
this afternoon.

252
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:56,527
Where to, miss?

253
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,407
Get in.

254
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:58,328
I'll charge you less.

255
00:16:58,608 --> 00:16:59,848
We can negotiate the price.

256
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,687
No thanks, I already called a cab.

257
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:03,848
I can lower the price.

258
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:04,968
What do you say?

259
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,648
Hello, I'm with Bozhou Traffic Police.

260
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,248
Your driver's license.

261
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:19,767
Okay.

262
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:21,527
Here you are.

263
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,327
Do you have a taxi permit?

264
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,807
N-No.

265
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:29,047
You know illegal ride-hailing here
is against the law, right?

266
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:30,208
Understood.

267
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:31,767
I won't do it ever again.

268
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:33,008
Go pay your fine later.

269
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:34,008
Got it.

270
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,168
Silly Goose, what are you doing here?

271
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,968
Heading somewhere?

272
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,688
The publishing house.

273
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:46,888
I'm almost late.

274
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:47,928
Could you give me a ride?

275
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:49,767
Hop on.

276
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:37,408
Thanks for today.

277
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:39,208
When my car is fixed,

278
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,367
let's go out together.

279
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,008
No problem.

280
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:43,847
Didn't you say you wouldn't drive?

281
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:47,648
Not anymore?

282
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,047
Well, maybe only occasionally
on holidays.

283
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:53,928
Bye.

284
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,728
Bye.

285
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,567
(Bozhou Jinghao Shooting Range)
Isn't this the one near my place?

286
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:18,488
Silly Goose said
not to drive on holidays.

287
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:22,047
Meaning he will be my driver?

288
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,928
(Thank you for listening
to FM98.1, dear audience.)

289
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:30,567
(Next is a song from...)

290
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:31,448
Hello, Mr. Gao.

291
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:32,728
(He requested this song)

292
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:35,008
(to express his feelings
for the one he likes.)

293
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:36,767
(He wants to tell Miss Wu,)

294
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,408
("I wish to have your heart
and grow old together.")

295
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,648
(A lot of love songs on the list today.)

296
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,208
Why listen to the radio at work?

297
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,448
Developing products needs
prior coordination with advertisers.

298
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:51,208
I'm selecting channels for research.

299
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,047
I've already shortlisted several.

300
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:53,767
No need.

301
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:55,688
Do something else.

302
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,127
Go to Dr. Wei's lab

303
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,047
and check on the materials R&D progress.

304
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:10,807
Wait.

305
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:12,767
Why me?

306
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,717
Mr. Gao, your meeting
with the production line supplier

307
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:42,047
is at 2 PM today.

308
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:45,047
Also, I've sent Lin Huan'er
to Dr. Wei's lab.

309
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,448
How will she go?

310
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:51,648
By taxi.

311
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,767
Lin Huan'er.

312
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:58,327
Lin Huan'er.

313
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:01,287
Mr. Gao?

314
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,008
(Hello, dear listeners.)

315
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:04,488
(This is FM...)

316
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:05,367
Get out first.

317
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:07,767
I have a meeting with Dr. Wei.

318
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,327
It'll be too late if I don't go soon.

319
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:11,928
I'll drive you.

320
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,928
Is there a problem
with the materials R&D?

321
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,527
Does it require you to go personally?

322
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:32,047
Where's the radio switch?

323
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:32,688
It's broken.

324
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:34,928
It's broken?

325
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,208
I wanted to listen to City Voice.

326
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,208
That program is really well done.

327
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:42,408
It suits our product's vibe perfectly.

328
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:43,928
My research isn't finished yet.

329
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,047
Now it's broken.

330
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:45,928
Not necessary.

331
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,208
Why are you acting so strange today?

332
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:54,928
Am I?

333
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:56,208
You are.

334
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:03,008
This isn't the way to the lab.

335
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:07,287
I'm taking you to relax

336
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,047
and get inspired.

337
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:16,047
So... all this
was just to take me on a date?

338
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,688
Consider it working from elsewhere.

339
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:29,208
Then can I choose somewhere
comfortable and inspiring to work?

340
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,168
Like where?

341
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:34,208
Coastal Park.

342
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:37,287
The seaside?

343
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:40,888
Mengmeng mentioned
there's a market there.

344
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,127
I want to check it out.

345
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:49,488
Alright.

346
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:50,807
To the seaside.

347
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:59,968
The sea. I want to see the sea.

348
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,087
The estuary counts as the sea?

349
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,527
Yes, it does. Pull over up front.

350
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:22,488
Sea, here I come.

351
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:38,408
What are you doing? Come over.

352
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,408
(Mom! Mom!)

353
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:50,527
What? Is the suit inconvenient
for sea viewing?

354
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,248
Mr. Gao, I've heard

355
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:58,488
wishes made to the sea work well.

356
00:23:58,847 --> 00:23:59,807
Won't you try?

357
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,327
Let's go.

358
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,047
Let's go look.

359
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,208
Don't you have any wishes?

360
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:13,527
Make wishes here.

361
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:23,888
(Mom! Mom, help!)

362
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,208
Oh great sea,

363
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:27,928
please let me go back.

364
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:31,127
I really miss home.

365
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:40,448
Let me go back soon. I'm begging you.

366
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:42,527
Thank you. Thank you.

367
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:44,807
Are you done?

368
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,208
Are you cold?

369
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:49,688
No.

370
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:55,008
You're afraid of water?

371
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,168
Stop looking. Let's go.

372
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,104
Are you afraid of water
because you can't swim?

373
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:39,208
Did you drown as a kid?

374
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:42,168
Why do you want
to know so much about me?

375
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,168
It's better to know both sides.

376
00:25:44,408 --> 00:25:47,928
To cooperate better
at work in the future,

377
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:49,208
I need to lay the groundwork.

378
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:53,168
Feeling better now?

379
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:56,168
I thought you were going to talk work
with that sour face forever?

380
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:03,336
I'm not talking work with you.

381
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,607
Are we talking about feelings then?

382
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,008
Sure.

383
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:13,567
Answer me.

384
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:17,047
Who are you working
so tirelessly and persistently for?

385
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,008
For money.

386
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:39,168
What is it?

387
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,367
Got it.

388
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:48,968
I'll be back soon.

389
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:51,008
What's wrong?

390
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:53,488
Nothing.

391
00:26:54,168 --> 00:26:56,888
Just a problem with the equipment
on the production line.

392
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:59,968
The supplier we had a deal with
just backed out.

393
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,127
Fuchuang's doing again?

394
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:05,168
Not sure yet.

395
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:06,767
But if the equipment fails,

396
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,408
the whole production line will halt.

397
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,168
And the raw materials we ordered
for after New Year will pile up.

398
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,127
Is there a contingency plan?

399
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,688
We have backups
in Switzerland and Italy.

400
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,287
But we still need a final screening.

401
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:23,567
(Italy?)

402
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:24,728
(Right.)

403
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:27,047
(He'll bring back 33 cans of air
from Italy.)

404
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,488
(A turning point in his relationship
with Lin Huan'er.)

405
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:30,607
No need to compare.

406
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,767
Choose the Italian one.

407
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,408
But the Italian one costs 3% more
than the current one.

408
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:41,807
Even if we can secure it,

409
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,208
the profit margin will be very low.

410
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:44,607
Forget about the board.

411
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:45,928
I won't even get past my dad.

412
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:48,087
Don't worry about that for now.

413
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,208
Secure it first.

414
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:51,567
Although this one
has higher upfront costs,

415
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:53,888
it's beneficial
for long-term development later.

416
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:54,928
Trust me.

417
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:59,127
Another prophecy?

418
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:02,648
No, this time it's fate's choice.

419
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,567
Mr. Gao, do you believe in fate?

420
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:45,567
I think your trip to Italy this time
is fated.

421
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:48,208
Boss,

422
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,047
your flights and hotel
have been arranged.

423
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:50,648
All the best.

424
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:51,648
We'll be waiting for you.

425
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,248
Safe travels.

426
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:54,648
Bye.

427
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:48,287
(He should be returning today.)

428
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:54,888
Slow down. Tell me what's wrong.

429
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:57,567
Okay, I'll call now.

430
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:00,807
We don't have specific details yet.

431
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:02,408
The plane has lost contact.

432
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:04,567
I heard it's been out of contact
for over two hours.

433
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,168
The airline is urgently searching
for the plane's signal.

434
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:08,408
Was there an accident?

435
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:09,408
Hard to tell.

436
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,047
Crashes often start with lost contact.

437
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:11,688
And then...

438
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:13,767
Don't jinx it, alright?

439
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:14,408
Exactly.

440
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:17,807
Luo.

441
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:19,968
We'll talk later.

442
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:21,408
What exactly happened?

443
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:25,888
Mr. Gao's return flight from Italy today
has been out of contact.

444
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:33,047
Sorry.

445
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:35,968
The number you dialed
cannot be reached for the moment.

446
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:44,408
Sorry.

447
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,168
The number you dialed
cannot be reached for the moment.

448
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,047
The chairman has used connections
to reach the airline.

449
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:53,968
We'll be notified immediately
once there's news.

450
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,648
(The system gave me no alert.)

451
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,767
(He's definitely safe.)

452
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,087
(No way he's in danger.)

453
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:04,168
(He's the male lead.)

454
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:05,327
(He can't be written off.)

455
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:06,607
Luo,

456
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:08,567
there's an issue
with the production line now.

457
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:10,408
We can't reach the supplier.

458
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:14,807
I'm sure
nothing has happened to Mr. Gao.

459
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:16,688
Everyone, stay calm.

460
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:19,688
Let's not panic before we get results.

461
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:20,968
Proceed as normal for now.

462
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:23,287
Yes. Everyone, return to work.

463
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:25,168
I'll go to the airport.
Call me if needed.

464
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:26,168
I'll go with you.

465
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,767
Luo, what's the situation on your end?

466
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:40,168
The airport says
the flight is still missing.

467
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,408
What about your side?

468
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,448
The airline wants us
to keep waiting for now.

469
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:44,688
They're still verifying.

470
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:46,327
It's okay. Let's not lose hope yet.

471
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:47,448
Let's wait for now.

472
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,287
Then we'll split up and ask around.

473
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,168
Okay.

474
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:10,168
(You're the male lead.
You'll definitely be fine.)

475
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:16,448
Lin Huan'er.

Nothing.

502
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:45,567
This is for you.

503
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:47,928

504
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,087
Don't open it yet.
