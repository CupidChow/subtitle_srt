=Episode 2=

12
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:49,296
Sorry for the wait.

13
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:56,736
You... You're that 'costs extra' guy?

14
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:57,977
Miss Zhu Mengmeng?

15
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,456
How could it be you?

16
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,456
It's unexpected. I'm surprised.

17
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:08,737
Mr. Gao, the dishes
are ready to be served.

18
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:09,696
Okay.

19
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,217
Miss Zhu Mengmeng,

20
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:20,416
although I already know your name,

21
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,816
shouldn't we formally
introduce ourselves?

22
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:24,416
I don't think that's necessary.

23
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:26,976
This blind date
was forced on me by my family.

24
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,217
I didn't want to come.

25
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:30,057
And you...

26
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,057
You're not getting younger.

27
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,096
And your family's pushing.

28
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:37,256
But me, I've always thought

29
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,057
we should enjoy life while young.

30
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,017
Right?

31
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,777
What a real shame, though.

32
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,856
You look all proper and respectable
on the surface,

33
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:56,057
but secretly, you're quite the player.

34
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,656
I'm meeting my ex for clubbing tonight.

35
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:02,376
Want to join us?

36
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,536
No thanks. I have plans later.

37
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,217
Seriously?

38
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,457
Young people should have fun.

39
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:10,937
Don't tell me you...

40
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:17,937
I see.

41
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:20,617
Have an oyster.

42
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:22,696
Thanks.

43
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,576
(Seriously? Not even mad?)

44
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:35,376
What?

45
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:37,017
This is how I relax.

46
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:38,576
You don't mind, do you?

47
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,057
Suit yourself.

48
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:56,057
Look at that handsome little face
of yours.

49
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:59,897
Your body is pretty hot too.

50
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:03,096
If I could just have a casual fling
with you,

51
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,416
I wouldn't mind that at all.

52
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,897
Too bad we're not really a match.

53
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,337
I disagree.

54
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,256
I think we're quite a match.

55
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:14,457
Calm versus lively. Opposites attract.

56
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:17,737
Is that so?

57
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:22,297
But there's something
I think I should tell you upfront.

58
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:25,376
I'm pregnant. Eight weeks.

59
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:26,417
The due date is next year.

60
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,537
I'm guessing you mind?

61
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:29,737
Of course not.

62
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,937
You may not know much about my family.

63
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,136
Before I marry and have kids,

64
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:36,488
my father won't feel secure
giving me the family business.

65
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,256
After we marry,
I can inherit the family fortune.

66
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,297
And you won't have to
worry about gossip.

67
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,256
We truly are a match made in heaven.

68
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:48,336
I see.

69
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,216
You've just taken a fancy to me.

70
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:52,537
But listen to me.

71
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,497
Someone like you...

72
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,937
is actually pretty surprising.

73
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:01,136
Alright.

74
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:03,057
I'm off to go clubbing with my exes.

75
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,977
But thanks again for the meal.

76
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:12,216
Hello? Yes.
This is Gao Haiming from Letao.

77
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,896
We need quicker emergency responses.

78
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,776
If your company can't manage that,

79
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,896
then I may turn to someone else.

80
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,696
Good. I'll await your proposal.

81
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:36,896
Anything else?

82
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,216
I'm not full.

83
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:41,776
Then take your time.

84
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:42,816
I've paid the bill.

85
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:43,776
Need to go. Bye.

86
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,136
Wait, Gao Haiming.

87
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:48,617
Gao Haiming! Hold on a second.

88
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:50,984
Is there something else,
Miss Zhu Mengmeng?

89
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,000
I think I need to explain something.

90
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,576
I'm not a club-goer.

91
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:57,737
I don't have that many exes.

92
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:58,937
I've never even dated anyone.

93
00:05:58,937 --> 00:05:59,857
I'm very loyal.

94
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:01,136
I don't go clubbing at night.

95
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:02,136
And I'm not pregnant.

96
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:03,696
Why tell me this?

97
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:06,617
You might not believe this,

98
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,937
but I suddenly realized
you're a great person.

99
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,376
You're a gentleman, compassionate,

100
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:13,336
tolerant,

101
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:14,456
and very polite.

102
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,776
So I think we should start over.

103
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,657
I'm not Zhu Mengmeng. I'm Lin Huan...

104
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:19,097
No need.

105
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,896
I know you're not Miss Zhu Mengmeng.

106
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:22,696
I've met her

107
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:23,857
on other occasions.

108
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,057
I just didn't say hello.

109
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:25,896
But I'm certain

110
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,336
Zhu Mengmeng
definitely doesn't have your face.

111
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:36,057
I don't know why
you're impersonating Miss Zhu Mengmeng,

112
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,497
but someone like you...

113
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,696
is pretty surprising.

114
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:51,537
Seriously? This is...

115
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,297
Male Lead's fondness toward you: -50%.

116
00:06:58,657 --> 00:06:59,537
A hellish start.

117
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,136
Player, you need to try harder.

118
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,816
W-What kind of lousy system are you?

119
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:06,776
What a lousy system!
Couldn't you hint when the boss arrived?

120
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:07,977
A 'beep' would've helped.

121
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:09,928
You misled me into making a mistake.

122
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,136
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

123
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,057
Stay calm, Lin Huan'er.

124
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,417
Your goal is to leave this book.

125
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,057
Keep it up.

126
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:21,937
You can do it.

127
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:23,576
Get out of here.

128
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:25,336
Do not damage the system.

129
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,097
Mr. Gao,

130
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,896
today's blind date
took 40 minutes in total.

131
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:34,857
A new record.

132
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:41,977
Know what to say if the chairman asks?

133
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:43,696
I know. Don't worry.

134
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,136
Been with you this long.

135
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,537
The chairman is just concerned.

136
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,376
Regarding some products'
declining reputation,

137
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,177
we've replaced the relevant partners.

138
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,816
Four companies
have shown interest in collaborating.

139
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,177
No need to rush.

140
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:10,097
Good companies stand out
through fierce competition.

141
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:11,177
Okay.

142
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:19,977
Miss Lin.

143
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,256
Mr. Gao, hello.

144
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:46,336
Are you okay?

145
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:47,576
I'm fine.

146
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,017
Miss, are you okay?

147
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:58,576
I'm fine.

148
00:08:58,576 --> 00:08:59,257
Miss?

149
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:01,417
Who are you?

150
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,017
Move aside.

151
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:06,856
Mr. Gao, long time...

152
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,616
What a coincidence. We meet again.

153
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,257
Move your car, please.

154
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,216
You're blocking my car.

155
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:25,216
Is it your car?

156
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:26,456
I don't know.

157
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:28,057
My car just broke down,

158
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,417
so I stopped here to fix it.

159
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,297
Boss,

160
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,336
she's clearly targeting you.

161
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:35,297
No.

162
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,017
You have a deep misunderstanding of me.

163
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,937
I think we need to start over.

164
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:42,696
Need me to call a tow truck?

165
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,137
No need, I'll drive away now.

166
00:09:57,177 --> 00:09:58,177
My car

167
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,456
may not be fixed anytime soon.

168
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:02,657
How about this?
I'll call someone to come fix it,

169
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:05,496
and in the meantime,
we can grab some coffee

170
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:06,096
and talk.

171
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:37,576
Feels much better, right?

172
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:44,976
The steering wheel-to-seat distance
and seat height don't suit you.

173
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,456
It's not your car, right?

174
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:07,736
Miss Lin,

175
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,137
here's some advice.

176
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,137
Direction outweighs effort.

177
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:12,696
If the direction is wrong,

178
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:14,177
no amount of effort will matter.

179
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:23,576
Who do you think you are?

180
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:34,137
Male Lead's fondness toward you: -80%,

181
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,816
and it continues to drop.

182
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,177
Darn fictional character.

183
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:47,856
She silently devoted seven years
to her boyfriend.

184
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:50,777
And now she calls me a lovesick fool?

185
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,856
Sometimes I really wonder

186
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,696
if there's another person
living inside her body.

187
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,177
It's a very good story.

188
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,897
I'm curious about her.

189
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:09,257
Life always has its sudden surprises.

190
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:12,137
Like her suddenly changed personality

191
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:15,177
or some unexpected encounters.

192
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:19,096
Sir,

193
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,976
do you think that in a dimension
higher than ours,

194
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:25,057
there exists a 'Hand of God,'

195
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:28,657
and our fates were arranged long ago?

196
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:34,017
Miss Mengmeng,

197
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,937
I must say
your imagination is truly rich.

198
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,417
But what I want to draw more
is the story of these two girls.

199
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,297
As for the grand subject of fate,
let's leave that to fate itself.

200
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,137
A story
with a touch of fantasy like this

201
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:54,696
is actually very novel.

202
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,777
I think the topic
should get past the editors.

203
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,257
Besides, with the popularity
of Star and Firefly,

204
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:03,017
readers will expect this one even more.

205
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,017
In that case,

206
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,336
will you start
after Star and Firefly finishes?

207
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:06,937
No.

208
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:08,537
I can start right now.

209
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:10,017
I'm brimming with inspiration.

210
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,017
Now?

211
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:12,736
Yeah, take a look.

212
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,057
(Her, Out of Nowhere)
The storyline

213
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:15,017
and thematic style.

214
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,976
There's character design too.

215
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,335
(Comic Project Proposal)

216
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,937
Not bad, Miss Mengmeng.

217
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,816
Seems you came prepared.

218
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:27,057
Alright then.

219
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,177
I'll review this in the coming days.

220
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,856
(Create a romance.)

221
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:38,816
(Use your feminine charm)

222
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,937
(to show your best visual effect.)

223
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:46,377
(Or use some props
to achieve this goal.)

224
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,057
(Like a fluffy pet.)

225
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:53,377
Mr. Gao.

226
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,096
What a coincidence meeting you here.

227
00:13:59,177 --> 00:13:59,976
Don't get me wrong.

228
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:03,576
I saw an extremely adorable little bunny
by the roadside.

229
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:05,976
I couldn't help but pick it up.

230
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:08,017
Look, isn't it cute?

231
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:11,137
Pet it.

232
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:11,976
Stay away from me.

233
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:13,736
I'm allergic to animal hair.

234
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,177
Allergic?

235
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,336
(I knew I couldn't trust that woman.)

236
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:21,537
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:24,537
I have tissues. Here.

238
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:25,257
No, thanks.

239
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:26,816
Hi, Player.

240
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,336
Since you're new to this world,

241
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:30,177
we're distributing
an exclusive item now.

242
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:31,336
Please use it wisely.

243
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:32,856
Wipe off.

244
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:43,657
Wait.

245
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,576
W-What's happening?

246
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:48,696
Wait. This... I-I...

247
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:53,057
Miss Lin,

248
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,537
I hope we don't meet again.

249
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:07,616
Wait. How am I supposed to explain this?

250
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:11,616
Congratulations.

251
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,177
After your series of efforts,

252
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,336
Male Lead's fondness toward you

253
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,377
has finally dropped to -100%.

254
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,897
Negative 100%? That's insane.

255
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,696
Although the fondness keeps dropping,

256
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,377
this has triggered
the system's punishment quest.

257
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:24,937
Punishment?

258
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:26,096
You're punishing me?

259
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:27,576
Why should I accept any punishment?

260
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:34,537
Pull over up ahead.

261
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:36,616
What is it, boss?

262
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,496
That sanitary pad earlier
was really gentle on the skin.

263
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:42,377
Pretty soft.

264
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,816
What brand was it?

265
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:47,897
Find a supermarket.

266
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:49,976
Got it.

267
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:05,537
Look.

268
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:11,096
So handsome.

269
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:12,336
Let's take a look.

270
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:13,297
Let's go.

271
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:25,377
A man taking so many sanitary pads?

272
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:26,816
How odd.

273
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:29,960
(Flex Fit, Silky Soft)

274
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:44,897
Dear Player,

275
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:45,976
accept your punishment

276
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,456
and begin your performance.

277
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,496
What does that mean?

278
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:51,856
You want me to clean the toilets?

279
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:53,736
Make sure they're spotless.

280
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:55,937
Are you kidding me?

281
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:02,777
Wait. Didn't you tell me
to win over Gao Haiming?

282
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:03,696
Just let me out now.

283
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:05,056
I'll win him over today.

284
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,817
You must accept
the system's punishment first.

285
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:10,296
What will you do if I refuse?

286
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,256
Then you must clean
all the building's toilets.

287
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,937
In your dreams!

288
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,536
Congratulations.

289
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,736
Your punishment is over.

290
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:36,016
You may now resume the main quest.

291
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,536
You evil, lousy system!

292
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,817
What's the point of punishing me?

293
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:47,256
It's to make you understand

294
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,137
slacking off comes with a price.

295
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,536
When have I ever slacked off?

296
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,976
I've been working very hard!

297
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:54,577
Then you're not trying hard enough.

298
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:57,657
Since your Love at First Sight quest
has failed,

299
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,417
let's settle for the next best option.

300
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:03,296
Now complete the quest of establishing
a work connection with Gao Haiming.

301
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,177
Meaning?

302
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,177
So you're saying
I have to go work at Letao now?

303
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:17,448
(Letao Tower)

304
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:23,016
Board members,

305
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:26,137
this year, the market share
of the Lovebaby diapers we represent

306
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,296
firmly holds the top spot,

307
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:28,817
but compared to last year,

308
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:31,216
our growth trend
has decreased by eight percent.

309
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:32,657
In summary,

310
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:34,016
for the first half of 1999,

311
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,296
(Product Competitiveness Analysis)
Letao product profit growth is slowing,

312
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:37,657
with profits declining.

313
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,016
Board members,

314
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:45,536
Letao's current situation
is not optimistic.

315
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,736
So, we're having this meeting today

316
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:51,256
also to hear any good suggestions
you board members might have.

317
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:53,776
I believe we should expand
the scope of our advertising.

318
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:55,256
I think

319
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,937
we should make some adjustments
to our sales strategy.

320
00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:02,256
I think we should partner more
with large companies like Fuchuang

321
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:04,097
to jointly develop the market.

322
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:07,056
Haiming,

323
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:08,736
what do you think?

324
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,256
If we want to break through,

325
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,817
we must end conventional thinking.

326
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:16,817
I believe we should develop
our own products

327
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:20,016
and set up production lines,
especially for feminine hygiene.

328
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,937
Only then can we comprehensively
overcome the current bottleneck.

329
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:26,177
We haven't even done market research.

330
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:27,056
Exactly.

331
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,256
We also lack production experience.

332
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:34,137
Luo, distribute the materials.

333
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,800
(Proposal
for Self-Developed Sanitary Pads)

334
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:40,296
Please read the materials.

335
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:41,617
(Market Background & Demand Analysis)
They analyze

336
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:44,177
similarities and differences
between sanitary pads and diapers.

337
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:47,056
They're very similar
in manufacturing process and materials.

338
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:47,859
(Proposal
for Self-Developed Sanitary Pads)

339
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:49,056
These are

340
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,296
(Sanitary Pad Skin Friction Test)
nine common sanitary pads on the market,

341
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:54,377
showing skin redness
after a 100-rub friction test.

342
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,696
You can see the results directly.

343
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:57,657
As for the Lovebaby brand...

344
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,897
Mr. Gao, your wrist?

345
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:02,216
It's fine.

346
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,617
But have you considered

347
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:11,736
the time cost, labor cost,
and financial cost required?

348
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,337
The risk is extremely high.

349
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,536
If it succeeds, it's fine.

350
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:16,577
But if it fails,

351
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:19,577
how am I supposed
to justify that to the board?

352
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:22,177
So let's table this matter
for later discussion.

353
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:24,617
That's all for today. Meeting adjourned.

354
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,256
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

355
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,417
Haiming,

356
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:34,857
stay.

357
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,256
I need to talk to you.

358
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:39,657
Mr. Gao,

359
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,216
the interviews need you.

360
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:42,696
Chairman,

361
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,097
I have interviews.

362
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:44,976
We'll talk later.

363
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:54,056
(Proposal
for Self-Developed Sanitary Pads)

364
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,976
Developing sanitary pads?

365
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,617
Not doing proper work all day.

366
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:00,056
No idea what's on his mind.

367
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:04,456
Look.

368
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:05,857
I think it looks fine.

369
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,496
Just write it like you have it.

370
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,137
I think that should be enough.

371
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:16,657
I think it's enough.

372
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:19,337
Actually,

373
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:21,097
seeing so many people makes me nervous.

374
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:22,776
Have we started?

375
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:23,256
Almost.

376
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:26,137
Put all the interviewee resumes
in Mr. Gao's office later.

377
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:26,536
Okay.

378
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,496
Hand all your resumes to me now.

379
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:31,696
- Excuse me.
- Mine.

380
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:32,377
Excuse me.

381
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,097
When is my turn?

382
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:35,377
In order, you're the last one.

383
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:41,496
Do you have scissors?

384
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:42,216
May I borrow them?

385
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,176
(Resume)

386
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:52,296
Lin Huan'er?

387
00:21:56,937 --> 00:21:58,976
So I think we need to start over.

388
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:00,657
I'd like to introduce myself to you.

389
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:01,256
- No need.
- I...

390
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,937
I know you're not Miss Zhu Mengmeng.

391
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,456
Your misunderstanding of me
is far too deep.

392
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,056
I think we need to start over.

393
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,216
Mr. Gao.

394
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,177
What a coincidence. We meet again.

395
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:26,216
Cutting in line.

396
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,296
All forms were the same size.

397
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:36,016
Why is this smaller when submitted?

398
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:37,776
The form's been cut down.

399
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:39,216
It slips out when organizing.

400
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,177
So it's easily placed on top.

401
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:43,097
Lin Huan'er is absolutely relentless.

402
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:44,817
I'll kick her out right away.

403
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:45,496
Wait.

404
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,976
- Where are you going?
- To interview them.

405
00:23:04,857 --> 00:23:05,897
Hello, I'm Lin Huan'er.

406
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:08,617
I'm applying
for the position of GM's assistant.

407
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:18,296
We are not hiring a GM's assistant.

408
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:21,016
I believe Mr. Gao needs one.

409
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:30,097
What qualities do you think
this role should possess?

410
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:32,056
And what qualities do you possess?

411
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:37,657
Patience, meticulousness,
and responsibility. I possess them all.

412
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:39,976
But most importantly,

413
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:43,177
I know your general manager inside out.

414
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,256
Miss Lin,

415
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:03,617
you're smart.

416
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,976
But it isn't enough
for you to be my assistant.

417
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:13,137
No wonder you're the boss.

418
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:17,617
Even my smallest thoughts
can't escape your notice.

419
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,496
Flattery?

420
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,617
Just a tiny bit of rainbow flattery.

421
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,417
Doesn't it sound acceptable?

422
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:28,216
Rainbow flattery?

423
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:38,296
Actually, I have many ideas for Letao.

424
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:40,056
Go ahead.

425
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:44,496
First, I believe Letao
shouldn't confine itself to agency work.

426
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:46,817
We need our own production line.

427
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:48,097
I believe

428
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:52,256
you aim to build it
into a unicorn company in the future.

429
00:24:53,177 --> 00:24:53,817
Unicorn?

430
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:55,456
Second,

431
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,137
we should focus on user experience.

432
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,296
We must seek new directions,

433
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:01,976
identify pain points,

434
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:02,736
provide solutions,

435
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,976
and deliver exceptional
user experiences.

436
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:07,496
Finally,

437
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:11,337
the future belongs to AI and big data.

438
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,976
The era of online shopping
is approaching.

439
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:17,016
We must be ready for an intelligent,
automated, and interconnected future

440
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:18,817
and embrace the internet.

441
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:24,137
- What's she saying?
- No idea.

442
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:24,968
I can't understand.

443
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:27,056
That's all.

444
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:28,857
Miss Lin,

445
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:31,417
you applied to be the GM's assistant.

446
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:32,937
Your job is

447
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:34,177
to aid the general manager

448
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:35,016
and serve him.

449
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,177
Only one person
can judge your competence.

450
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:40,137
You.

451
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:45,137
I regret to say
you didn't pass the interview.

452
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,016
Mr. Gao.

453
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:56,256
Miss Lin, turn right after exiting
for the elevator.

454
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:08,216
She won't leave.

455
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:10,657
You're so sure?

456
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:13,097
After all that effort,

457
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:15,256
she won't give up easily.

458
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,696
Male Lead's fondness toward you
has increased,

459
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:35,817
currently at -80%.

460
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:38,617
But you still haven't secured
a position at Letao.

461
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,177
Current quest continues.

462
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:43,897
Find every way to establish work ties
with Gao Haiming.

463
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:52,840
(Resume)

464
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:05,216
(Even at -80%,)

465
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,776
(but no one knows the ending)

466
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,216
(until the last page is turned.)

467
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:20,097
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:25,137
I know my recent actions
have been confusing.

469
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:27,736
So let me explain.

470
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:32,526
I have unavoidable reasons.

471
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,417
That's why I'm trying so hard
to change your bad impression of me.

472
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:40,016
Is starting low and ending high
also your strategy?

473
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,056
I wonder if you've experienced this.

474
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:45,496
Being stranded alone
in unfamiliar territory,

475
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:47,536
everything around you feels alien.

476
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:50,256
So you desperately seek an exit.

477
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:53,097
The exit you mentioned

478
00:27:53,617 --> 00:27:56,857
means finding someone
like me or Mr. Lu, right?

479
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:00,976
I know you don't trust anything I say.

480
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,817
But I'm asking for one more chance.

481
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,016
Let me stay at Letao.

482
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,857
Who told you I frequent the model shop?

483
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,456
Who's helping you know me?

484
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,696
Our meeting at that shop
was no coincidence.

485
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:30,577
If I could give spoilers,

486
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:32,097
I'd have explained everything.

487
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,337
But the point is, I can't say anything.

488
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:35,976
Regardless,

489
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:37,617
please believe I mean no harm.

490
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:40,337
I hope you'll accept my apology.

491
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,240
Sorry for the trouble.

492
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:44,696
Wait.

493
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:58,897
What brand was the pad
you gave me last time?

494
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:02,617
Just a survey.

495
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:05,456
Sure.

496
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:06,377
Let me find you one.

497
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:17,496
I'm out.

498
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:20,897
Do you have any pads then?

499
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:21,577
Give me one.

500
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:26,056
Never mind. I'm leaving.

501
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:32,496
Review this proposal.

502
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,937
Revise this section.

503
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:34,857
Excuse me.

504
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:36,536
Do you have any sanitary pads?

505
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:37,456
Could you spare one?

506
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:43,817
It's the new millennium.

507
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:44,937
Why the period shame?

508
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:50,016
Excuse me.
Do you have any sanitary pads?

509
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:11,976
Thank you.

510
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:26,296
What's happening?

511
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:26,897
No idea.

512
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:27,536
She left.

513
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:28,377
Did you see that?

514
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,024
Mr. Gao gave her sanitary pads.

515
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:30,976
Mr. Gao and...

516
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,417
Male Lead's fondness toward you
has increased

517
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:46,657
and is currently at -50%.

518
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:09,696
What is it?

519
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:12,536
Still upset about
not passing Letao's interview?

520
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:14,696
You know nothing.

521
00:31:16,296 --> 00:31:16,976
It's fine.

522
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:19,056
If you can't get into Letao,

523
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,177
you can attend its owner's banquet

524
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:24,016
and meet this weird man
selling sanitary pads.

525
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,617
(Letao Banquet & Celebration
of Founder's Pearl Wedding Anniversary)

526
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:32,456
7:00 PM?

527
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,216
We're running late, Mengmeng.

528
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:57,846
(30th Pearl Wedding Anniversary)

529
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,216
Thank you, everyone.

530
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:13,617
Our partners and dear friends,

531
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:17,776
thank you for being here to celebrate
our Pearl Wedding Anniversary with us.

532
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:23,056
My wife and I have walked hand in hand
for thirty years.

533
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:25,456
My love for her

534
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:31,417
goes beyond my instant infatuation
when we first met.

535
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:36,177
It also goes beyond her giving me
such a wonderful son

536
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:39,216
and building our warm, happy family.

537
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:44,296
So, on this special commemorative day,

538
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:48,177
I've prepared a unique gift for my wife.

539
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,456
Let me show you.

540
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,577
It holds special meaning.

541
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:01,177
For thirty years of marriage,

542
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:06,337
I've selected thirty precious pearls,

543
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:07,456
strung together.

544
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:09,417
I present this to my wife.

545
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,776
May her future journey

546
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:34,256
shine like this pearl necklace,

547
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:37,577
radiant and luminous forever.
