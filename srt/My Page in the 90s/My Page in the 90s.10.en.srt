Hey, man. Why'd you stop shooting?

Since you're here,

32

Hey, don't rush off.

Really, no need.

37
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,744
So you've got the guts to fine us,

38
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,224
but you're too chicken to compete?

39
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,464
Are you chickening out?

40
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:19,344
Chicken!

00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:22,865

00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,184
I'll pay for you.

00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:28,464

00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,385
Let's play next time.

47
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:35,464
Talk to me.

48
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,185
What's bothering you?

You're not yourself today.

51
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:52,304
Some things just can't be controlled,
no matter how hard you try.

52
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:54,185
Just like shooting.

53
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:56,424
Even if you aim, you might miss.

54
00:04:58,745 --> 00:04:59,585
Business troubles?

55
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,424
I don't understand business,

56
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:12,265
but it feels a lot
like relationships sometimes.

57
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:16,664
You chase someone forever,
only to end up empty-handed.

58
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:24,344
So if something isn't meant for you,

59
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:25,904
would you let it go?

60
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,464
Yes. If I knew it was impossible,

61
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,104
and it was best for them,

62
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:42,544
I would.

63
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:44,464
You wouldn't shoot even it's targeted?

64
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:47,864
What's wrong with you today?

65
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,145
You're not like me.

66
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:53,585
What could you want that you can't have?

67
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:03,745
Is there someone you can't let go of?

68
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:10,784
One more round.

69
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,784
- To Xiaojue's smooth studies.
- To Xiaojue's smooth studies.

70
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:59,104
Don't go changing your heart
once you're in England.

71
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:02,104
Or I'll fly straight there
and hunt you down.

72
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:05,145
Xiaojue,

73
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,385
Mengmeng must have been just joking.

74
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,945
We all know you'd never change.

75
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:16,745
But after you go to England,

76
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,145
you have to write to me.

77
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:22,025
Okay. And you have
to take good care of yourself too.

78
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,265
Don't worry.

79
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:26,104
I'll miss you so much over there.

80
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:27,145
And I'll worry about you.

81
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:32,065
Tiehan, Mengmeng.

82
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:34,185
We're all classmates.

83
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:35,705
After I go abroad,

84
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:39,505
I leave Huan'er in your care.

85
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:40,945
Don't worry.

86
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:42,745
It's okay.

87
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,745
I can take care of myself.

88
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:47,224
No!

89
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:49,104
What I mean is,

90
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,065
I want you to keep an eye on her.

91
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,544
Don't let anyone steal you away.

92
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:56,945
How could I?

93
00:07:58,224 --> 00:07:58,904
No one could.

94
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:11,544
If you don't eat the peanuts,

95
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:12,424
I'll take them.

96
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:15,145
Stop eating.

97
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:16,424
Eat the dishes first.

98
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:18,025
Xiaojue,

99
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,265
try this.

100
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:19,984
Have a taste.

101
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:22,945
I hear England doesn't have good food.

102
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,025
Eat as much as you can now.

103
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:29,505
We haven't parted yet,

104
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:31,224
and I already miss you.

105
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:33,664
Me too.

106
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,936
Not eating this? I'll take it.

107
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:46,664
You eat more too.

108
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:55,064
You Silly Goose! If I don't call you,

109
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,544
you won't call me, will you?

110
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,424
All you do is avoiding me every day.

111
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,584
Just avoid me!

112
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,128
(Incoming Call: Silly Goose)

113
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:13,465

Hello? Mengmeng.

115
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,304
Are you free tomorrow?

116
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:18,345
Yes.

117
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:22,664
Good. Let's meet at school tomorrow.

118
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:23,704
Not back for a long time.

119
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:24,704
Let's go look around.

120
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:25,944
Okay.

121
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:35,304
Silly Goose, that's not what I meant.

122
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,664
You're the best, the sweetest.

123
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:38,784
Love you.

124
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:05,225
(Dear friend,)

125
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:08,664
(I'll be here 24/7
to solve your problems.)

126
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,840
(Yunsheng Tower)

127
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,304
Miss Lin, come with me.

128
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:32,505
Mr. Fang.

129
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:34,704
Mr. Gao, why are you here?

130
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,064
I'm here

131
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:37,465
mainly to invite Miss Lin

132
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:40,304
to oversee marketing for Letao's
upcoming women's product line.

133
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,145
Letao and Yunsheng
will continue collaborating.

134
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:45,512
We'll even add 3 percent
to the commission.

135
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:49,145
Plus, Miss Lin will handle
all liaisons for Letao.

136
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:49,985
No problem.

137
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,865
I've already had the contract drafted.

138
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,584
Could you perhaps ask
the actual person involved?

139
00:10:57,225 --> 00:10:57,944
Are you willing?

140
00:10:57,944 --> 00:10:58,465
No.

141
00:10:58,465 --> 00:10:59,704
Yes, absolutely!

142
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:00,745
She must be willing.

143
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,745
I'll remove Miss Lin's workstation now.

144
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,505
No!

145
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,345
You're burning bridges.

146
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,824
You're basically kidnapping, get it?

147
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:08,304
Did I?

148
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:09,505
I'm taking her.

149
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:10,064
Absolutely.

150
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:10,544
You did.

151
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,584
- Take her away right now.
- You did.

152
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:12,664
Take her this instant!

153
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:13,304
No way.

154
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:14,105
Take her away now!

155
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,345
- What boss are you?
- You must take her!

156
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:16,824
Pleasure doing business.

157
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:17,704
Don't worry about it.

158
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:19,784
I'll have someone move
your workstation right away.

159
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:21,864
Pleasure working with you.

160
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,424
Hu Tiehan.

161
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,105
You arrived so early?

162
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:54,265
I'm on duty this afternoon.

163
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:57,465
Let's go.

164
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:04,345
Remember the first time we spoke?

165
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,145
Not really.

166
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,345
It hasn't even been that long.

167
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,544
But understandable.

168
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,625
All you cared
about back then were sports.

169
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:17,345
No surprise you forgot.

170
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:43,465
Well, Hu...

171
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:45,345
My name is Hu Tiehan.

172
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:46,784
Hu Tiehan.

173
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:49,944
I might hold you back
in the sports meet.

174
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:51,865
It's fine.

175
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:52,985
Need more practice.

176
00:12:58,904 --> 00:12:59,625
Sorry about that.

177
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,225
No worries. Keep going.

178
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:06,105
We barely interacted before.

179
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:07,944
Worried we wouldn't sync well.

180
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:10,465
But we actually have good chemistry.

181
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:12,544
We must win this sports meet.

182
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,304
Is winning really that important?

183
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:16,424
Of course.

184
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,584
Either do it properly,

185
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:18,944
or don't do it at all.

186
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:21,225
These days,

187
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,745
let's keep practicing after class.

188
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:23,625
Okay.

189
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:38,944
By the way, Mengmeng.

190
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,745
How's Huan'er and Xiaojue lately?

191
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,345
What do you mean?

192
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:48,105
Hasn't Huan'er mentioned anything?

193
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:52,064
She rarely talks about Xiaojue now.

194
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:54,145
Probably swamped with work.

195
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,544
Leaves early, and comes home late.

196
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,025
Why ask?

197
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,704
Did Xiaojue contact you?

198
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:03,465
No.

199
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,745
Nothing. Just curious.

200
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,105
Hu Tiehan,

201
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,824
you didn't ask me
out just for this, right?

202
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,664
Couldn't you have called instead?

203
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:15,465
No.

204
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:17,704
Mengmeng, you know.

205
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,625
Xiaojue asked me to look out
for her before he left.

206
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,184
Okay.

207
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,424
I knew it. You only call
when you need something.

208
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:31,184
Let's make the most of our time then.

209
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:32,904
Don't you have duty soon?

210
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,465
Mr. Gao arranged it.

211
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,304
This is your desk.

212
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:45,584
Thank you.

213
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,904
A new colleague Mr. Gao arranged?

214
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:49,625
Did you get wind of this?

215
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:50,664
No.

216
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:56,664
Hey.

217
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:59,025
Should we go say hello then?

218
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,184
Let's go.

219
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,145
Hello,

220
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,584
(Zhao Jia)
I'm Zhao Jia.

221
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:07,865
(Qian Bing)
Hello, I'm Qian Bing.

222
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,145
(Sun Yi)
Hello, I'm Sun Yi.

223
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:11,105
Jia, Yi, Bing?

224
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,985
Your NPC names seem a bit random,
don't they? How imaginative.

225
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:17,544
Miss Lin.

226
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:17,944
Yes.

227
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,304
Mr. Gao said the marketing plan
you did earlier was excellent.

228
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:23,505
Just needs a few tweaks.

229
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,465
He's already noted them.

230
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:26,505
Got it. I'll revise it this afternoon.

231
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,745
Here's the related information
and product samples.

232
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:31,625
Review it and provide a revised plan
by the end of today.

233
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,465
Go, go, go!

234
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,544
Mr. Gao.

235
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,664
I'm done with today's work.

236
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,225
Need me to bring you some supper?

237
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:36,544
Sure.

238
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:37,664
The usual?

239
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:40,944
Wait.

240
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,145
Luo, I'll leave first.

241
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:56,865
Appreciate it.

242
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,064
Thanks.

243
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,265
But I've almost finished
the tasks Mr. Gao assigned me.

244
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:10,624
Just a moment, I'll...

245
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:11,240
You're welcome.

246
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:14,864
Mr. Gao said the plan you made
this afternoon is good.

247
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,104
But it needs a few adjustments.

248
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:16,985
He's marked them out.

249
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,144
Get it done tonight.

250
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:19,025
Good luck.

251
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,025
Wait.

252
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:51,544
Don't even ask.

253
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:54,144
I was absolutely slammed today.

254
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:57,025
My boss, I don't know
what got into him today. He...

255
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:01,544
Can't talk now.
I'm getting in the elevator.

256
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,745
You seemed very dissatisfied with me.

257
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:11,985
Not as much resentment
as you harbor towards me.

258
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:15,985
Still, thanks for the wontons.

259
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,745
They taste a bit like the ones
from that place

260
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:19,745
we ate at before.

261
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,425
Luo grabbed randomly.

262
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:22,705
No wonder.

263
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:24,265
The taste isn't quite the same.

264
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:26,665
Really?

265
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:29,384
Yes, it's perfectly normal.

266
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,544
Yesterday's wontons and today's wontons

267
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,144
can't possibly taste exactly identical.

268
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:34,425
Just like people.

269
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,584
Someone might be fine yesterday,

270
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:38,705
but suddenly start
acting so harsh today.

271
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,144
What do you mean?

272
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,505
Mr. Gao, aren't you heading home?

273
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,104
What else would I be doing?

274
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:46,304
I thought you were waiting for someone.

275
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:47,705
You didn't press the button.

276
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,225
Got it.

277
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,864
Boss, let me press it for you.

278
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:01,104
(Huan'er, I bought supper.)

279
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,505
(Let's eat together at home.)

280
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,104
(No, thanks.)

281
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,465
(I already ate at the office.)

282
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:30,905
By the way, can I expense the cab fare?

283
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:36,824
You're back.

284
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:40,905
Listen.

285
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,265
This Gao Haiming...

286
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:45,665
He must have some weird fetish.

287
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,544
He just loves tormenting people.

288
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:48,584
What did he do?

289
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:50,905
He's tormenting me.

290
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,505
He tried so hard
to transfer me to Letao,

291
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,425
right next to him,

292
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:56,745
just to make it easier to torment me.

293
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,384
He wants me to work myself to death.

294
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,824
Well, that's a relief.

295
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,505
Tiehan actually asked me
about you and Xiaojue today.

296
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:07,584
What did he ask?

297
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:10,465
Just how you are doing lately,

298
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,745
and if you've been arguing.

299
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,265
I felt you've been getting a bit close
to Gao Haiming recently.

300
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:16,945
But now, it seems

301
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,465
he's exploiting you so hard,

302
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:19,985
so I feel much better.

303
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:23,705
Have a drink.

304
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:29,905
Mengmeng,

305
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,705
why do you like Hu Tiehan so much?

306
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:34,384
He doesn't even treat you well.

307
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,945
He treats me very well.

308
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,104
You don't know.

309
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:38,624
Zhu Mengmeng.

310
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:46,745
What do you want?

311
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,025
I have money. Take it.

312
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,064
Don't.

313
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:55,104
It'll be endless then.

314
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,304
What do you mean?

315
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,225
Playing the hero, huh?

316
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,425
Maybe he sees that Zhu Mengmeng is rich
and wants to borrow some too.

317
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,665
I'm warning you. Don't cause trouble.

318
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,344
We're doing it anyway.

319
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:07,544
What?

320
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:12,344
Mr. Zhang?

321
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:16,544
I won't let you off the hook!

322
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:24,905
Thank you.

323
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,504
It's okay. Glad you're safe.

324
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:28,344
Let me walk you home.

325
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,384
Will they cause trouble for you later?

326
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,225
I'm not afraid.

327
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,025
Let's go.

328
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,905
Isn't playing the hero a bit cliché,

329
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:44,584
Mengmeng?

330
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:45,824
Huan'er!

331
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:46,705
Fine.

332
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,064
As long as you like it.

333
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:54,665
Mengmeng,

334
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:56,344
why is this hydrating mist here?

335
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:59,265
My friend brought it back from England.

336
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:00,985
England?

337
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:03,544
(He's targeting me like this.)

338
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,465
(Could it be because he's jealous?)

339
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:08,185
(Maybe I should test it.)

340
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:10,304
Do you want it? I can get you a new one.

341
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:12,624
No. Just lend me this one for a day.

342
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:13,665
Sure.

343
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,096
Morning, Mr. Gao.

344
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:17,784
Mr. Gao.

345
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:18,544
Morning.

346
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,025
Mr. Gao.

347
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:21,064
Morning.

348
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:24,025
Morning, Mr. Gao.

349
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:24,384
Morning.

350
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:33,505
Huan'er,

351
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:34,505
what's this?

352
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:36,104
Hydrating mist.

353
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:38,945
My friend from England gave it to me.

354
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:40,544
It works really well. Try it.

355
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:10,144
Isn't it just a hydrating mist?

356
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,104
It isn't necessarily that...

357
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:12,985
Did I talk to you?

358
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:21,824
Sir, call me if you need anything.

359
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,945
Is Mr. Huang coming back
from Hong Kong, China today?

360
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:28,945
Yes.

361
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,745
Tell him to call me.
Bring something for me.

362
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:33,104
Bring what?

363
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:34,472
Did I allow you to ask?

364
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:57,992
(Letao Tower)

365
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:00,144
It's for you.

366
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:01,384
From who?

367
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:02,696
Did I allow you to ask?

368
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:04,544
Scrap the old one.

369
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:21,624
(Bought so much?
Planning to bathe in it?)

370
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:25,225
(Is he trying to charm me to death?)

371
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:31,624
Well, dear colleagues.

372
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:32,968
It's from my friend.

373
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:34,544
A whole box. Everyone gets one.

374
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:35,624
Here you go.

375
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,745
- Thanks, Huan'er.
- Thanks, Huan'er.

376
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,025
- Nothing.
- You're so generous.

377
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:41,705
It's high-end.

378
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:42,745
We rarely see it usually.

379
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:43,544
Take it.

380
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:44,505
Thank you, Huan'er.

381
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:10,985
Hello?

382
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:12,624
Starting tomorrow,

383
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:14,784
you'll replace Luo
as my special assistant.

384
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:16,665
Pick me up for work at 7 AM.

385
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,064
Mr. Gao?

386
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:21,745
You know my home address very well.

387
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,384
One minute late,
and I'll deduct a full day's pay.

388
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:26,624
Fine.

389
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:29,025
But it's already very late, so...

390
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:30,304
Hello?

391
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,144
Playing games, huh?

392
00:25:40,344 --> 00:25:40,945
Alright then.

393
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,745
Miss Lin, you can wait inside.

394
00:25:52,745 --> 00:25:53,665
I'll call Mr. Gao down.

395
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:54,665
It's okay.

396
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:55,945
Don't tell him.

397
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,144
He can come down anytime.

398
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:57,945
I'll wait here.

399
00:25:58,104 --> 00:26:00,185
I'm not rushing him at all.

400
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,425
Okay, wait a moment.

401
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:30,425
Mr. Gao.

402
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:32,624
Miss Lin is waiting outside.

403
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:33,624
She seems rushed.

404
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:34,824
I see.

405
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,144
Morning, Mr. Gao.

406
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,225
Morning.

407
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:06,064
Let's go. Head out.

408
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:06,544
Wait.

409
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:10,905
This bowtie of yours

410
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:12,824
isn't tied very well.

411
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,665
Let me tie it again for you.

412
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:16,384
Okay.

413
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:57,344
I've tied you an Eldredge knot.

414
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,225
This knot might look a bit exaggerated.

415
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:02,784
But since your suit today
is quite understated,

416
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:03,745
and the tie is bold,

417
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:05,144
it balances things out perfectly.

418
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:09,064
How did you know it?

419
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:12,064
I specifically studied this.

420
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:15,784
Why would you study that?

421
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,465
Well...

422
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:22,304
Of course, it was for a certain man.

423
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:28,544
Not going to the office today.

424
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,425
No need to drive me.

425
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,425
I learned it especially for you.

426
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:41,544
That won't do?

427
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:44,104
Are you crazy?

428
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:02,665
(Why would you study that?)

429
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:04,905
Of course, it was for a certain man.

430
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:33,896
You're here, Huan'er.

431
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,425
Huan'er, why are you so late today?

432
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:57,304
All thanks to a certain someone.

433
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,144
When did he get here?

434
00:30:02,945 --> 00:30:03,624
Mr. Gao?

435
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,025
He arrived super early this morning.
Before nine, I think.

436
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:08,784
Really?

437
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,544
(What appointment?)

438
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:13,584
(He's targeting me.)

439
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:15,624
(Playing games with me, huh?)

440
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:17,784
(Fine, I'm done putting up with this.)

441
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:32,344
Are you sure?

442
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:33,584
Absolutely sure.

443
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,864
So much work and the cold shoulder.

444
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:37,505
Of course, she's overwhelmed.

445
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:38,945
Luo,

446
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,265
do you think Mr. Gao
and Lin Huan'er are...

447
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:46,905
But it is really too much.

448
00:30:51,544 --> 00:30:52,304
What are you doing?

449
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:53,465
Get back to work!

450
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:09,185
Sir,

451
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:12,344
on Lin Huan'er, are we being too...

452
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,344
It's all her fault.

453
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:33,304
(Email)
(Ou Xiaojue?)

454
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:35,745
(Right, what does he look like?)

455
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,745
Mr. Gao, do you have any instructions?

456
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:09,705
Come with me.

457
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:18,144
(Finally, you lose patience, huh?)

458
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:20,985
Tiehan.

459
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:22,505
Come on. Grab a meal.

460
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:23,905
We finally wrapped things up.

461
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:25,864
No, thanks. You guys go ahead.

462
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,384
Everyone's waiting there.

463
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,025
Got things to do. You go.

464
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:30,465
Okay.

465
00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:32,745
I'll head over first then.

466
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:33,584
Take care.

467
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,025
Okay.

468
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:45,480
(Mengmeng, have time? We need to talk.)

469
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:00,025
The atmosphere here is really quiet.

470
00:33:00,064 --> 00:33:01,265
The food tastes good too.

471
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:02,905
Take a look. See what you like.

472
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:03,584
Okay.

473
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,285
(Snow Velvet Moon Gazing, 66 yuan)

474
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:15,425
Snow Velvet Moon Gazing is delicious.

475
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,344
(Eel Claypot Rice, 88 yuan)
This Eel Claypot Rice is also good.

476
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:27,985
What's wrong?

477
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:29,784
Nothing you like to eat?

478
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:31,624
Should we try another?

479
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,705
No, no need. This place is fine.

480
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:39,465
Excuse me.

481
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,465
One Snow Velvet Moon Gazing, please.

482
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:47,144
And one Eel Claypot Rice, thank you.

483
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:48,144
Make that two.

484
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:49,465
Thanks.

485
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,584
Okay, please wait a moment.

486
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:12,064
Hu?

487
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:15,624
Mengmeng?

488
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:16,584
Huan'er?
