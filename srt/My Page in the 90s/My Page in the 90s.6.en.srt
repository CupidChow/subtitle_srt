189
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,460
Miss Lin, what can I do for you?

190
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,340
Well,

191
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,179
time is tight.

192
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,140
I'll be brief.

193
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
I'm nowhere.

194
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,179
I know no one here.

195
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:31,980
There's not anyone

196
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,740
or a car in sight.

197
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,819
If possible,

198
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:34,779
please tell Mengmeng

199
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:35,500
and my family

200
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,899
I might not make it back today.

201
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:38,579
Okay.

202
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,659
Don't worry, I'll pass it along.

203
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,579
Wait, Mr. Gao, what I meant is

204
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:43,620
if you're free now,

205
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,899
can you come and save me?

206
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,579
I'm at Nantong Mountain's Rose...

207
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,939
Hello?

208
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,140
Hello?

209
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,620
Hello?

210
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,260
That's it?

211
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,699
That was short.

212
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,020
Luo? Luo!

213
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,939
Mr. Gao.

214
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,440
Look into places near Nantong Mountain
starting with "Rose".

215
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,699
Got it. I'm on it.

216
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,299
This weather

217
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,500
looks like rain.

218
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:26,659
Please, I'm struggling enough.

219
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,059
Don't make this harder for me.

220
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:28,819
Okay?

221
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,740
Please don't rain.

222
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,620
I won't complain about you, okay?

223
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,460
I mean it. I won't.

224
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,500
Don't you dare rain now.

225
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,299
No way.

226
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,460
(Could someone)

227
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,860
(suddenly appear and save me?)

228
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:06,819
Let's go.

229
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,659
Gao Haiming,

230
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,620
if you come pick me up right now,

231
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,260
I'll let bygones be bygones

232
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,299
and forgive you.

233
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,500
Miss, why are you here?

234
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,819
I'm a taxi driver.
I just finished my shift.

235
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:13,819
Let me give you a ride.

236
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:14,980
Sure, thanks.

237
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,260
I see you don't have shoes.

238
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,860
I happen to have a pair right here.

239
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,819
Put these on for now.

240
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:19,779
Thank you so much.

241
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:20,380
You're welcome.

242
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,659
Come on, get in quick.

243
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:24,011
Thank you.

244
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,299
I have a bag of things here.

245
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:32,340
You can use them.

246
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,539
Tissues?

247
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,340
A towel?

248
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,539
A thermos?

249
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:41,980
Clean socks?

250
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,620
And a jacket?

251
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,860
I get it.

252
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,740
You're the Newbie Pack
the system sent me, aren't you?

253
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:51,179
It's fine.

254
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,020
I get it.

255
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,860
Drive on.

256
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,539
Alright.

257
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,299
- You lousy system.
- Buckle up now.

258
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,340
You do have some decency.

Do this.

Get a towel, a jacket,

265

Hello.

Give this bag to her.

273
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,579
But tell her it's from you.

276
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,980
Got it. Don't worry.

277
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,619

285
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,460
Sir, take me to Fuchuang International.

286
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,579
Thanks.

287
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,500
Miss Xie,

288
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,740
here are the files you wanted.

289
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,928
Luckily, they didn't get wet.

290
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,299
You picked the right moment.

291
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:25,980
I was just about to leave.

292
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,379
After all this trouble,

293
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,779
are you satisfied now?

294
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,339
Just mediocre.

295
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,260
I wish you'd just disappear
from my life forever.

296
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,940
Funny, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

297
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,660
So listen carefully

298
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,740
to what I say next.

299
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,099
You have a critical flaw.

300
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,579
You're trying too hard.

301
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,900
but in the wrong direction.

302
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,940
Targeting me like this

303
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,819
might make you feel a bit better,

304
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
but does this get you

305
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,700
Gao Haiming's affection?

306
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,660
So,

307
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:00,779
figure out

308
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,180
what you truly want first.

309
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,299
Then work towards that.

310
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,220
That's my business.

311
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,900
What's it to you?

312
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,779
I'm just trying to tell you,

313
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,500
we shouldn't be rivals.

314
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm not the person
you need to deal with.

315
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,379
It should be Gao Haiming.

316
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,379
Focus on winning over Gao Haiming.

317
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,339
If you only target me,

318
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,900
even if you launch me into space,

319
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,260
new girls will continue

320
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,420
to appear around Gao Haiming.

321
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,180
Right?

322
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,260
And Miss Xie,

323
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:28,779
you're so beautiful,

324
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,139
charming,

325
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:31,180
and accomplished.

326
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,339
You shouldn't just be

327
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,260
a supporting character

328
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,260
in Gao Haiming's story.

329
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,660
You should be the female lead

330
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,900
in your own story.

331
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,220
Understand?

332
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,260
I'm done.

333
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,260
Go for it.

334
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,220
Being the female lead in my own story?

335
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,619
I need to be more proactive.

336
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,859
and make Gao Haiming
be a supporting role to me.

337
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,500
Mr. Gao. Mr. Gao.

338
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,299
We have a problem. Miss Xie is here.

339
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,020
Come on everyone, have some snacks.

340
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,139
Miss Xie is treating you all

341
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,740
to afternoon tea on Mr. Gao's behalf.

342
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,180
- Thank you.
- Here.

343
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,260
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

344
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,099
You're welcome. Here.

345
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:28,180
Thank you.

346
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,339
Mr. Gao, Miss Xie is very thoughtful.

347
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,220
But you can't force love.

348
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,220
She's completely wasting her time.

349
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,700
Are our company's doors

350
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,139
open to anyone?

351
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,900
Thank you.
Wishing you and Mr. Gao happiness.

352
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:46,020
Thank you.

353
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,059
Have other colleagues

354
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,139
get afternoon tea too.

355
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:48,740
Got it.

356
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,900
It must be the Chairman who let her in.

357
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,339
Here, Huan'er.

358
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,619
Take the cold medicine.

359
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,420
Look at you.

360
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,740
Why not go home and rest?

361
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm fine. This is nothing.

362
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,260
I can't rest now.

363
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:14,500
Outstanding.

364
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang.

365
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,020
Is this contract
supposed to go to Letao?

366
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:28,900
I can do it.

367
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,740
You've got a cold?

368
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,660
This contract...

369
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,260
It's already processed.

370
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,579
But in your condition...

371
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:39,099
(Letao Maternal and Infant PR Contract)
I-I'll deliver it.

372
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,299
Not appropriate.

373
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:41,544
(Letao Maternal and Infant PR Contract)

374
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,379
I must personally...

375
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,180
She's going that far?

376
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:49,980
Impressive.

377
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:55,980
Haiming.

378
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,859
Miss Xie.

379
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,180
I must discuss key business
with Mr. Gao.

380
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,900
You may leave.

381
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,779
Don't enter unless called.

382
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,420
Go.

383
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,940
Haiming,

384
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,420
I made these myself.

385
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:15,220
Try some.

386
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,460
Miss Xie, what brings you here today?

387
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:27,859
I drafted it these past few days.

388
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,260
The Fuchuang and Letao
Strategic Cooperation Agreement.

389
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,139
Please take a look.

390
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,059
Just send it to our legal department.

391
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:38,819
If there's nothing else...

392
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:39,740
Haiming,

393
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,059
we grew up together.

394
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,940
A decade-long friendship

395
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,740
is truly rare.

396
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,619
That was all childhood stuff.

397
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:56,180
Miss Lin.

398
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,819
Miss Lin.
Mr. Gao and Miss Xie are inside.

399
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:00,700
No one's allowed in.

400
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:02,139
Miss Xie is here?

401
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:04,660
I'm delivering a file to Mr. Gao.

402
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,819
If you go in

403
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,339
and he gets mad, he'll yell at me.

404
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:09,779
I'll take responsibility.

405
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:10,379
You're safe.

406
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:14,900
When we were little,

407
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
to pick a flower for me,

408
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,379
you got scratched by a branch.

409
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,099
Let me see if the scar remains.

410
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,020
It's gone, Miss Xie.

411
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,819
- It's gone.
- Let me see.

412
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,539
It's gone already.

413
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,779
- Let me...
- It's really gone.

414
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,539
My timing couldn't be worse.

415
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,740
Well, you two carry on.

416
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,500
When you're done,

417
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I'll discuss work with Mr. Gao.

418
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:39,099
Lin Huan'er, it's you again.

419
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:43,980
Are these the cookies you gave Mr. Gao?

420
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,859
How could you send cookies?

421
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:47,379
Mr. Gao quit sugar ages ago.

422
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:48,500
Didn't you know?

423
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:50,819
No worries.

424
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,980
Learn more before gifting next time.

425
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:54,859
It's easier after the first.

426
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,700
Just don't send sweets next time.

427
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,619
He dislikes them.

428
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,980
None of your business. Get out.

429
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,460
Wait, you...

430
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,859
Miss Xie,
Miss Lin is my business partner.

431
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:11,859
This isn't appropriate.

432
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,980
You're defending her?

433
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,619
All partners are equal with me.

434
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,260
If there's nothing else today,

435
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,660
we'll talk another time.

436
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:26,420
Take care.

437
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,299
Are you okay?

438
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:34,819
You're sick?

439
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,099
Thanks to you.

440
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,740
I got sick
after getting caught in the rain.

441
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,099
You owe me for this.

442
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:47,339
Then how can I repay you?

443
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,779
You can owe me for now.

444
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,220
Wait till I think of how.

445
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,579
Deal.

446
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,024
I'll get you a leave and take you home.

447
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,339
(Male lead's fondness)

448
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,940
(toward you rose to 22 percent.)

449
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:18,420
I was just about to call you, Huan'er.

450
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
Are you feeling better?

451
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,500
I'm out shopping.

452
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,460
Come join me.

453
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,940
Shopping at this hour?

454
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,619
Aren't I going
to the police station event tomorrow?

455
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,539
I wanted to get some new outfits.

456
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,740
Going to the event?

457
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,059
For that romantically dense guy?

458
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,900
Got it.

459
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,020
I understand.

460
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:42,900
Enjoy your shopping then.

461
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,539
I won't join you tonight.

462
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,460
I'll get you some supper later.

463
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,420
No need. I'm not hungry.

464
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,020
Alright. Get some rest.

465
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,099
Hello?

466
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,139
Hello. Why aren't you here today?

467
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,900
The event starts soon.

468
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,020
Attendance

469
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,299
doesn't match registrations.

470
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,576
My superior is asking me.

471
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,539
I probably can't make it today.

472
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,260
What's wrong? Feeling unwell?

473
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,660
Not me. Huan'er.

474
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,859
Is she better?

475
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,260
She should be feeling better now.

476
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,339
Officer, you're so handsome.

477
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,180
Excuse me.

478
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,420
Can you show me this?

479
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,980
Yeah, hold on.

480
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,299
Sorry.

481
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:49,740
Everyone's pairing up now.

482
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,700
I need to go.

483
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,139
Wait.

484
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,619
Pairing up?

485
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,980
So dramatic.

486
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,539
It's just a little rain.

487
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,059
She ran to Haiming
to play the delicate one.

488
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,139
Is that necessary?

489
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,660
Wanjun, if you want
to achieve big things,

490
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,539
you can't lose your cool.

491
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,500
Dad, it's not me losing my cool.

492
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,980
It's Lin Huan'er

493
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,900
who is incredibly cunning.

494
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,420
This move

495
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,980
not only made Haiming
feel sorry for her,

496
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:35,819
but also painted me

497
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:37,099
as a petty and malicious person.

498
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,379
I will think of something.

499
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,660
Do you want

500
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:47,059
to speed things up with Haiming?

501
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:49,859
Of course.

502
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,059
Then visit him tomorrow

503
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,900
to discuss this matter properly.

504
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,619
Tomorrow?

505
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,220
Sooner rather than later.

506
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,260
Letao is transitioning.

507
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,539
They need our support.

508
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Sooner or later,

509
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,579
Letao will rely on our Fuchuang.

510
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,500
He won't escape you then.

511
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:14,088
(Letao Tower)

512
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,299
Mr. Gao,

513
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,579
Mr. Lin and Mr. Huang

514
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:23,112
are in supplier renewal negotiation.

515
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,299
Due to the recent

516
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,500
diaper insect infestation,

517
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,099
agency prices have fluctuated.

518
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:28,139
They hope

519
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,420
we can offer some plans soon

520
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,339
to reduce the impact

521
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:31,500
and enhance brand influence.

522
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,660
Make an international call
to Mr. Lin and Mr. Huang now.

523
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,859
First renew the contracts,
then plan the marketing.

524
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,180
Understood.

525
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
How's our plan?

526
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:45,980
The factory heads will arrive tomorrow.

527
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,500
The meeting time is up to you.

528
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,539
And the materials and R&D team?

529
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:50,700
All arranged.

530
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,859
Dr. Zhang is pretty much
on board to sign.

531
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,260
Got it.

532
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,736
(Yunsheng Tower)

533
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,020
(He sent me home when I was sick)

534
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,299
(and got me yellow peach cans.)

535
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,539
(Plus the comforting text.)

536
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,460
(He must like me, right?)

537
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,819
(Why is the fondness still 22 percent?)

538
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,420
(Fondness: 22.2 percent)

539
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,500
(22.2 percent?)

540
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,900
Huan'er, here.

541
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:23,099
Fuchuang requires us

542
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:24,500
to deliver the next quarter's

543
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,539
marketing concept

544
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,740
and proposal

545
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,539
for Hongsen Supermarket by 3 PM today.

546
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:29,900
- (You went to a loan shark?)
- Then we should

547
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,379
- (Some men in black came.)
- make sure to deliver...

548
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,619
(Don't come back.)

549
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:33,859
(Remember, stay away.)

550
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,740
Something seems to have happened
at my home.

551
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:38,740
Something happened?

552
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,139
Most likely.

553
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:41,299
Then you should go quickly.

554
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,280
Then...

555
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:43,500
Work isn't important.

556
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,619
Family comes first.

557
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:46,900
- Thanks.
- Wang Zhen,

558
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:48,200
you go.

559
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:51,660
What's going on?

560
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,139
Where's my home?

561
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,460
You've misunderstood. We didn't do it.

562
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,900
You're accusing the wrong people.

563
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,940
We're all good people here.

564
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,980
Is this the place?

565
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,139
Sweetie.

566
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,859
Yeah, here.

567
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:14,020
You came back after all.

568
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,020
Come quickly.

569
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,619
Miss Lin,

570
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,619
you're finally back.

571
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,139
We only came to deliver a message,

572
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:20,660
but Mr. Lin won't let us leave now.

573
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,059
Total misunderstanding.

574
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,260
What are you talking about?

575
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,660
Sweetie, they hit me.

576
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,779
Sir, you're lying.

577
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,500
Did you hit him? Did you?

578
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,099
Impossible! How could we hit you?

579
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,379
Would we dare hit him?

580
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:34,020
No? And then?

581
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,299
Don't listen to him at all.

582
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,740
We couldn't possibly hit anyone.

583
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
And they smashed up our place. Look.

584
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,020
That didn't happen at all.

585
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,099
We couldn't have done it.

586
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:42,500
You're misled. Don't believe him.

587
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,700
He smashed our place.

588
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,859
He smashed everything.

589
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,379
- Alright.
- Everything!

590
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:47,420
Quiet. Be quiet.

591
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,579
Let me sort this out.

592
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,619
First, let me get this straight.

593
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,339
You're my alcoholic dad, right?

594
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:55,299
I didn't drink today.

595
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,420
You didn't drink today?

596
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:57,859
Then I should have

597
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,099
a loner sister.

598
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,740
I'm right here.

599
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,619
What's going on?

600
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,099
Dad, stop acting.

601
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,220
She won't believe you.

602
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,299
What are you talking about?

603
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,940
You can't side with outsiders.

604
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,819
You're young.

605
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:11,779
You wouldn't lie.

606
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,779
I'll listen to you.

607
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,660
You never came home.

608
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,940
So Dad seized the chance

609
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,099
to lure you back.

610
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:20,260
And them?

611
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,660
They said you took money
from their boss,

612
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,740
but didn't do the job well.

613
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,779
So they wanted Dad to help them out.

614
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:28,379
You work for Mr. Gao?

615
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,180
Miss Lin, we really didn't hit anyone.

616
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,740
The mess on the floor wasn't our doing.

617
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,379
Yes, we're professionals.

618
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:35,528
- We're pros.
- We wouldn't do such things.

619
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:36,099
Right.

620
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,099
You are pros?

621
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:38,579
Then how did Sweetie and Spicy

622
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:39,500
fall on the floor?

623
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,660
Who smashed them? Who?

624
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,779
It wasn't us.

625
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:43,500
We don't know who did it.

626
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:45,660
Regarding Sweetie and Spicy,

627
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,260
if it was you guys...

628
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,420
All right. You can leave.

629
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,059
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

630
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,139
Stop.

631
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,299
Where's Mr. Gao?

632
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,139
Take me to see him.

633
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,059
Sweetie, you can't go with them.

634
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,579
They're all bad guys. It's dangerous.

635
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:07,500
Enough. They're just workers.

636
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,020
Yes.

637
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Exactly. We're just workhorses.

638
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,980
Then are you coming back?

639
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:14,579
I'll be right back.

640
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,579
I'll cook something tasty while I wait.

641
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,304
Okay, no problem.

642
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:20,072
You cook.

643
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,819
Lead the way.

644
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:22,660
Okay.

645
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:24,500
Take care of Dad.

646
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,539
Don't worry.

647
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,819
Remember to call us.

648
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,020
Sweetie and Spicy.

649
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,379
I can't turn in my homework.

650
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,099
The teacher will scold me.

651
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,128
(Exclusive: Letao CEO Gao Haiming
Dating Mysterious Woman)

652
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:05,139
Hello?

653
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:06,660
Haiming, it's me.

654
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,059
Sir.

655
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm at the cigar bar now.

656
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,900
Don't hang up the phone.

657
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,740
I'll be meeting Lin Huan'er soon.

658
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,260
I want you to hear

659
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,500
what kind of woman

660
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,139
Lin Huan'er really is.

661
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,660
(Exclusive)
This was your doing, right?

662
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,420
Yes.

663
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,420
I arranged it.

664
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,539
The photos turned out well, right?

665
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:57,819
As you can see,

666
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,460
Gao Haiming and I are currently in love.

667
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:01,900
Love deeply.

668
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:07,579
You sound so self-righteous.

669
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,820
Don't forget

670
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,179
what you promised me when you

671
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,340
took my money in the car.

672
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,860
Mr. Gao.

673
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,059
Taking payment and doing the job

674
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,579
is perfectly justified, right?

675
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,699
Now you act one way in front of me

676
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,099
and another behind my back.

677
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,699
Isn't that rather underhanded?

678
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,059
Mr. Gao, you sent people
to harass my family.

679
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,340
Was that not underhanded?

680
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,340
It seems I didn't offer you

681
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,460
enough incentive, did I?

682
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,020
I wasn't wrong about you.

683
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,460
You're truly a greedy

684
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,059
and insatiable woman.

685
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,900
I admit it.

686
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,340
Not only am I vain.

687
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,179
I'm also insatiably greedy.

688
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,380
How candidly you admit it.

689
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,860
I rather like that.

690
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,460
Tell me.

691
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,659
How much do you want

692
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,259
to leave my son?

693
00:34:59,139 --> 00:34:59,940
Name your price.

694
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,820
You seem to have forgotten
our five-month arrangement.

695
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,940
I remember the five-month agreement.

696
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
I thought you were setting up

697
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,020
for an expensive breakup settlement.

698
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:13,739
But I never expected

699
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,860
it was merely your stalling tactic.

700
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,259
Your real goal

701
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:19,659
has been to latch onto my son Haiming,

702
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,219
climbing the social ladder.

703
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,500
How delusional you are.

704
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:25,500
You're not just insatiable.

705
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,020
You're also scheming.

706
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,219
My point is,

707
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,739
Gao Haiming isn't some puppet.

708
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,460
How could I possibly control him

709
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,699
to execute my plans?

710
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:39,940
Likewise,

711
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,020
I doubt you can control him either.

712
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,659
Why would I control him?

713
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,860
We're perfectly fine.

714
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,980
Why would I control him?

715
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,820
I just want him to realize

716
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
what kind of woman

717
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,380
by his side truly is.

718
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,020
If I were you,

719
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,619
before summoning that woman here,

720
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:03,460
I'd have talked to my son first

721
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,820
to understand his perspective.

722
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,059
Is he my son

723
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,099
or your son?

724
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,300
Don't I know him?

725
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:13,860
Why should I talk with him?

726
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,940
I only need to talk to you.

727
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,739
Stop beating around the bush.

728
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,699
I'll ask you one last time.

729
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,219
Just how much money

730
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,460
will it take for you to leave my son?

731
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
It seems to you

732
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,659
that only money can solve problems.

733
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,780
I don't think
you understand Gao Haiming at all.

734
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,699
Nor do you know what he needs

735
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:46,059
and what he truly wants.

736
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,460
Or rather,

737
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,699
you simply don't care.

738
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:56,460
By the way, Mr. Gao.

739
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,820
No need to count it.

740
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,619
