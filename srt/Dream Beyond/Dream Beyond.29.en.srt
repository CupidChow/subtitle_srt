00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,720
Li Ruiyu

2
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,600
Dong Dongdong, Chen Xi

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,360
Dong Dongdong, Chen Xi

4
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,320
Li Zhiting (Hong Kong, China), Xu Lu

5
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
Zhuo Peng, very professional!

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,960
Well done!

7
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,240
I thought Lizhong Study Abroad was finished.

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,360
This is Gu Nian's vision on New Year's Eve,

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,090
I think it has great potential.

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, it's you, Gu Nian.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,120
Not bad, Nian Nian.

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
No, no,

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
I was just thinking out loud.

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Teacher Zhuo is the impressive one.

15
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,360
The concept and operation model of Lizhong Study Abroad

16
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
is that we must strictly evaluate

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,420
the teaching abilities of our instructors.

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,840
The platform only charges the most basic operational fees,

19
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
reducing costs for students while increasing teachers' income.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
If we encounter

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,690
exceptional students who temporarily cannot afford the fees,

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,960
we help them with their applications first,

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,360
and they can pay us back after successfully studying abroad.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,440
This is humane.

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Installment payments for consulting fees.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,090
That's a great idea.

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Next,

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,120
we need to enter the trial operation phase.

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,650
Currently, two students are willing to join.

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
If anyone is interested,

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,130
you can provide tutoring for these two students.

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,380
That's wonderful!

33
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,400
It's a win-win situation.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll sign up first.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,170
I'll sign up too.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,860
I need to get to work. You carry on.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
During the trial operation phase,

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
we need to record the screen.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,560
First, it's for reference purposes.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,000
If it's good enough,

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,079
we can include it in the teacher's materials

42
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,480
for students to refer to.

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
So I'll be on camera?

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,560
Should I get a haircut then?

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,120
Don't bother.

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,800
You're not cut out to be a heartthrob.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,320
I rely on my personality charm.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
You really don't know how to talk nicely, do you?

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
What?

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,440
The first girl who agreed to help us with internal testing

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
is called Chen Yingxi.

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
It's our friend

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Chen Yingxi.

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,520
Who?

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,920
I've already arranged it,

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Chen Yingxi is very happy to receive our tutoring.

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,200
She's currently a senior in high school

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
and might apply to American universities in the future.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Juan, I'll leave the girl to you.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,120
I'll send you her information later.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,079
Okay, got it.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
Good.

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,320
What about me? Boy or girl?

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,130
Both boys and girls.

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Just two students total and we get both genders?

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,820
You're really fooling yourself.

67
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,320
Alright, it's settled then.

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
Come in.

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,040
Teacher Zhuo,

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,200
I didn't expect you'd remember

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,000
what I said about the study abroad company

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,460
when we were setting off fireworks that day.

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,880
It's nothing. I thought what you said made a lot of sense.

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,600
Besides, haven't you been concerned about

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,520
Chen Yingxi's future undergraduate studies?

76
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
I want to ease your worries.

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,480
Teacher Zhuo, thank you so much.

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm really touched.

79
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't mention it.

80
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,600
Now that Lizhong Study Abroad's new program has launched,

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
you'll need to work hard to help out.

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
Once the website reopens,

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,160
many teachers will apply to join,

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,120
students will be asking questions,

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,250
and all this administrative work is quite troublesome.

86
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Would you like to give it a try?

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Sure,

88
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,840
I'm definitely not qualified to be a teacher,

89
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
but organizing materials and answering questions,

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,320
I should be able to handle that.

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
Are you sure?

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,770
It will take up your study time.

93
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
This isn't the only thing taking up my time.

94
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
Nian Nian, Zhuo Peng, dinner's ready.

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,360
Coming!

96
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,640
Let's go eat.

97
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
How did it go?

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,290
Actually, this is just the first set of practice questions.

99
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
Was it that bad?

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Keke,

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,320
many people struggle when they first start with these questions.

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,880
What's my score?

103
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,480
Do you know the correct answers?

104
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Keke, I've done this set several times already.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,100
I am the answer key.

106
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,520
I have a PhD.

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
Forget it.

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,440
This is just how I am.

109
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,370
Don't waste your time on me.

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,960
Let's try again.

111
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,400
It'll be the same result if we try again.

112
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,280
I... I just can't take tests.

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
There must be a solution,

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,020
we'll figure it out together.

115
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,200
Fine, fine. I'm done trying.

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,400
I need to get to work.

117
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,960
You can figure it out on your own.

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,800
Keke!

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
20 minutes.

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,520
Treating the root cause.

121
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
You know what she needs most right now,

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
don't you?

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,159
That's why I told you,

124
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,440
have Coco get a real estate license.

125
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,600
She can sell her own house,

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
and with that license,

127
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,159
she can find a proper job as a real estate agent.

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,220
Killing two birds with one stone.

129
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,920
Can I hire someone to take the real estate agent exam for me?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
Of course.

131
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,440
How can I contact you?

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,480
The properties of these trigonometric functions

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,960
are based on monotonicity

134
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
and symmetry to determine the parameters.

135
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm not sure if my explanation

136
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,720
makes sense to you?

137
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,200
Also,

138
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,280
Guo Yang, come here for a moment.

139
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,560
Yingxi, wait a moment.

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,570
I'm in the middle of tutoring Chen Yingxi.

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,840
There's a math problem I can't explain clearly to her.

142
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
Aren't you better at math than me?

143
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Could you help me explain it to her?

144
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Sure.

145
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,960
Hurry up, we're in the middle of class.

146
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Coming.

147
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,400
Yingxi, this is Teacher Guo.

148
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,160
Hello, Yingxi.

149
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm Guo Yang.

150
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,650
Hello, teacher.

151
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,520
So,

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,840
where were you in the lesson with Yingxi?

153
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
What part is causing trouble?

154
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
I was just covering monotonicity

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,720
and finding parameters for symmetry.

156
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,640
Alright, Yingxi,

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,600
do you understand everything now?

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,320
I've got it.

159
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,440
That's good.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
So, Juan, do you need anything else?

161
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,440
No, I'm good.

162
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,240
Yingxi,

163
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,360
we'll end today's lesson here.

164
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,040
Thank you, teacher. Goodbye, teacher.

165
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,960
Okay, bye-bye,

166
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,080
bye-bye.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,660
Alright, get some rest early.

168
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Honey,

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
can you continue

170
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,810
tutoring Chen Yingxi tomorrow night?

171
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,280
Why?

172
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
Lately, whenever I teach,

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,520
I feel so much pressure,

174
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,600
like I can't even express myself clearly during class.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,640
Your communication skills are fine.

176
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,040
Are you just too nervous?

177
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,900
It's not really nervousness,

178
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,770
it's just when I explain something to her,

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,280
I feel like she never understands,

180
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,880
and gradually I've lost my confidence.

181
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,680
I think this job

182
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,610
is beyond me now.

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,250
I'm planning to resign to Zhuo Peng tomorrow.

184
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,680
But Chen Yingxi's case

185
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,720
is so important for Lizhong Study Abroad,

186
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,320
and I don't want to mess it up.

187
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Could you cover for me?

188
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,200
I...

189
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
How about this,

190
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,490
if I don't have to work overtime tomorrow,

191
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,330
I'll come back and help you out.

192
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,200
Thanks, honey.

193
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
I'll get back to my work then.

194
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll make you a cup of ginseng tea.

195
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,080
Guo Yang's teaching videos have the highest view count,

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,960
and the best likes, comments, and shares.

197
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,120
It seems having Guo Yang replace Liu Juan

198
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,160
as a registered teacher

199
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,560
would be the best choice.

200
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,120
He's already so popular during the beta testing phase.

201
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,650
When we officially launch,

202
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
students booking him will definitely be overwhelming.

203
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,080
Making Guo Yang the example for real clients

204
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,720
would be ideal.

205
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,800
That's what I was thinking too.

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
We should pair him with a suitable student.

207
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,520
I've already selected Su Li from the registered students.

208
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,600
What do you think?

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
I was just thinking of choosing her.

210
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,440
Really?

211
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,080
Great minds think alike.

212
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,640
Have some orange juice.

213
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,400
Thanks.

214
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
Guo Yang.

215
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Didn't sleep well again?

216
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
This is for Kerry.

217
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,000
Want me to deliver it for you?

218
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,320
No need, I can take it myself.

219
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,690
I offered because you look tired and pitiful,

220
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,140
and to spare you from feeling sick seeing Kerry.

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,640
It's not that bad.

222
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,490
Don't say I didn't warn you,

223
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,530
whatever you do, don't look at her face directly.

224
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,160
Excuse me.

225
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Come in.

226
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Kerry, here's this week's report.

227
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,480
Please take a look at it.

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,520
If everything looks good,

229
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,120
could you sign here, please?

230
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
It's okay, no rush.

231
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,600
Are you looking for a pen?

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,920
Next time you can leave the documents on my desk,

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,080
I'll sign them when I see them,

234
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,320
and have someone deliver them back to you.

235
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,320
That's all right,

236
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
I'll still bring them to you personally next time.

237
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,880
Come in, Xiao Xiang.

238
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll go get Ke'a.

239
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,920
Keke! Xiao Xiang is here.

240
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,410
Why are you standing there?

241
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
Thinking.

242
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,720
Thinking about what?

243
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
I'm thinking about the movie I'm taking you to see later,

244
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,410
and whether you'll like it.

245
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,660
We're going to see a movie?

246
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
Then I'll change my clothes,

247
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,420
wait for me.

248
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
Movie.

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,520
What movie are we seeing?

250
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,120
Senior, I won't join the team building tonight.

251
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,040
What's wrong?

252
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,800
Well,

253
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,460
I took on some freelance work,

254
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,040
and because of the time difference,

255
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,840
I can only use the evening hours.

256
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,160
What kind of freelance work?

257
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,080
I'm tutoring Chinese students who are studying abroad.

258
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,520
You see,

259
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,720
a friend of mine opened a study abroad consulting company,

260
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,680
and I'm responsible for a few students.

261
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,810
That's pretty good.

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
I hope your visa comes through soon.

263
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,400
You should follow up on it when you can,

264
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,480
otherwise in the future,

265
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,440
you might not even have the chance to earn extra money.

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,900
I know, I'm waiting for it.

267
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,200
Thanks, senior.

268
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,600
You're eating here too?

269
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Well,

270
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,520
I don't usually come to

271
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,320
crowded places like this to eat.

272
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,440
That's not what I meant.

273
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Isn't there a team-building event today?

274
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,700
I thought I was the only one who didn't go.

275
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,600
I'd rather skip the team building.

276
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
It wouldn't be appropriate for me to go.

277
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
Yeah, it's pretty boring.

278
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,240
Those fake brown-nosing gatherings,

279
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,640
I don't like them either.

280
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Really?

281
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,080
I always thought you were different from the others.

282
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,320
Not really.

283
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200
The burgers here are pretty mediocre.

284
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,520
Is this your first time at this place?

285
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,980
You picked the wrong spot.

286
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
My dad used to bring me here often when I was little,

287
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,320
but we stopped coming much after that.

288
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,770
So I come here occasionally for a bite,

289
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,200
just didn't expect to run into you here today.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
So things aren't good between you and your dad now?

291
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,440
No, it's just that he's too busy

292
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,320
to come here with me anymore.

293
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,800
I tend to be a bit blunt when I speak.

295
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,760
Hope I didn't offend you.

296
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
It's fine.

297
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,570
I'm actually enjoying our conversation.

298
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,920
So you won't be coming home for dinner anymore?

299
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
You could have told me earlier,

300
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I've made all this food for nothing.

301
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,560
I was too hungry today,

302
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,520
so I just grabbed a quick bite downstairs.

303
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,650
I'll let you know in advance next time.

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,780
I made some sweet soup. Want some?

305
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,680
No thanks, I'm too full.

306
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,480
Why does my eyelid keep twitching lately?

307
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,960
Which eye twitching means good luck, and which one means bad luck?

308
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,400
Left eye twitching means fortune, right eye means trouble.

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,200
Left eye twitching means fortune, right eye means trouble.

310
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm on the left.

311
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,280
Which of your eyes is twitching?

312
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,940
Both of my eyes are twitching.

313
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,160
Then you just didn't sleep well.

314
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not joking with you.

315
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Maybe it's because the lottery results are about to come out.

316
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm nervous.

317
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,240
What if...

318
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,770
Heaven always leaves a way out,

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,660
just take it one step at a time.

320
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,440
Your attitude is quite positive this time.

321
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,570
I'll go teach my students in China now.

322
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,320
Okay, I'll go edit those photos and upload the products.

323
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
Good luck!

324
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,720
You can do it!

325
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,320
Coming!

326
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,800
It's exploding!

327
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,520
There are way too many consultation requests,

328
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,000
they've crashed the Lizhong Study Abroad inbox,

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,760
and since it's linked to my email,

330
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,880
mine has crashed too.

331
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm done for! I can't handle all this!

332
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,600
Let me see.

333
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,240
Don't panic.

334
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,080
Here.

335
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
What are you doing?

336
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,080
The number of users is growing faster than expected,

337
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,720
we can't let the website crash.

338
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,920
Then let it crash!

339
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
If it crashes, all our problems will be over anyway.

340
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,720
What kind of talk is that?

341
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,650
Can't you handle a little problem?

342
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
Here's what we'll do.

343
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll write an email classification optimization for you,

344
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,440
appointments will be exported directly to spreadsheets,

345
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,400
inquiries will be listed separately,

346
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600
so they won't conflict with each other.

347
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,680
Come on, give me your computer.

348
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
Okay, here.

349
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,440
I'll reply to these then.

350
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
You start replying,

351
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,600
I'll write the code while you respond.

352
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,040
How's it going on your end?

353
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,720
It's going well too,

354
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
but the person responding

355
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,240
is overwhelmed with so many appointments,

356
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
they can't keep up at all.

357
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
That's a good thing.

358
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,040
Let's watch together, meteors fill the sky, make a wish

359
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,160
Even those who've seen it find it sweet

360
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,120
Let's play together, strings of love chords

361
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,400
Making everyone who hears feel so warm

362
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,600
I waited so long for you to appear

363
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,840
My world begins to fill with romance, turning pink

364
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
My world begins to fill with romance, turning all pink

365
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,080
Deeply in love with you, deeply in love with you

366
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,880
Only now do I believe

367
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,440
that love's sky

368
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,000
Love's sky changes with my mood

369
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,280
Sometimes clear, sometimes rain

370
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,000
Promises on stone walls, against time, slow down a bit

371
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,960
No matter how

372
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,360
far I go, I won't feel lonely

373
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,320
The taste of late summer, papaya and durian, just a bit

374
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,440
Saved until winter makes me miss it more

375
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Only when you appeared did I discover

376
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:08,000
My world finally settling, diamonds embedded

377
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,600
Deeply in love with me, deeply in love with me

378
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,160
Only now do I believe

379
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,080
Love's sky changes with my mood

380
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,640
How did I fall asleep?

381
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,120
It's okay,

382
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,160
I've finished writing the program,

383
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
from now on incoming emails will be automatically sorted,

384
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,220
it won't be so chaotic.

385
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,280
It's great to know programming,

386
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,740
technology really frees us from hard labor.

387
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,440
Well, I'll be going now.

388
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,320
It's no trouble. Let me walk you out.

389
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,280
No need, really.

390
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,440
Teacher Zhuo, you've been up all night.

391
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,480
You should get some rest soon.

392
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,560
I'm off. Bye!

393
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,970
Goodbye, Teacher Zhuo.

394
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,040
Lin Yao.

395
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,280
It's been a while.

396
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,200
Seven months.

397
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,220
Congratulations.

398
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,600
You didn't come by yourself?

399
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,520
What else?

400
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,800
What if something happens to you with that big belly?

401
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,730
Please sit down,

402
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,920
come on.

403
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,640
You sit down.

404
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
My goodness, look at you.

405
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,480
What is it?

406
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,160
Why did you suddenly come to see me?

407
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,220
I've missed you. Just came to see you.

408
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm actually thinking about buying a house here.

409
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,420
Have you found anything you like?

410
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,380
Aren't you going to ask me why?

411
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,280
No need to ask.

412
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,200
You must have your own reasons.

413
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
I've made an appointment with a real estate agent

414
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,330
to view some properties. Come with me?

415
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
Sure.

416
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,760
Take it easy.

417
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,880
Careful.

418
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,640
So why did you decide

419
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,480
to buy a place near Saint Helen?

420
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,690
What do you think about me coming back for a master's degree?

421
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
You think it's a bad idea too, right?

422
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,080
You're actually considering studying again at this point?

423
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,400
Actually, I'm thinking that

424
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
more and more Chinese students will be coming here to study in the future.

425
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,560
So whether I rent it out

426
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,960
or sell it later, it'll be in high demand.

427
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,530
That's smart thinking.

428
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
My agent is here.

429
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
Miss Lin, I'm so sorry

430
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,040
for keeping you waiting.

431
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,000
Jessica.

432
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Zhuo Peng.

433
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,890
You two know each other?

434
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,800
Yes, his father and I are friends.

435
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,480
So you know Mr. Zhuo too?

436
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,760
That's great!

437
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,820
I'll call you Jessica from now on too.

438
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,740
Please take good care of the housing matter.

439
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,080
Of course,

440
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,880
Miss Lin, I'll show you several options

441
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,000
so you can make a good choice.

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,130
Alright, let's look at this one first.

443
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,720
So she's that Lin Yao you mentioned.

444
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,170
Seems my dad really tells you everything.

445
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,360
Please come in.

446
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,760
Come, Nian.

447
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,320
Thank you.

448
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
What happened to your hand?

449
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,040
It's nothing, just a scrape.

450
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,960
By the way, Jian,

451
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
how are Guo Yang's tutoring sessions with Su Li going?

452
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
He's taking it very seriously.

453
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,520
Since you wanted to use his tutoring sessions with Su Li

454
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,200
as an advertisement for Lizhong Study Abroad,

455
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,520
he's really putting in the effort.

456
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,160
Every time he finishes a lesson,

457
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,000
he immediately takes the recorded video

458
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,720
and edits it right away,

459
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,560
even adding lots of fun special effects.

460
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,720
That's impressive.

461
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
He's working so hard.

462
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,120
Well, this Su Li

463
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,400
is the first test client

464
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,720
on our new Lizhong Study Abroad platform,

465
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,080
so these video materials are extremely important.

466
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
Guo Yang deserves credit for his hard work,

467
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
especially since he's such a good teacher.

468
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,920
Actually,

469
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,800
he's under a lot of pressure at work lately.

470
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,720
His company has given everyone

471
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
new performance targets.

472
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,680
After finishing the tutoring sessions, he still has to work overtime,

473
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,960
often working until 2 or 3 in the morning without getting any sleep.

474
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,160
That's really tough.

475
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,920
Guo Yang and I have been a bit tight on money lately, haven't we?

476
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,850
Fortunately, I used my credit card

477
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,360
to pay for the new academic year's tuition in installments.

478
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,440
And there are even discounts for installment plans right now.

479
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,680
Zhuo Peng probably considered our situation

480
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,600
and assigned him more students

481
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,440
so we could earn more teaching fees.

482
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,280
More work, more pay, right?

483
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,960
Right.

484
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,640
Especially for Su Li's course,

485
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,560
probably because it's going to be used for advertising,

486
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,290
the hourly rate is even higher.

487
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,320
Wasn't she supposed to get free tutoring?

488
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,720
Since she's a test client,

489
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,520
there shouldn't be any charges.

490
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
But Zhuo Peng has been paying us

491
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,860
the deposit from the very beginning,

492
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,600
and he's been consistently paying

493
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
for all the subsequent lessons.

494
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,200
I see.

495
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,720
So Zhuo Peng knows about our financial difficulties.

496
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
voluntarily covered this expense.

497
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,210
What are you smiling at?

498
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,440
Nothing.

499
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
Dad really has good taste.

500
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,440
I bet before I get home,

501
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,840
my dad will already know about you buying a house in Seattle.

502
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Out of those four houses we saw today,

503
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
which one do you like best?

504
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,680
Why are you asking me?

505
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,960
What you like is what matters most.

506
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,760
I just want to hear your opinion.

507
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,120
Okay.

508
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,040
The first house has the largest yard,

509
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,440
with the most land area.

510
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,280
But it's an east-west oriented house,

511
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,560
and according to Chinese customs,

512
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
north-south oriented houses are better.

513
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,240
The second one has a more practical layout,

514
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,680
but it's a bit older.

515
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,720
The owner said they can leave the furniture,

516
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,880
which are all quality pieces.

517
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,740
Vintage style,

518
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,280
which is probably more to my taste.

519
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,600
You'd probably find it too old-fashioned.

520
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,000
What about the third one?

521
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,800
The third one is the newest,

522
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,560
with a more modern design.

523
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,920
But that narrow bedroom feels really awkward to me.

524
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,760
I find it really awkward too.

525
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,760
The fourth option is good

526
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,040
it combines many of the advantages mentioned

527
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,120
just that the neighborhood isn't great.

528
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,380
I knew you'd like the second option best.

529
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,520
What does it matter what I like?

530
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
It's your decision to buy the house.

531
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,000
This... this is completely unwatchable.

532
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,000
Really.

533
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,840
Challenge failed.

534
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,240
How could I possibly give this as a gift?

535
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
It's quite warm.

536
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,040
Hello, Yingxi?

537
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,000
What? You're in America now?

538
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,840
Really? Where are you now?

539
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,280
How about this, send me your location

540
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,540
and I'll come find you.

541
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
Yingxi.

542
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,060
Sister Gu Nian.

543
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,650
I've missed you so much.

544
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
I've been so busy

545
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
that I completely forgot you were coming to America.

546
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,920
The exchange program has already started.

547
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,280
I was afraid of disturbing your studies,

548
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,920
so I didn't tell you in advance.

549
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,760
I wanted to get settled first and then surprise you.

550
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,360
Congratulations on making it to America,

551
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,800
but what exactly are you doing here?

552
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,800
The owner asked me to sell all the useless secondhand items

553
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,360
at a discount.

554
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,720
Sis, your Lizhong Study Abroad is really popular now.

555
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,800
Many of my classmates back home know about you guys.

556
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,640
Really?

557
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,740
That's great. Excellent.

558
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,680
Nancy, what are you talking about?

559
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,540
Is someone here to buy something?

560
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,760
It's my friend. She just came to look around.

561
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
Who is it?

562
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,700
Debbie, the owner of GARD.

563
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,260
Does she always talk to you like that?

564
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,880
That's probably just her personality.

565
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,680
Don't worry.

566
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Yingxi, if you encounter any difficulties,

567
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,490
you can contact me anytime.

568
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
How is Brother Zhuo Peng doing?

569
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,880
I should find time to visit him.

570
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,040
You've all been so good to me,

571
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,800
I don't know how to thank you enough.

572
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,760
That's right. When I first applied to St. Helen's,

573
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,480
he was a huge help to me too.

574
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,560
And you know what?

575
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Lizhong Study Abroad has made an amazing comeback.

576
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,840
It's doing so well now.

577
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,130
Teacher Zhuo has put in so much effort.

578
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,480
And he's not doing it just for profit.

579
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,760
He even helps students who are in financial difficulty

580
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,200
by advancing their tuition fees.

581
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,330
That's really rare.

582
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,080
Sister Gu Nian, what does Brother Zhuo Peng like?

583
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,340
I should buy him a gift.

584
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,450
Yes, we should definitely get him a nice gift.

585
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,920
This lamp is nice. How much is it?

586
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
Consider it your first sale.

587
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,490
You want to buy the lamp?

588
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
What a beautiful lamp.

589
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,280
But she was here first.

590
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,160
Are you Gu Nian?

591
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
You know me?

592
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,840
Of course.

593
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,490
Betty's love rival.

594
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,680
Do you always have to compete with others for everything?

595
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,720
Fine, you can have it.

596
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
She's so strange.

597
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,560
Nian Nian.

598
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
Are you really buying a lamp?

599
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,400
Buying a lamp for Teacher Zhuo.

600
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,360
If there are no issues with the contract,

601
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,200
please sign here. Here you go.

602
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,280
I don't need to read it.

603
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,080
It's fine if you've reviewed it.

604
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,440
Sign here.

605
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,280
I...

606
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,960
Why?

607
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,720
This house is for you.

608
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,920
What? Why would you buy me a house?

609
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,480
Can't I give you a gift?

610
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,740
I can't accept such an extravagant gift.

611
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
Hurry up. Jessica is waiting.

612
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm not in a hurry.

613
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,240
But...

614
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,000
What's going on between you two?

615
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,760
Jessica, could you

616
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,290
let me talk to Lin Yao alone?

617
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,200
Okay.

618
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,360
Lin Yao, what exactly are you trying to do?

619
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,440
Buying a house.

620
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,130
But this house must be in your name.

621
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,960
Why? Give me a reason.

622
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Zhuo Peng,

623
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,020
you were always good to me when we were together,

624
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,770
I know you don't need me to repay anything,

625
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,840
but you did sacrifice for me

626
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,760
by putting your studies and ambitions on hold.

627
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,440
Call it care or compensation,

628
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,500
I really want to do something for you.

629
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,320
Lin Yao, when you left back then

630
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,040
I didn't take your money,

631
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
and I absolutely won't take your house now either.

632
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,680
Just think of it as keeping it for me.

633
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,740
I'm sorry, Lin Yao,

634
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,080
you should know my personality better than anyone.

635
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,080
Honey,

636
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,719
you just flew to Seattle

637
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,080
without saying a word.

638
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,520
You're pregnant,

639
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,800
what if something happened,

640
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,520
wouldn't you have scared me to death?

641
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,380
What could possibly happen to me?

642
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,290
I just came out to clear my head.

643
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,480
You're never home,

644
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,480
what's the point of me staying alone in an empty house?

645
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,280
Darling, about that party last time,

646
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,520
it wasn't that I didn't want to bring you,

647
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,120
the invitation specifically stated

648
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,440
no women allowed,

649
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,600
it was strictly a men's gathering.

650
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,260
Then why did you only come home the next morning?

651
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,719
You know how Lao Xu is,

652
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,040
he drinks endlessly.

653
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,960
I told him

654
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,360
you were waiting for me at home,

655
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,219
but he just wouldn't let me leave.

656
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,880
Darling, I have been a bit busy lately,

657
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,239
and haven't given you enough attention,

658
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,320
but all this running around

659
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,800
is for our family,

660
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,240
for our baby.

661
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,960
Come on, don't be angry anymore, okay?

662
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,080
Me flying here this time,

663
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,610
isn't that sincere enough?

664
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,080
So you're done with work now?

665
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,280
All done,

666
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
I flew here specifically to be with you.

667
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,840
If you want to go out,

668
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,240
or stay home eating popcorn and watching movies,

669
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,040
I'll do whatever you want, okay?

670
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,890
Go change your clothes,

671
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,410
I'll take you for a drive

672
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,860
and we can grab something nice to eat.

673
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,010
That's more like it.

674
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,520
Alright, go on,

675
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,640
go change.

676
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,160
Hello.

677
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,160
Miss Lin, if Zhuo Peng won't sign,

678
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,930
do you still want the house?

679
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,760
Yes,

680
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,160
put it in my name,

681
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,080
I'll sign.

682
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,040
Alright.

683
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,400
Good.

684
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,240
Great.

685
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,600
Honey, how's this one?

686
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,340
Okay, I'll get there as soon as possible.

687
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,200
Honey, I need to go to Beijing right away.

688
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,200
Why so sudden?

689
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,200
The spring auction is about to begin.

690
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,960
There are some major collectors there

691
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,880
who insist that before the auction starts,

692
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,600
they need to meet with me for a discussion.

693
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,840
In such a hurry?

694
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,000
I have no choice.

695
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,760
But after I return this time,

696
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,920
I'll stay with you and won't go anywhere,

697
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,050
until after you've given birth, okay?

698
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,050
How long will you be gone this time?

699
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,080
About two weeks.

700
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,320
Two weeks, not a day more.

701
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,800
Okay, whatever you say.

702
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,850
I'll come back as soon as possible.

703
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,010
Call me when you get to Beijing.

704
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,200
I will.

705
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,840
Why won't you accept it?

706
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,440
It's a whole apartment, man!

707
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,680
Let me explain this to you.

708
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,160
Didn't you give your youth to Lin Yao?

709
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,800
Now she wants to compensate you,

710
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,280
she's offering you an apartment,

711
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,040
why won't you take it?

712
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,260
It's driving me crazy!

713
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,360
I bet if it were you,

714
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,520
you'd sign on the spot,

715
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,960
of course.

716
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,290
I would never refuse someone's kindness.

717
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,800
Let me tell you,

718
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,320
I just need an ex-girlfriend like Lin Yao,

719
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,960
you know?

720
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,880
All I have is that troublemaker Ma Xiaoyun,

721
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,680
I don't even want to mention her.

722
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,970
If I had such a wealthy ex-girlfriend,

723
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,480
I'd take anything she offered me.

724
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,080
Right?

725
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,400
Professor Zhuo,

726
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,680
will you be at school tomorrow?

727
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,160
I want to give you a gift.

728
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,000
What's wrong?

729
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,010
No, it's just that Gu Nian says she wants to give me a gift.

730
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,570
Is there any holiday coming up?

731
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,720
No.

732
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,170
It's almost Qingming Festival back home.

733
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,680
Why is everyone so eager to give me gifts?

734
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,400
Strange.

735
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,000
You know, if Gu Nian wants to give you a gift,

736
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
could she be trying to confess her feelings to you?

737
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,660
Why isn't anyone giving me gifts?

738
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,560
I'll be there. See you tomorrow.

739
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,840
Here, one more copy.

740
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,520
Okay.

741
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
That's done.

742
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,200
Good, this will do.

743
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
You keep this copy.

744
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,160
Sure.

745
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,720
Pleasure doing business with you.

746
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,780
Sorry about what happened last time.

747
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,760
It's nothing.

748
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,200
You're already the fastest decision-maker

749
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,760
I've ever had as a client.

750
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,360
Good houses are like good men,

751
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,320
when you find one you like, grab it quickly, right?

752
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,840
Good houses deserve good women,

753
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,720
good women deserve good men,

754
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,920
makes perfect sense.

755
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,200
Do you like the vintage style?

756
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,890
Is this the gift you said you'd give me?

757
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,280
This one?

758
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,120
It's a joint gift from Chen Yingxi and me to Professor Zhuo,

759
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,440
to express our gratitude to you.

760
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,520
Chen Yingxi?

761
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,560
Isn't she in America now?

762
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,600
I should find time to visit her.

763
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,760
Don't you like the lamp?

764
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,360
No, I... I just thought...

765
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,000
The lamp is really nice. I really like it.

766
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,600
Look at this... this design.

767
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,780
The design is quite unique, isn't it?

768
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,680
Chen Yingxi was helping her

769
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,080
host family sell second-hand items,

770
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,000
and I bought it for 30 dollars.

771
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,840
I just find this lamp really practical,

772
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,760
just like that chair you gave me,

773
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,200
which is so comfortable to sit in.

774
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,640
Alright, thank you.

775
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,840
Thank you for your gift.

776
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
I'm just glad you like it, Professor Zhuo.

777
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,880
I'll be going now.

778
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,680
Okay.

779
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,560
Bye-bye.

780
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,080
Lin Yao,

781
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,480
you're moving out today?

782
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,640
Okay, wait for me.

783
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,680
Come with me,

784
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,560
let's go to the back.

785
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm busy.

786
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,600
Alright, I have good news for you.

787
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,320
What good news?

788
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,120
You passed your real estate agent license exam.

789
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,840
When did I take that exam?

790
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,560
You don't need to take the exam in person,

791
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,320
just wait a few days to get your license.

792
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,600
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

793
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,520
It means you

794
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,080
are now

795
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,440
a certified real estate agent.

796
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

797
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,760
I don't want some dubious license.

798
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,680
I'm still busy here.

799
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,160
Stop messing around.

800
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,820
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

801
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,840
I'll find someone to take the exam for you.

802
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,640
A substitute.

803
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,480
Are you crazy?

804
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,000
We'll both go to jail,

805
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,320
and be ruined together.

806
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,800
What are you thinking?

807
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,080
I just want you to have a better life.

808
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,880
You want me to have a better life?

809
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,520
Is this really what you call helping me?

810
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,240
If I don't accept your 'kindness,'

811
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,840
then I'm the ungrateful one?

812
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,920
Aren't you just concerned about how

813
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,280
you get this certificate?

814
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,760
We can't let a piece of paper keep us out, right?

815
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,520
If I can't even pass this exam,

816
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,380
what right do I have to be an agent?

817
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
All the certificates in this world

818
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,280
are just formalities.

819
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,600
Does your dad have a chef certificate?

820
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,120
He's still a chef anyway, right?

821
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,640
Proving qualifications...

822
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,370
A certificate isn't the only measure of ability.

823
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,360
Together,

824
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,120
watching shooting stars together, making wishes.

825
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:49,920
Even those who've seen it

826
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,600
find it sweet.

827
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,240
Together,

828
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,240
our heartstrings.

829
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,200
Making everyone who hears

830
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,400
feel so warm inside.

831
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,200
I've waited so long for you to appear.

832
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,520
Beginning to bloom.

833
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,480
My world starts to fill

834
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,840
with romance, turning pink all over.

835
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,840
Until this moment.

836
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,600
The sky of love changes with my mood.

837
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:33,800
Sometimes clear,

838
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,880
sometimes rainy.

839
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,680
The promise between us.

840
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,000
The promise on the stone wall,

841
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,040
defying time, slowing down a bit.

842
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,400
No matter how far.

843
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,520
No matter how far we go,

844
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,920
it won't feel romantic without you.

845
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,600
Canada Office Production Assistant

846
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,160
The taste of

847
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,040
The taste of late summer,

848
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,100
papaya and durian, just a little bit.

849
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:17,760
Saved until winter,

850
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,160
the longing grows stronger.

851
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,640
Waiting for you to appear.

852
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:27,760
My world finally

853
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,840
settles with diamond inlays.

854
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,560
Only now do I believe.

855
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:42,640
The sky of love changes

856
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,760
with my emotions.

857
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,440
Sometimes clear,

858
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,960
sometimes rainy.
