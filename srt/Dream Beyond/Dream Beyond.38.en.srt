1
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,039
At first I thought

2
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,280
they didn't care about me at all and were ignoring me,

3
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
but it turns out they were deeply moved

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,920
and kept me there talking non-stop.

5
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
These are all the notes I took down,

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,320
take a look.

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,920
My cousin says it's hard to find a job after graduation.

8
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,640
My car broke down again.

9
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,800
My survival skills are lacking.

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,400
So I think these are

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,280
what people really need.

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,520
We don't need to look far,

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,800
just look at the graduates around us,

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
do they really care about

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,320
wine tasting, shopping, and having fun after graduation?

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,080
Not at all.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,610
What they care more about is

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,320
what survival skills they have

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,180
and what kind of job they can find.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,720
Looks like you've finally found your strength,

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,250
practicality and empathy.

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,240
I have one more week for the campaign

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,970
during which I need to give my first formal speech

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,130
followed by the school-wide vote.

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
For my first speech, the theme will be

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,760
'Focus on Individuals, Listen to Hearts'

27
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
what do you think?

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,160
Sounds pretty good

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,320
but honestly

30
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,720
isn't the poster a bit plain?

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,380
There's no time or location for the first round.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,079
Well, I was thinking

33
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,560
rather than letting everyone know the time and place

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
it's better to make them remember me first

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,440
so I made my name huge on the poster

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,600
that's my strategy.

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,920
Looks like you've thought this through better than I have.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,380
You're making me blush with all this praise.

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,720
Oh, by the way, I need to tell you something

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,440
Mo Xiaorui's mother called me

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
she told me that Xiaorui has been

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
doing really well with his studies lately.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
Really?

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
We've changed so many tutors for him before

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,080
and he never improved.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,320
Isn't that strange?

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,320
So I'm still a bit concerned

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,650
and want to check on him. What do you think?

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,079
You're asking me?

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes, I want your opinion.

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,040
It's normal to care about Lizhong Study Abroad's former clients

52
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,160
I don't have any objections.

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,640
Do you want to come with me?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
I'd like to go too

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,680
but I need to do my homework

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,360
I haven't finished my previous assignments

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,520
and I even fell asleep in class.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,120
Campaigning and attending classes at the same time is really tough.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Don't work so hard.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Look,

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,200
maybe you should stop looking.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,960
How could I do that?

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
I can't just give up halfway.

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,880
Alright, whatever decision you make,

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll fully support whatever you want to do.

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,600
Is this what people call

67
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,040
love is blind?

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,200
Xiaorui, someone's here for you.

70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,560
Who is it?

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
See for yourself.

72
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,240
Brother Zhuopeng,

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,159
perfect timing! Join us.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,200
No thanks,

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,480
your mom told me your grades have been excellent lately,

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,810
so I came to check on you.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,600
The new Lizhong Study Abroad Agency is great,

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,400
they've assigned us really good teachers

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
who are very focused on our needs.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
That's good.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Come on!

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,440
You should be well aware that in America, anyone under 21

83
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,760
is not allowed to drink alcohol. It's illegal.

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,960
What's going on here?

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,440
I didn't drink. It was all them.

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Come on, show me your driver's license.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
One for each of you, courtesy of yours truly.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,080
One for everyone, a gift from me.

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Here they are!

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,370
Teacher, please have a seat anywhere.

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
Let me see, what's all this about?

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Don't mess with those, alright?

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
Let me find mine. This photo looks so ugly.

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,560
Look at your photo, then look at mine.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,440
Where did those fake driver's licenses come from?

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
What's it to you?

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,880
You've had quite a bit to drink,

98
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,280
call your parents right away

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,360
to take you home.

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
Parents?

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Ivy.

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm at my class reunion,

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,000
I've got everything ready.

104
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Bye.

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,200
Xiang Nongchao, what are you doing here?

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
I was summoned here.

107
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
By He Bin.

108
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
By the way, congratulations

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
on becoming a mother.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,520
I haven't found time to visit you,

111
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
don't be mad at me.

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,440
Everything's fine,

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,700
no need to be so formal.

114
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,920
What did He Bin want with you?

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Our previous policy at Lizhong Education

116
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
was always to teach according to students' abilities,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,680
meaning if a student's qualifications

118
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
didn't meet American university standards,

119
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,010
we would reject them outright.

120
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,800
But after the acquisition, things changed.

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,200
Now regardless of students' abilities,

122
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
they accept everyone

123
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,680
and persuade them to keep trying.

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
I didn't follow this new rule

125
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,600
and advised some Chinese students to withdraw,

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
so I was called in.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,260
How could this happen?

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
You don't know yet?

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
I just started working here,

130
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
there's a lot I'm not familiar with.

131
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,720
Lin Yao,

132
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,200
you're our company's new CEO,

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
and as a friend,

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,130
I feel I should give you a heads-up.

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,560
The company can't continue like this,

136
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,490
there'll be trouble down the road.

137
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,440
I understand,

138
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,180
I'll look into it thoroughly.

139
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Alright then, good luck.

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm taking this opportunity to resign.

141
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
I won't be working as a counselor anymore.

142
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,920
You're quitting? Just because of different teaching philosophies?

143
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,680
No, it's my own issue.

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,040
I'll explain more later.

145
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
I need to go now, bye.

146
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,960
Bye.

147
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
Good luck.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,280
Come in.

149
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,560
Mr. He.

150
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,960
Mr. Lin, what can I do for you?

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,650
You're too kind.

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,920
I've been looking at

153
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,840
the company's past data and cases,

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,720
and I have some new ideas

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,120
and suggestions for the company's development

156
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,980
that I'd like to discuss with you.

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
What new ideas do you have?

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,320
I suggest we establish

159
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,960
several international departments across Asia,

160
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,480
such as in Korea, Japan, and India,

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
where we could expand our operations

162
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
beyond just Chinese international students.

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,480
No, no, no. That won't be necessary,

164
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,680
you don't need to do anything right now.

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,280
Is there anything else?

166
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,760
No, that's all.

167
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,040
Then you can go back to work.

168
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,440
I have a meeting shortly.

169
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,760
Okay.

170
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,840
These materials are the results

171
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,160
of my years of research and statistics on Chinese students.

172
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,600
They clearly prove

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,080
that some Chinese students

174
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
have issues during exams.

175
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
We have been overlooking

176
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,520
these problems in our admission process.

177
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,840
This is urgent, as the new academic year is approaching.

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
I suggest we develop

179
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
new admission policies for Chinese students,

180
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
increasing both difficulty and scrutiny.

181
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
This matter is extremely important,

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,520
we need to come up with a solution as soon as possible.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,720
This is a major decision,

184
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,280
I think this matter needs further discussion.

185
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
I agree.

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,960
We can first establish a special task force

187
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
to conduct research

188
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,680
and get to the bottom of this.

189
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Of course, we'll put it to a vote in the end.

190
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,000
Before that,

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,200
we should issue a notice to the students.

192
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,720
Social practice experience.

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,920
TOEFL section scores - Speaking.

194
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,960
Did Chinese students offend the school somehow?

195
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,080
Every score requirement has been raised so high.

196
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,520
Good thing we've already taken the test,

197
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,850
otherwise we'd be screwed by this policy.

198
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
This vice president looks so kind and gentle,

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
but he's actually quite ruthless.

200
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,880
It does sound pretty absurd.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Where there's a policy, there's a workaround.

202
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,920
By next year's admissions,

203
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
there will definitely be new test-taking strategies.

204
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Students back home are really something else.

205
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,640
I actually think there's no need to worry,

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
this new school policy won't pass the vote anyway.

207
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,040
I wouldn't be so sure,

208
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,280
it was proposed by the vice president himself.

209
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,120
It doesn't matter who proposed it.

210
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,440
The key issue is that this policy is completely unfair,

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,970
how could it possibly pass?

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
That's true.

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
It's just a public notice for now.

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,520
Alright, let's get to class.

215
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,010
Why are you staring at me like that?

216
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,540
How long have you been freeloading here?

217
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,780
Just over a month, I guess.

218
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,130
So what are your plans, you two?

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,480
What do you mean?

220
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,800
You should propose if that's what's next, get married if that's where you're at,

221
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,330
and just get on with whatever needs to be done.

222
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,000
You think I don't want to?

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,600
I've dropped hints so many times.

224
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,200
But Betty...

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
It's so hard.

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,720
Zhuopeng, Uncle, Auntie,

227
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,050
come quick and see this!

228
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,800
What's wrong? What's wrong?

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Is Betty bullying you again?

230
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,320
No,

231
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,160
Betty is playing guitar. It sounds amazing,

232
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,890
I want all of you to come listen.

233
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,800
I thought something serious had happened.

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
No, please come upstairs and see.

235
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
Betty has real musical talent.

236
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Sure.

237
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,960
Betty,

238
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,760
could you play that piece again?

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,840
Could you knock on the door?

240
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,400
Come in.

241
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,690
Don't put it away. I haven't heard enough yet.

242
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,920
No.

243
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,800
Zhuopeng, please ask Betty to play another one.

244
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,160
It's really beautiful.

245
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
Don't touch my guitar.

246
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,880
I won't break it.

247
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,520
I used to play guitar too,

248
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm just tuning it for you.

249
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
There, all tuned.

250
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Try it.

251
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,640
Zhuopeng, look

252
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,480
isn't it great?

253
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,280
And it's Betty's original work.

254
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,040
If you don't like it, just don't say anything.

255
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
No, no, it's really good,

256
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
honestly, I'm quite impressed.

257
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,040
The melody is simple but sounds really nice and pleasant.

258
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,170
Betty, you truly have musical talent.

259
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,040
You don't need to comfort me,

260
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
I know my own level.

261
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm not just comforting you,

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,880
it really sounds great, I'm not lying.

263
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
I told you it's really beautiful.

264
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
And I think

265
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,360
if only we get to hear it,

266
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,440
it's such a waste.

267
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,880
You really think it sounds good?

268
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,720
Then I'll play some more.

269
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Great.

270
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,680
What?

271
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,880
Still up so late?

272
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,080
Gu Nian, have you seen that news?

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
It can't be true, right?

274
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,480
What news?

275
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Saint Helen University is planning to implement

276
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,530
a new policy targeting Chinese students.

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,920
I thought it was something else.

278
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,880
I know about it.

279
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,840
It's an internal university initiative.

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
How did you find out?

281
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,720
Our international student chat group is blowing up,

282
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,920
with all kinds of rumors flying around.

283
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,240
Gu Nian, what should we do?

284
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm telling you, don't panic now.

285
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,280
If the university implements a new policy,

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,920
they can't just make decisions on a whim.

287
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
It still needs careful consideration.

288
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,800
And ultimately, it will come to a vote.

289
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,640
If the proposal is unreasonable,

290
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
it could very well be rejected.

291
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,040
So please don't scare yourself.

292
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,760
What do you think? Will it pass?

293
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,800
It won't pass.

294
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Okay, good night, Gu Nian.

295
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
The school administration has carefully considered this

296
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,000
before agreeing to put the proposal into the review process.

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,240
Raising the score threshold isn't because

298
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
Chinese students perform well,

299
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,600
but because of some recent scandals.

300
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,000
These scandals have affected the admission standards,

301
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,840
which could be seen as unfair to students from other countries.

302
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,600
So if the school approves this proposal,

303
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,920
what will happen?

304
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,000
Currently this is just an internal matter,

305
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
but if the committee approves this plan,

306
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
it will be submitted to the state government.

307
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
Then it will be implemented.

308
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
Yes, I believe so.

309
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,960
Do you know?

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,480
In the new policy,

311
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,840
not only have they raised the standards

312
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,720
for TOEFL scores and social practice experience,

313
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
but they've also set specific thresholds.

314
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,960
But students from other countries

315
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,520
only need to pass the total score.

316
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,160
They've made strict requirements

317
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,520
specifically for Chinese students' spoken English.

318
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
This clearly targets Chinese students

319
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,000
who aren't comfortable speaking English.

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
If this isn't blatant discrimination,

321
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,360
then what is it?

322
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,240
Give me some reaction here.

323
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,880
Why are you just accepting this so easily?

324
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
What else can we do?

325
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,400
The Vice Principal has prepared thoroughly with solid arguments.

326
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,360
I also heard from Professor Chris that

327
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,400
the professors involved in the decision are quite supportive.

328
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,760
So you've had insider information all along,

329
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,420
why didn't you tell me sooner?

330
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,960
Yes, spoken English is indeed

331
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,600
a weakness for Chinese international students.

332
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,560
We should improve ourselves,

333
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,760
but that's not the real issue here.

334
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,200
Those international students from non-English speaking countries

335
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
have the same problem too.

336
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
So what bothers me isn't raising the standards,

337
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,300
but the blatant discrimination.

338
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,770
What else did Professor Chris say?

339
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,440
I don't know anything else,

340
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,369
but I heard him say there's a good chance it will pass.

341
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,240
And if it passes,

342
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,700
they plan to implement this policy starting this year.

343
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,599
This year?

344
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,400
They should at least wait until next year,

345
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,560
to give everyone a chance to prepare.

346
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,880
The students applying this year

347
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,360
have no idea the school is pulling this stunt,

348
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,920
it will catch them completely off guard,

349
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,780
with no time to prepare anything.

350
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,720
Yes,

351
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,280
this will have a significant impact

352
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,960
on this year's exam candidates.

353
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,120
What grounds does this vice principal have

354
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,960
to target Chinese students like this?

355
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,840
This is clearly a very unfair policy.

356
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,970
How could it possibly be implemented?

357
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,240
Gu Nian,

358
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,100
if you really want to change the school's decision,

359
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,680
I do have a way.

360
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,640
What's your idea?

361
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,040
It might not work though.

362
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,040
But every year, school policy decisions

363
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
include student representatives.

364
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
The grade's student council president

365
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,360
is eligible to vote on behalf of students.

366
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
So you're saying

367
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,280
if I successfully run

368
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,680
and become the student council president,

369
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
I can vote against it?

370
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,290
Against the vice principal's extreme decision.

371
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,280
That's right.

372
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
That's great!

373
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600
I never thought my spontaneous decision

374
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
would come in so handy.

375
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go.

376
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,040
Wait, where are you going?

377
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,900
To do homework.

378
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,800
How can you run for election properly without finishing your homework?

379
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
That homework presentation was really excellent,

380
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,480
Gu Nian.

381
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,080
Looks like the academic star Gu Nian is returning to class again.

382
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
Remember what you told me before?

383
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,240
That you had absolutely no interest in campus activities,

384
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,640
turns out it was all lies.

385
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,280
What I never expected was

386
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,520
that the person competing against me until the end

387
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,780
would actually be you.

388
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,600
First of all, I'm not trying to compete with you.

389
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,680
With your connections, you must have seen

390
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,320
the new school policy proposed by the Vice Principal.

391
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,400
If that really happens,

392
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
it will make things even harder for Chinese students.

393
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
Enough, enough.

394
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,560
I don't know why you're getting so worked up.

395
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,040
I just want to say that we're both Chinese,

396
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,160
and no matter who wins the election,

397
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,640
we need to vote against this policy.

398
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,600
We need to speak up for Chinese students

399
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,920
and convince others.

400
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,400
Fine, then just lose to me,

401
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,260
and I'll cast that opposing vote.

402
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,520
There's no change at all?

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,760
The last three

404
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,520
opinion polls show no significant growth.

405
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,360
Didn't I tell you to prepare gift packages

406
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,640
to distribute at school?

407
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,440
And weren't the opinion leaders

408
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,920
in each club given extra gifts?

409
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,080
Did you actually deliver them or not?

410
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
We did.

411
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,680
Then why is our approval rating still the same?

412
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
That method doesn't work anymore.

413
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
Also,

414
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,320
they probably don't buy

415
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,760
our campaign slogan.

416
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,920
Not buying it.

417
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,200
Liu Juan, how have you been lately?

418
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,680
Just get to the point.

419
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,440
Well, I'm planning to go back to China soon.

420
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,680
My mom wants me to bring Kerry

421
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,040
back home to meet her.

422
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,840
I haven't been back for several years.

423
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,960
And my dad's health isn't very...

424
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,600
What does this have to do with me?

425
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
Don't get me wrong.

426
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,640
I just wanted to say

427
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,700
I still have some stuff at your place.

428
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,280
I want to take it back with me this time.

429
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,840
It's that box I brought from home

430
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,440
when I first came to America.

431
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
There are some old photos and books inside.

432
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,440
So, I was wondering if you're home.

433
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,560
If you are,

434
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,360
would it be okay for me to come pick it up?

435
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,000
Want to get back at him?

436
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,120
Hello?

437
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,850
Hello? Liu Juan, are you there?

438
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,840
I got it.

439
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,720
Come over.

440
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm home.

441
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
Great.

442
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,050
I've made up my mind.

443
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,680
Promise me

444
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,960
that this stays between us.

445
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,080
Don't worry.

446
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,760
Take it.

447
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,000
Is that all?

448
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,520
It's enough to put him in jail for years.

449
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,480
Where's what I asked for?

450
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,100
All of Gu Nian's information is here.

451
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,220
Everything I know is in there.

452
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
Impressive. This Gu Nian

453
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
has been quite busy.

454
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,250
If you want to read it, take it home.

455
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,740
Guo Yang will be here soon.

456
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,360
Okay.

457
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,520
Good luck.

458
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,610
Have you set a date for returning home?

459
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,480
Give this jade pendant back to your mother.

460
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,840
Why?

461
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,600
She gave this to me because

462
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
she saw me as her future daughter-in-law.

463
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,210
It's not appropriate for me to keep it now.

464
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Keep it.

465
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Once a gift is given, there's no reason to take it back.

466
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,920
Her hands often crack.

467
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,620
Remember to remind her to use hand cream.

468
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,520
Thank you.

469
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,560
Juan.

470
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,160
You'll definitely find a good man someday.

471
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
I once thought you were that man,

472
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,760
but I was wrong.

473
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,880
Juan.

474
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,760
I owe you for today,

475
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,290
and I'll make it up to you double in the future.

476
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,100
You don't owe me anything.

477
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,080
You want a green card, and she can give you that.

478
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,540
You have every right to pursue what you want.

479
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,880
Do you hate me?

480
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,080
But what's done is done,

481
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,740
and resentment is pointless.

482
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,840
If love is a plant,

483
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,810
then money is the water.

484
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,680
Without money to nourish it,

485
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,010
even the most beautiful love will wither.

486
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,100
A poor couple faces endless sorrows.

487
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,640
I understand that now.

488
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,400
Juanzi.

489
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
I always knew you were no ordinary girl.

490
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,040
You think clearly and live with such insight.

491
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,000
Rather than both of us struggling with an uncertain future,

492
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,120
it's better to let one person find their own path.

493
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,920
Right?

494
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Yes.

495
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,040
I hope you establish yourself quickly in America.

496
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Who knows, I might need your help someday,

497
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,330
and you'll have to help me then.

498
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,560
Juanzi, don't worry.

499
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
As long as I'm able to,

500
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,170
I'll never abandon you.

501
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,520
You're so generous.

502
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,300
It makes me feel truly ashamed of myself.

503
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,450
You must wait for me.

504
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,120
Wait for me.

505
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,210
You must wait for me.

506
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,520
Wait for me.

507
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,200
Guoyang.

508
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,560
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,900
Do you have much luggage to take back?

510
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,280
What's up?

511
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,800
Could you take some luggage back for me?

512
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,360
I bought a lot of things for others,

513
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,420
mostly perfumes and stuff like that.

514
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,800
If you could take them back for me,

515
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,330
I'd save on shipping costs.

516
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
No problem,

517
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,260
just bring them over and I'll take them back for you.

518
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,480
Why does it smell so good?

519
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,680
When I was packing my luggage,

520
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,140
I broke a bottle of perfume

521
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
and it spilled everywhere inside.

522
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,160
I've got everything ready now.

523
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,400
Did the glass cut your hand?

524
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,320
No.

525
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,810
The suitcase is all packed,

526
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,820
so don't try to stuff anything else in there.

527
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,200
Goodbye.

528
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,440
Take care.

529
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,200
Can we talk?

530
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,720
Sure.

531
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,680
What's up?

532
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,880
I've made a decision,

533
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm leaving here and going back to China.

534
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,440
Great! That's wonderful,

535
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,040
finally no one to bother me anymore.

536
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,320
Do you have any conscience left?

537
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,820
There's an old saying,

538
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,960
trees die when transplanted, but people thrive with change.

539
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,160
With your cockroach-like resilience,

540
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,560
you'll definitely do better back home.

541
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,160
To be honest,

542
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,960
this was once my dream.

543
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,600
Now I've woken up to a mess.

544
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
Sometimes I keep wondering,

545
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,160
why am I working so hard every day,

546
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,800
what's it all for?

547
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,960
Isn't it just to have a better life?

548
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,880
Right.

549
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,400
With my current skills,

550
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,840
I'd definitely do better back in China than staying here.

551
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,580
Have you told Keke about this?

552
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,480
Can't bring yourself to tell her?

553
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,010
I don't know how to tell her.

554
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,920
Long-distance relationships.

555
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,080
I don't want her to go through that pain.

556
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,160
But why don't you ask her

557
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,890
if she's willing to go with you?

558
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,560
How can I promise her

559
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
that after returning to China with me,

560
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,320
she won't go hungry or cold,

561
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,760
or be unable to afford things she likes?

562
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,880
But whatever the outcome,

563
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,800
in this relationship,

564
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,520
she has the right to know.

565
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,040
Why do you keep following me? You're in the way.

566
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,760
Go sit over there.

567
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,800
No, let me do it.

568
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,360
Take a break.

569
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,040
No need. Go rest.

570
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,880
Sit there.

571
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
You know, I have a junior classmate

572
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,600
who recently came back to China,

573
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,800
but his girlfriend is still in America.

574
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,640
What? You want to take over?

575
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,080
Don't talk nonsense. I wouldn't dare.

576
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
I should hope not.

577
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,820
Has your junior come back yet?

578
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,040
Let me tell you,

579
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,440
women

580
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,040
hate wasting time waiting more than anything.

581
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,960
He-he-he probably won't be coming back.

582
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
He went back to his country for his career.

583
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
What happened? Did you break up?

584
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,000
No, the couple is still very much in love.

585
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,320
They call it long-distance relationship

586
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,040
and say many people are doing it these days.

587
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,280
That's nonsense.

588
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,240
So-called long-distance relationships

589
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,480
always end up the same way,

590
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
breaking up.

591
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,400
Think about it. You're dating someone

592
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,160
you can't see or touch.

593
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,560
Eventually, you run out of things to talk about

594
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,120
and can't even have a proper argument.

595
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,450
Is there any point in such a relationship?

596
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,640
Don't you have any faith in love?

597
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,460
Does that mean you have no faith in me either?

598
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,640
Don't make this about you.

599
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,160
I just think

600
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,760
there are too many uncertainties in real life.

601
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,500
This kind of long-distance relationship is just too fragile.

602
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,680
This is just Gu Nian's first draft.

603
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,140
Is there a latest version?

604
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,160
I used to organize all her materials.

605
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
But I haven't been there lately,

606
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,240
so I don't know if she has a new draft.

607
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,840
If you don't know, then go ask her.

608
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,640
Do I really need to teach you something this basic?

609
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,480
These are probably all her concepts.

610
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Even if she has a new draft,

611
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,010
it would still be based on these foundations.

612
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,400
Isn't that enough for you to know?

613
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm the one who decides what's acceptable.

614
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,640
How do I know if Gu Nian is holding something back?

615
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,880
I need her final draft before she goes on stage,

616
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,610
without a single word missing.

617
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,320
You've done all the research you need to

618
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,960
shouldn't you be spending more time

619
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,690
on your actual speech content?

620
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,100
Mind your own business first.

621
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,760
Nian Nian, are you there?

622
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
Nian Nian.

623
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Juan, why are you here?

624
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,719
I knew you'd be here

625
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,320
come in

626
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,850
you didn't answer my calls.

627
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,280
Have a seat.

628
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,719
I came to see if you've been slacking off

629
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,239
while I was away

630
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,520
how's your election preparation going?

631
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,239
Very well. Take a look.

632
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,480
So confident?

633
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,840
Let me check it.

634
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,760
How is it? Pretty good, right?

635
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,400
This is still your initial draft

636
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,159
I thought during this time

637
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,560
you would prepare a more refined, upgraded plan.

638
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,090
This is the best I could do within my abilities

639
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,639
and it incorporates your experiences

640
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,080
and wisdom too.

641
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,199
Nian Nian

642
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
do you have a backup plan?

643
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,320
A backup plan?

644
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
Why would I need a backup plan?

645
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm counting on this one

646
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,080
it's do or die.

647
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,480
But what if something goes wrong?

648
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,540
What could possibly go wrong?

649
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,520
For example

650
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
what if you get nervous on that day

651
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
your mind goes blank

652
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,740
and you can't remember anything.

653
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,000
What if they suddenly cancel the speech format

654
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,800
and switch to another election method?

655
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,560
And what if

656
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,040
someone else has the same ideas as you?

657
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,960
You need a backup plan

658
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,560
so you can respond to any situation

659
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,420
and avoid being caught off guard.

660
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,400
Juan, you're overthinking this

661
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,200
there won't be so many what-ifs.

662
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,240
I actually think this initial draft idea

663
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
isn't that fresh

664
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,770
your chances aren't great.

665
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,760
Really? Let me see.

666
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,960
Thank you.

667
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,010
Should I put this in?

668
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
Not the instant noodles.

669
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,520
By the way, Juan came to see me this afternoon.

670
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,240
How is she doing?

671
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,320
Guo Yang's situation must have affected her quite a bit.

672
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,560
She seemed fine actually.

673
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
But she said a lot of strange things.

674
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,600
She told me to prepare a backup plan.

675
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,880
And mentioned many bizarre things.

676
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,160
In the end, she just asked me to change the entire proposal.

677
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,400
Isn't that weird?

678
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
Yes, that is strange.

679
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,400
Reaching into every individual's heart.

680
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,640
Sounds good. What do you think?

681
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,280
Yeah, I think it sounds great.

682
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,960
We should vote for her.

683
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
Yes, we should cast our votes for her.

684
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,120
Reaching into every individual's heart.

685
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,600
Please vote for me.

686
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,760
Reaching into everyone's heart.

687
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,160
For my first round speech, I've decided on

688
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,020
focusing on individuals,

689
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,400
listening to their hearts.

690
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
What do you think?

691
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,800
Hello.

692
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,480
Please support Huang Xin'er in today's election.

693
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,800
Thank you.

694
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,040
Ivy Huang,

695
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,960
Huang Xin'er.

696
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,800
So this is what college elections are like.

697
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,480
Let's sit here.

698
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,160
Okay.

699
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,120
It's making me a bit nervous.

700
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,560
Just wait a bit.

701
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,840
They should be here soon.

702
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,320
What's going on?

703
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,720
Why did Huang Xin'er suddenly change

704
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,120
her campaign slogan?

705
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,450
What does this mean?

706
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
Gu Nian's campaign slogan is

707
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,200
'Focus on individuals, listen to hearts.'

708
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,760
As for Huang Xin'er,

709
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,560
although her wording is different,

710
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,880
but... but she...

711
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,800
the basic meaning is exactly the same.

712
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,720
Oh no, she's targeting Gu Nian!

713
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,640
Is that a problem?

714
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,560
It's like a fashion show,

715
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
about to begin,

716
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
and we find Huang Xin'er and Gu Nian wearing the same outfit.

717
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,240
And Huang Xin'er most likely

718
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,400
changed her outfit at the last minute.

719
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,080
That's not right.

720
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,140
Hey, Xiang.

721
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,960
Did you see Huang Xin'er's Facebook?

722
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,400
Yes, I did.

723
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,920
Gu Nian.

724
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,280
You've all seen Huang Xin'er's campaign slogan too.

725
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Gu Nian, she's copied you, totally crashed into your lane.

726
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,010
I don't know how this happened.

727
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,960
Such a degree of similarity,

728
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,480
could it really be coincidence?

729
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,320
She's obviously targeting you.

730
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,760
If this could be a coincidence,

731
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,920
I'll bang my head against a wall.

732
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,400
I don't think it's a coincidence either,

733
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,080
and if it was deliberate,

734
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,010
then the problem is quite serious.

735
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,720
Right, but Huang Xin'er is so smart,

736
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,720
she must be confident of winning

737
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,960
to make such a choice.

738
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
Actually, campaign slogans overlapping

739
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,440
has happened before.

740
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,210
But Huang Xin'er announced her new slogan first,

741
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,850
gaining the upper hand.

742
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,320
If you use yours afterward,

743
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,960
you'll have no advantage, no originality at all.

744
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
That Huang Xin'er is quite cunning,

745
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,600
even for a student council election,

746
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,560
she's really scheming.

747
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,360
Gu Nian? Where's Gu Nian?

748
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,200
Here.

749
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Today's first round of speeches is divided into four groups,

750
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,800
you're the second speaker in the first group.

751
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,920
The first one is Harek Simon.

752
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,580
The third one is Huang Xin'er.

753
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay, thanks.

754
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,880
Good luck.

755
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,200
This kind of speaking order is actually advantageous,

756
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,080
even if campaign ideas are similar,

757
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,520
the person who speaks first still has the advantage.

758
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,840
The first one is Hardik Newman,

759
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,800
the second is Gu Nian,

760
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,260
and the third is you, okay?

761
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay.

762
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,960
Good luck.

763
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,160
Gu Nian,

764
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,200
you can do it!

765
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,730
You'll definitely make it.

766
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,680
Don't worry.

767
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,800
Huang Xin'er,

768
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,800
come out for a moment.

769
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,600
I need to talk to you.

770
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,400
The election is about to start. What are you doing?

771
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,920
Xin'er, please listen to me

772
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,640
and stop crossing the line.

773
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,960
What do you mean?

774
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,600
What I mean is

775
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,600
stop trying to get your hands on Gu Nian's proposal

776
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,330
and don't plagiarize her work.

777
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,200
Don't be such a hypocrite.

778
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,520
You took those prohibited items

779
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
to get back at your ex-boyfriend.

780
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,850
You got what you wanted,

781
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,810
and now you regret betraying your friend?

782
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,400
Our deal ends here.

783
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,260
Listen carefully, Huang Xin'er.

784
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,720
I didn't frame Guo Yang,

785
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,800
so I'm asking you

786
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,860
to stop stealing Gu Nian's proposal.

787
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,720
Otherwise,

788
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,240
I'll reveal the whole truth.
