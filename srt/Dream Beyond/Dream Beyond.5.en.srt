1
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,130
You know what Zhuo Peng is like.

2
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,479
He never consults me about anything he does,

3
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,340
I really don't know much about it.

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,720
You're putting me in a difficult position.

5
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
Why is Zhuo Peng avoiding me?

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,330
He has his own thoughts.

7
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,000
I'd rather not get involved in the details,

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,460
because

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm afraid I might say something wrong.

10
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,600
Since you're so uncomfortable,

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
I'll just go find him myself.

12
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Um, this afternoon

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,520
I have a lot of work to do in the lab.

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,160
Here, take our house key.

15
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,450
You two can talk, I'll be back late.

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
He moved in with you?

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Wait,

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,329
you don't even know where he's living?

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
He gave up his perfectly good apartment,

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,040
moved into your place,

21
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,800
and he didn't

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,840
even discuss it with me?

23
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
This is about your company,

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,040
shouldn't you know about it?

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
The company is one thing,

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
but even if there are company issues,

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,850
he shouldn't be putting all his own money into it.

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,600
His life is a complete mess now,

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,460
he's homeless,

30
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,200
is he always this impulsive when dealing with problems?

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Lin Yao,

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,840
that's not fair.

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Do you really think Zhuo Peng did all this

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,640
for Lizhong Study Abroad Company?

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,200
No matter the reason,

36
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
he shouldn't be so reckless.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,360
You're right,

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,920
he is being reckless now.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
I don't know why,

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
he keeps avoiding me,

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,220
and I have no idea what he's planning.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,880
Please tell him

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,040
I'll pay him back as soon as possible.

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,560
Lin Yao,

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,960
honestly,

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,920
I want to ask you,

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,040
do you really know Zhuo Peng?

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,040
Do you remember when we just graduated?

49
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,810
He wanted to study psychology in England,

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
but you didn't want to leave,

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,480
so he stayed for you.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
He stayed in America

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
and took a job he didn't even like,

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
but one you thought was stable and reliable

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,280
with good prospects.

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,280
Do you know how deeply he yearns for psychology?

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Do you?

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,600
Have you ever cared?

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,960
All these years,

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,640
his dream has never changed.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
And now,

62
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,240
that professor he's always idolized

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,839
is finally accepting students again after eight years.

64
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,480
Do you realize how rare this opportunity is?

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,560
Then why doesn't he apply?

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
It's because of you.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,920
He's doing all of this for you, Lin Yao.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,760
He used his own money to solve your company's problems,

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,159
he gave up applying to the program he loves,

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,520
he stays up late working,

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
he accepts promotions and raises at the company,

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,440
everything he does is for you, Lin Yao.

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,600
Lin Yao, I don't know what you're thinking,

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,440
I really don't know if

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Zhuo Peng is even part of your plans.

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,800
I only know that

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
you are in every step

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
of Zhuo Peng's plans.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,720
This is our best-selling model this year.

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
Would you like to take a look?

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Best-selling means many people already have it, right?

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
Our rings come with

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,040
a name engraving service,

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,840
so finding an identical one is almost impossible.

85
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,880
Could you please take that one out for me?

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,320
Of course.

87
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,920
Thank you.

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,520
Here you go.

89
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,200
Thanks.

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,520
This one is classic and relatively simple.

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,640
Perfect. I'll take this one.

92
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,440
You have excellent taste.

93
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
Thank you.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Lin Yao, I was just about to call you.

95
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
I wanted to ask if you have time to meet up?

96
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
Yes, I'm sorry.

97
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,960
I've been too busy to see you lately.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
I've already made a reservation

99
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,760
at Brothers Burger tonight at 7.

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Great, see you tonight.

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,800
Sir, please confirm this again.

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Okay, thank you.

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,640
I don't think the person

104
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,780
you're buying this for will like this style.

105
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,810
How would you know without trying?

106
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,680
No need.

107
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,250
I can tell you the answer directly.

108
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,760
That pair of earrings

109
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,159
is what Lin Yao would actually like,

110
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,360
very tasteful.

111
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,280
These earrings are too conventional,

112
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
they look dated,

113
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,120
Lin Yao would never

114
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,050
choose to wear this style herself.

115
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,680
What you think is tasteful

116
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,560
is just the price tag.

117
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,040
Lin Yao has never really liked

118
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,680
the subtlety of Chinese ink paintings.

119
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
She prefers

120
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,800
the bold and vibrant oil paintings.

121
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,320
From the early Venetian school,

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
Titian is her favorite.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
And from the later Baroque period,

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
she likes Poussin who inherited Titian's style.

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
Her taste is very consistent,

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,880
I know exactly what she likes.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm sorry, but I don't have the time or need

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
to discuss Lin Yao's preferences with you.

129
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,360
The purpose of my visit today

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,570
was originally to ask you about

131
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,600
Lin Yao's various interests,

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,530
to understand more aspects of her.

133
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,280
But unexpectedly,

134
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,600
it seems

135
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
I need to give you some

136
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,760
advice on proposing.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Not necessary,

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,159
I have my own answers.

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,159
And also,

140
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,480
my relationship with Lin Yao

141
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
is not for you to comment on.

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
Lin Yao loves paintings,

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but you can only give her art books,

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,560
while I can give her original artworks.

145
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,409
For an engagement ring,

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,880
you'd spend everything you have

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,480
just to afford a basic model.

148
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,640
But me? I can give Lin Yao

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,720
her favorite limited editions.

150
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,040
Mr. Zhuo Peng,

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I just want to remind you of one thing.

152
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
What you want to give her,

153
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
Lin Yao doesn't need.

154
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,440
What Lin Yao needs,

155
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,040
you can't give her even if you wanted to.

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,640
So in your eyes,

157
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,450
Lin Yao is someone who only cares about material things?

158
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
Of course not.

159
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
What she wants is love.

160
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,200
Love requires sincerity and genuine feelings.

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,440
Although I haven't known Lin Yao for long,

162
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,799
it's been enough time

163
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,080
for me to accompany her

164
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,679
to every art gallery and museum she wanted to visit.

165
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
But

166
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,000
it might cause her some inconvenience.

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,440
After all,

168
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,160
she doesn't want to lie to you.

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
But deep down, she's happy.

170
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,520
This kind of happiness

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,600
has been missing when she's with you for a long time.

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
You love hamburgers.

173
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,920
But Lin Yao hasn't eaten meat

174
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,050
for a long time because she's on a diet.

175
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
You and Lin Yao take anniversary photos every year,

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,800
which she really dislikes.

177
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,440
You never noticed any of this, did you?

178
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,400
Lin Yao, such a wonderful girl,

179
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,060
has been suppressing her true personality just to please you.

180
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,280
You're just a temporary intruder.

181
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't think your money

182
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,970
can change everything.

183
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,080
I just don't want to see

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,890
Lin Yao suffering anymore.

185
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,280
Remember,

186
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
think carefully before proposing,

187
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,960
otherwise you'll push Lin Yao

188
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,160
into an even more difficult situation.

189
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
I actually know everything.

190
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
Know what?

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
You gave all your money

192
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,300
to compensate the students from Lizhong Study Abroad.

193
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
You even gave up your apartment

194
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,160
and moved in with Xiang Nongchao.

195
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,880
What else?

196
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,480
Also,

197
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
you gave up studying psychology in England.

198
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,280
You stayed to accept a promotion and work hard.

199
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
What else?

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,930
But Zhuo Peng...

201
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,880
Let me tell you something, okay?

202
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,040
The night I came to America,

203
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,250
it was an early morning flight.

204
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,600
You and Teacher Lin took a taxi to see me off at the airport.

205
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
When you came to the airport,

206
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,130
you were still wearing those fluffy bunny slippers.

207
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,560
Your hair was a mess,

208
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,850
and you were crying like a raccoon.

209
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
You held onto my arm

210
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,880
and refused to let me go.

211
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,440
Even though I was only 10 years old then,

212
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,480
I made a promise to myself

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,410
that I would never leave you again.

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,400
The night before you came to America,

215
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,560
I withdrew all the money I'd saved from my part-time jobs,

216
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,520
in case you couldn't get used to

217
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,360
the food here in America,

218
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,440
so I could take you out to restaurants anytime.

219
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,450
You're still laughing.

220
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
Right now,

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400
you look just like that night

222
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,600
when you came to see me off at the airport,

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,320
ugly.

224
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,040
Really?

225
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
Is my makeup smeared?

226
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,160
A little.

227
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
But I'm wearing waterproof makeup.

228
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
Lin Yao,

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,260
what I really want to say is...

230
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
What were you about to say?

231
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,520
Look who's back, everyone!

232
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,680
Welcome back,

233
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,540
good to see you.

234
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,480
You haven't fully recovered yet.

235
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
Why rush back to work?

236
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
I've been worried about you.

237
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,040
Paula, let me tell you,

238
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
while you were gone,

239
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,970
we couldn't sell any bubble tea at all.

240
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Thank you so much.

241
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,680
The boss told me

242
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
you saved my job.

243
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
During this time,

244
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,740
you've worked so hard.

245
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,170
Get back to work, everyone!

246
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
Honey.

247
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,760
Why is there $1,500 in this drawer?

248
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,730
It's Gu Nian's rent.

249
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
Wait, that's not right.

250
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,860
Isn't her rent supposed to be $1,000?

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Why are you charging her $1,500?

252
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm doing her such a big favor,

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,760
so I'm only charging her an extra $500.

254
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
Only an extra $500?

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,660
Is that really the point here?

256
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,800
Guo Yang,

257
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,970
Zhuo Peng asked you to help her,

258
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,080
how could you take advantage of a young girl like this?

259
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Let's go.

260
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,640
Where to?

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
To find Gu Nian.

262
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,000
What for?

263
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,810
Get a refund.

264
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,600
Refund for what?

265
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,780
Gu Nian, the fridge is broken.

266
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,900
It's fine. It's always like that.

267
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,720
This place is really run-down.

268
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
It's just temporary anyway.

269
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,340
How much is this per month?

270
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,760
1,500. Not bad, right?

271
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,000
1,500?

272
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,680
Didn't your friend rent this for you?

273
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,280
Yes.

274
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,480
This place

275
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,440
should be 1,000 at most, absolute maximum.

276
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,720
How do you know?

277
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,800
When I was scouting locations for the maternity center,

278
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
I checked out every property in Seattle.

279
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,440
I know everything.

280
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,100
Have a seat. I'll get the door.

281
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,120
Nian Nian.

282
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,160
What brings you here?

283
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,840
Come in, come in.

284
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
You came to see me.

285
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,850
I have a friend over.

286
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,500
Are we coming at a bad time?

287
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,400
Not at all. This is my new friend,

288
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
Zhu Keke.

289
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
This is Liu Juan and Guo Yang.

290
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Hello.

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
We were shopping earlier

292
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,000
and I saw lots of snacks

293
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,360
that I thought you'd like.

294
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,160
Thank you.

295
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,800
How's the place? Getting used to it?

296
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,730
It's quite nice.

297
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,780
This thermos is really great,

298
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,520
it keeps things hot for a long time.

299
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,400
Thanks.

300
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,600
Nian Nian, let's talk outside.

301
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,440
Okay.

302
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,760
Just say what you need to say here.

303
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Why go elsewhere?

304
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,450
Trying to scam money again?

305
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,040
What a pair of swindlers.

306
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
What are you talking about?

307
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,740
Afraid to admit what you've done?

308
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,760
I've checked the rent for this place.

309
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,690
It's 1,000 yuan,

310
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,400
but you're charging Gu Nian 1,500.

311
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
If that's not a scam, what is?

312
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,400
Keke, stop it.

313
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,200
Look, 800, 1,000.

314
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,160
They're charging you 1,500.

315
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,940
These are the prices for basements in this area.

316
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,640
Watch how you talk.

317
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,920
If you really consider Gunian a friend,

318
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
when she was looking everywhere for a place,

319
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,690
why didn't you help her?

320
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,520
You think I overcharged her?

321
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,650
Where were you then?

322
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,960
Let me tell you,

323
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,080
when we asked Guo Yang for help,

324
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,400
this was the price.

325
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,280
Don't try to change the subject.

326
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,920
The price is what it should be.

327
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,840
Why are you scamming a young girl?

328
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,760
How many deals have you pulled?

329
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,290
Targeting people you know?

330
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
And you call yourselves college students.

331
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,000
What do they teach you in college?

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
How to pull dirty tricks?

333
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
Look, if you have something to say, say it to me.

334
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm the one renting her apartment,

335
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,040
so why are you nagging my wife?

336
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,280
Are you crazy or what?

337
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,850
Guoyang, stop arguing.

338
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,200
Nian Nian,

339
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,120
if you think the rent is too high,

340
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,360
it's okay, you don't have to rent it.

341
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,360
Honey.

342
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,880
Honey, I...

343
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,160
Food, kettle.

344
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,580
The tenant always pays in the end.

345
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,079
Honey.

346
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't bother with someone like her,

347
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
what does she know anyway?

348
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,160
And that Gu Nian,

349
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
just standing there like an idiot,

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,240
not even saying a word to help us.

351
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,440
But it's all my fault.

352
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,440
I shouldn't have arranged this apartment for Gu Nian.

353
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
Otherwise, we wouldn't have all these problems.

354
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,119
It's all my fault, honey.

355
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,180
But the way you stood up for me just now

356
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,480
was so cool.

357
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,520
What else could I do?

358
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,960
If I don't defend you,

359
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
should I join outsiders in criticizing you?

360
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Everything was planned so well.

361
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,880
Just return the money and it would be over.

362
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,320
How did this person suddenly appear out of nowhere?

363
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,520
Right? This Gu Nian is really something.

364
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,480
Although she's connected to Zhuo Peng,

365
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,000
I did put in real work.

366
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,440
Look, Zhuo Peng is our good friend,

367
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,360
but Gu Nian isn't.

368
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
I genuinely wanted to be good friends with Gu Nian,

369
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
but now that's impossible.

370
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,960
What friendship?

371
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
We don't even know

372
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,560
what her application results will be,

373
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,000
or if we'll ever see her again.

374
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Simply put, Gu Nian is just a stranger.

375
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Why get angry with a stranger?

376
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,700
It's not worth it. She's just a stranger.

377
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,520
Don't be angry anymore, okay?

378
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,080
I tried to return the money

379
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
let's just spend it

380
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,040
and get something nice to eat.

381
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,680
Spend it all on a feast

382
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,080
blow it all on food.

383
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,880
Eating alone.

384
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,800
A cappella concert.

385
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,120
18th Century Literature Forum.

386
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
Green Knights Club.

387
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,020
Economics Department Recruitment.

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,320
Studying here must be really interesting.

389
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,240
What are you doing?

390
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,720
I regularly clean up these notices

391
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,840
all of these are expired.

392
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
But this one isn't expired

393
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
it's a job posting.

394
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,600
You're not a student at our school, are you?

395
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
Our school doesn't allow

396
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,840
job postings to be put up here directly

397
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,320
they all need approval from the student union and school committee

398
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,050
not just posted here like this.

399
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
These ads are really well-designed.

400
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,890
It's a bit of a shame.

401
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
$5 for 2 hours,

402
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,370
with only 3 minutes of presentation time.

403
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,720
How can anyone make money this way?

404
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,520
The last person who left a message here already failed.

405
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,120
This table leg was broken

406
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,720
during a fight with my boyfriend.

407
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
He's fine,

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,320
but my heart is broken.

410
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,520
If you also have an American dream,

411
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,680
my advice to you is

412
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,840
go back home immediately.

413
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,400
Will I ever be able to enjoy

414
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,520
my college life?

415
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,520
The design looks really nice.

416
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,280
Phone number, email.

417
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,120
I'm just like you all,

418
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,760
needing to showcase my abilities.

419
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,060
It's like I'm selling myself.

420
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
Our school doesn't allow

421
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,760
job postings to be put up here.

422
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,800
Everything must be approved by the student council

423
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400
and school committee first,

424
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,570
not just posted directly here.

425
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,280
Wait a minute.

426
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Job posting?

427
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,720
Dear Mr. Jordan,

428
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,640
hello.

429
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,400
I saw your company's job posting

430
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,040
on the Saint Helen bulletin board.

431
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,080
I have a good suggestion about recruitment

432
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
that would allow economics students from St. Helen University

433
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,650
to learn about your company directly.

434
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,450
Professor Zhuo,

435
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,480
have you figured out the assignment yet?

436
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,880
The deadline is tonight.

437
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,640
Don't worry, I'll definitely submit it to you before midnight.

438
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,480
I have a plan.

439
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
Everything's ready.

440
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,720
Remember you also need to prepare a presentation.

441
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,520
Although you won't be formally presenting in class,

442
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,920
it's still an interview after all,

443
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
so verbal expression is very important.

444
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,320
Is your spoken English okay?

445
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,240
Of course,

446
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,080
I was the National High School English Debate Competition

447
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,740
champion three years in a row.

448
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,600
Great, see you tomorrow then.

449
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
See you tomorrow.

450
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,880
Professor Zhuo.

451
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Is your presentation ready?

452
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,570
Yes, it's ready.

453
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,840
Nervous?

454
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,080
Not at all.

455
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,880
Let's go then.

456
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,850
I haven't finished my work yet.

457
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Go ahead.

458
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
Thanks.

459
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,680
Good luck.

460
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,320
Thank you.

461
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,640
Let's go.

462
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,360
What's wrong?

463
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,360
Let's tie your ponytail higher.

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,800
Relax a bit.

465
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
Don't worry. I've handled bigger situations before.

466
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Alright, let's go.

467
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,800
Okay.

468
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
That bald guy.

469
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,100
Wait for my signal.

470
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,600
Professor Conway, sorry to disturb you.

471
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,060
I'm a guest of the bride. My name is Zhuo Peng.

472
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,920
If you don't mind,

473
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,840
you assigned some homework for your economics class recently,

474
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,200
and

475
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
a Chinese student has completed it as well.

476
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,400
Would you mind taking a look at her work?

477
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,920
Sure,

478
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,200
we can do it now.

479
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
If that's alright.

480
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
Excuse me, friends,

481
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,640
this is the joy of being a professor.

482
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,160
It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor Conway.

483
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,600
Here's my proposal.

484
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,280
You two talk.

485
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,290
Please, have a seat.

486
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,540
Bartender, one drink please.

487
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,720
Very creative. How did you come up with this?

488
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,720
I think...

489
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I believe...

490
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Please, sit down.

491
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
No, thanks.

492
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,840
Alright.

493
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
It's okay, don't worry.

494
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,400
Thank you, it's fine.

495
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,080
Thank you.

496
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,360
Thanks.

497
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,840
Professor.

498
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,720
So this wasn't a coincidence today, was it?

499
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,600
Nothing gets past you, Professor Conway.

500
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,800
This is Gu Nian. She's applying to St. Helen University.

501
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,840
Although she lacks overseas experience,

502
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,640
her academic performance is exceptional,

503
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
and she's consistently been a top student in China.

504
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,640
I see.

505
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,200
You're questioning my policy

506
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,960
of limiting admissions for students without study abroad experience,

507
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,920
aren't you? You came prepared.

508
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,280
I don't mean to offend you.

509
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,920
I just want to know what you think of her proposal.

510
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
It's quite surprising.

511
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,760
Hello, Professor Conway.

512
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,360
Hello.

513
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,880
Would you join us at our table?

514
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,120
I'd be delighted to.

515
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,880
Hey.

516
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,140
What happened back there?

517
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,400
Have a seat.

518
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,440
Please,

519
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,800
won't you sit down?

520
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,400
Sit.

521
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,440
My mind just completely froze,

522
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,680
I couldn't remember anything.

523
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,880
Didn't you say last night that you had memorized it well,

524
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,340
that you knew it fluently?

525
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,080
The assignment is actually quite misleading.

526
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,280
It's not about how to make the most money with $5

527
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,680
in two hours.

528
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,600
but how much those three minutes of classroom presentation are worth.

529
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,920
So I decided to hold a bidding competition.

530
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,680
Wait, how am I speaking English again?

531
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,560
Did I mess everything up?

532
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
He told me that

533
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,920
his students in class

534
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,520
only focused on the $5 for two hours condition,

535
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,160
their thinking was boxed in,

536
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,120
and not a single person noticed

537
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,180
the value of those three minutes of presentation time.

538
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,240
But you figured it out.

539
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
You thought of selling those three minutes

540
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,040
to companies that want

541
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,160
to recruit at the school through bidding.

542
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,240
You essentially treated those three minutes

543
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,400
as recruitment advertising space for sale.

544
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,280
And in terms of the final amount,

545
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,970
you came in first place.

546
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,240
What do you mean?

547
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,840
Did I do the best?

548
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
Can't you understand Chinese now either?

549
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,520
But

550
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,720
my brain is completely blank right now.

551
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,040
No, seriously, what does it mean?

552
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,240
It means that

553
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,160
you identified the aspect of this problem

554
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,320
with the most value-adding potential.

555
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,120
In short, he's very impressed with you.

556
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,520
Did you understand that?

557
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,970
He's impressed with me.

558
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,480
Professor Conway is impressed with me.

559
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,280
Professor Conway is impressed with me.

560
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,160
So, wait,

561
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,560
that means I won, right?

562
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
So what?

563
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Debate champion three times in a row,

564
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
and I still had to bail you out in the end.

565
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,960
He's impressed with me.

566
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,000
Professor Conway is impressed with me.

567
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
Gu Nian, having a nice chat?

568
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,680
If you're done chatting, come help me catch fish in the kitchen.

569
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,740
There's a ton of work waiting for you.

570
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Professor Zhuo,

571
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,460
I have to go catch fish now.

572
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,210
He's impressed with me.

573
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,680
He really appreciates me.

574
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,930
Darling,

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,400
most of the guests have arrived,

576
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,160
we should go over there now.

577
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,320
Okay, let's go.

578
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,730
You look beautiful.

579
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,320
Hello.

580
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
Xuwei,

581
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,520
you look gorgeous today. Congratulations!

582
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,320
Thank you.

583
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,280
Why are you still wearing your school uniform today?

584
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,400
You two chat.

585
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,200
I lost my suitcase.

586
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,160
Let me introduce you,

587
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,800
this is my bridesmaid for today.

588
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,680
Hello.

589
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,280
It's you.

590
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,640
Oh, it's you.

591
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,360
Is your hand feeling better?

592
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,880
Much better,

593
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,000
it doesn't hurt anymore.

594
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,120
You two know each other?

595
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,440
Lin Yao,

596
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,520
while you were away,

597
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,840
Zhuopeng has put so much effort into Lizhong Study Abroad,

598
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,440
look,

599
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,240
he's even using my wedding to interview students.

600
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,240
In the next couple of days,

601
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,880
pay attention to your arm,

602
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,610
you can't be careless about it.

603
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,800
He is my fiancé.

604
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,980
Lin Yao is really his girlfriend?

605
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,160
You're Lin Yao.

606
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,840
You're a student from Lizhong Study Abroad?

607
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,500
You can't possibly be Lin Yao.

608
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,920
Gu Nian.

609
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,880
Gu Nian.

610
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,680
Professor Conway has some more questions for you,

611
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
come on, let's go.

612
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,690
Is she your girlfriend?

613
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes.

614
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,840
That guy who bumped into me last time

615
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,080
said he was her fiancé.

616
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Gu Nian.

617
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,920
I'm sorry, Xu Wei,

618
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,120
I'm not feeling well,

619
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,600
I need to leave now. Sorry.

620
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Lin Yao.

621
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm sorry.

622
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Lin Yao.

623
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,600
Darling, are you okay?

624
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,680
Gu Nian.

625
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,200
Come with me for a moment.

626
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,690
To have an affair discovered like this is really something.

627
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,080
Lin Yao.

628
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,840
Stop following me,

629
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,280
haven't I been humiliated enough?

630
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,640
I'm sorry,

631
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,040
I completely forgot she had met you before.

632
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,360
You knew she had met me?

633
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,680
You've known about me from Gu Nian all along

634
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,800
and kept it from me.

635
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,520
I didn't learn it from Gu Nian.

636
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,960
I saw it myself.

637
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,620
It was just a coincidence.

638
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,000
That day when you had the accident

639
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,240
when you hit Gu Nian,

640
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,480
I saw you with him with my own eyes.

641
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,360
You've known since then?

642
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,120
I wasn't sure it was you.

643
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,520
Don't say anything more.

644
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,340
I was planning to propose to you that day.

645
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,400
Lin Yao.

646
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,940
What I really want to say is...

647
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,680
What did you just say?

648
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,280
Those earrings

649
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,620
are what Lin Yao really likes.

650
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,480
Zhuo Peng,

651
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,000
what are you trying to say?

652
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,640
What you want to give, Lin Yao doesn't need.

653
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,000
What Lin Yao needs,

654
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,120
you can't give even if you wanted to.

655
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,650
What I really want to say is,

656
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
let's break up.

657
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,760
Break up?

658
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,860
Although all these years,

659
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,800
I've been unwilling to admit it,

660
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,370
but I'm truly not the right person for you.

661
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,280
Not right?

662
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,720
Lin Yao,

663
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,840
I know you want a privileged

664
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
and stable life.

665
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,280
But me,

666
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,940
I'm used to being idle,

667
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,840
I can't be as ambitious as you want,

668
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,700
I can't give you the life you want.

669
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,920
I don't want to hold you back anymore.

670
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,280
Zhuo Peng.

671
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,680
Don't say anything more,

672
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,320
I've already made up my mind.

673
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,520
But I have one request.

674
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,440
Could we wait until

675
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
after Xu Wei's wedding

676
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
to tell our friends?

677
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,880
The wedding is coming soon,

678
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,080
and she's asked you to be her bridesmaid.

679
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,540
On such a joyous occasion,

680
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,130
could we go together and be happy about it?

681
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,880
Don't let our friends worry about us,

682
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,940
don't give them a chance to bother us.

683
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,360
I had the ring ready.

684
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,040
I was going to propose to you.

685
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,290
But I broke up with you instead.

686
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,880
Because I didn't want to put you in a difficult position,

687
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,239
didn't want you to be the one to say it first.

688
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,400
You think everything you did

689
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,460
was for my own good,

690
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,719
so good that you even broke up with me on my behalf,

691
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,280
and only I, Lin Yao, am an ungrateful liar.

692
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,840
You think you're so noble, don't you?

693
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,600
Lin Yao.

694
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,280
I don't know why you're saying this.

695
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
You know that's not what I think.

696
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,860
You've known how I feel all along,

697
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,239
yet you pretended not to notice,

698
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,040
watching me struggle with anxiety and confusion.

699
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,370
Was that amusing to you?

700
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,800
Please stop saying these things

701
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,360
that hurt us both.

702
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,340
Let me tell you, Zhuopeng,

703
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
you were absolutely right that day.

704
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,679
I chose someone else

705
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,280
because you couldn't give me the life I wanted.

706
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,240
You've made your choice,

707
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,360
I won't blame you.

708
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
But I just hope you can give

709
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,130
our decade-long relationship

710
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,330
at least one beautiful memory.

711
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,680
Is there any left?

712
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
All the beautiful things between us

713
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,120
were just now,

714
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,200
in front of all our friends,

715
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,080
completely destroyed.

716
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,180
That's enough.

717
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Go wash the dishes in the back now.

718
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,040
I...

719
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,170
What do you mean 'I'?

720
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,200
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?

721
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
I didn't mean to cause trouble.

722
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,360
I was just telling the truth.

723
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,280
Do you realize what you've said?

724
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,480
But she really didn't tell me she was Lin Yao,

725
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,340
and she even said she had a fiancé.

726
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,080
Fine, let's say everything you said is true.

727
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,760
Yes, what you said is true,

728
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,760
but shouldn't you consider the right time and place to expose someone?

729
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,240
Look at the mess you've created.

730
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,880
Lin Yao couldn't stay and ran off,

731
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,640
and Zhuo Peng went after her, didn't he?

732
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,480
Now at Xu Wei's wedding,

733
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,600
they can't even find the bridesmaid.

734
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,560
I swear,

735
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,720
dealing with a stubborn kid like you...

736
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm just

737
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,380
wasting my breath, honestly.

738
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,040
Just go do your work.

739
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
But if Lin Yao really did something

740
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,360
to hurt Professor Zhuo,

741
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,890
I think he deserves to know.

742
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,400
I know you two have a close teacher-student relationship.

743
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,920
Let me tell you,

744
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,440
Zhuo Peng sacrificed himself just so you could meet Professor Conway,

745
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,360
he put everything on the line for you,

746
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,090
so think about that for a while.

747
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,600
What do you think is really going on between Zhuo Peng and Lin Yao?

748
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
They've been together for so many years,

749
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,330
what could Lin Yao be thinking?

750
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,360
Are you really surprised about what happened with Lin Yao?

751
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,000
I actually think it's quite normal.

752
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,800
To be honest,

753
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,440
I've always wondered

754
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,640
how Zhuo Peng ended up with Lin Yao in the first place.

755
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,300
They're completely different types of people.

756
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,080
Besides,

757
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,240
when I first met Lin Yao,

758
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,570
I could tell she was really something.

759
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,560
Her eyes were

760
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,360
full of ambition and desire.

761
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
And another thing,

762
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,560
she founded Lizhong Study Abroad all by herself,

763
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,890
she's such a go-getter.

764
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,040
Could Lizhong Study Abroad be what it is today without Zhuo Peng?

765
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,000
Do you know how much Zhuo Peng sacrificed for that company,

766
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
how much he suffered!

767
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,000
You can't look at it that way.

768
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,400
People always aim higher,

769
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,280
maybe she found a better option.

770
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,360
So what you're saying is,

771
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
if someone finds a better option,

772
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,320
it's okay to betray your relationship?

773
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,920
No,

774
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
I was just making a comparison.

775
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,600
What comparison?

776
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,520
Besides, we don't even know

777
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
what the truth really is.

778
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,200
Maybe in a few days they'll get past this rough patch

779
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,320
and make up again.

780
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,920
You can forgive betrayal?

781
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,250
I definitely couldn't.

782
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,240
What if it were me?

783
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,320
Are you planning to betray me?

784
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,050
What's wrong with finding out?

785
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,080
Keep driving! Keep driving!

786
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,600
No, that's wrong! Wrong!

787
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,260
I'll bite you to death.

788
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,240
How could we possibly not get married?

789
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,970
How could we possibly break up?

790
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,080
How could she possibly reject me?

791
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,840
We've known each other since childhood,

792
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,960
been together for so many years.

793
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,000
Bro, where does all this confidence come from?

794
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,120
This isn't confidence,

795
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,180
it's that Lin Yao and I have a very stable relationship.

796
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,960
Although I haven't known Lin Yao for long,

797
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,560
I know exactly what she likes,

798
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,220
enough for me to accompany her

799
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,240
to every art gallery and museum she wants to visit.

800
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,480
This kind of happiness with you

801
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
hasn't happened for a long time.

802
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,840
You and Lin Yao take photos to commemorate every year.

803
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,440
She doesn't even like

804
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,240
these things, but you've never noticed, have you?

805
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,160
Lin Yao is such a nice girl

806
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,960
who's been suppressing her true personality just to please you.

807
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,840
Surprise?

808
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,760
Every year, for all those holidays and anniversaries,

809
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,320
it's always the same routine,

810
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,040
what kind of surprise is that?

811
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,040
No matter what holiday or anniversary,

812
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,560
it's always the exact same thing:

813
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,360
flowers, cake, photos,

814
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,760
you haven't even changed the location.

815
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,440
Man on the left, woman on the right.

816
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,240
What makes you so confident

817
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,440
that Lin Yao will definitely marry you?

818
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,040
You're pushing Lin Yao into

819
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,970
an even more difficult situation.

820
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,360
Mom.

821
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
What's wrong?

822
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,880
You sound upset.

823
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,680
No, everything's fine.

824
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,520
How was the interview?

825
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,400
Did you do well?

826
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,840
It went well, really well.

827
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,760
Very smoothly.

828
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,400
That's good to hear.

829
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,840
So you can come back tomorrow with peace of mind.

830
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,300
Your dad and I will pick you up at the airport.

831
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,160
Got it.

832
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,280
Bye-bye.

833
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,800
Coming!

834
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,360
Don't clean up.

835
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,600
Why is your place such a mess?

836
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,930
There's nowhere to sit.

837
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,600
Just tell me what you want.

838
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,840
If it's not convenient,

839
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,370
we can talk somewhere else.

840
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,480
I know

841
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,810
you wouldn't be comfortable here anyway.

842
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,560
Wait while I put something on.
