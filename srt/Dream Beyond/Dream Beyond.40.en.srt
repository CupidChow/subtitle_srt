1
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,920
This scene feels familiar.

2
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
That's right, another protest,

3
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,500
and once again, only you're here with me.

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,340
That's not necessarily true.

5
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,600
Isn't Gu Nian coming?

6
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Why did you order so little food?

7
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,890
They're not coming.

8
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,050
There's something I want to talk to you about privately.

9
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,960
You know I don't like Korean food,

10
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
yet you deliberately brought me here.

11
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,760
What are you trying to do?

12
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I...

13
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,200
I just wanted

14
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,260
to sit at the place where we had our first meal together.

15
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,560
Xiang Nongchao, you're being so hesitant,

16
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,020
what are you trying to say?

17
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
No, don't!

18
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,440
What do you mean 'don't'?

19
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
No, no, no!

20
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,720
What is it that you don't want?

21
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,780
Do you even know what I'm going to say?

22
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,120
Don't say something so important here!

23
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,760
I don't want to remember such an important moment

24
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,890
with nothing but the smell of pickles!

25
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,120
Wait, Keke, what are you talking about?

26
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
What moment?

27
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
Aren't you going to

28
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
What's that in your hand?

29
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,960
Let me see it.

30
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,440
A job offer.

31
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,760
This was sent to me by a company back home.

32
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,440
They really value overseas graduates

33
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,700
with advanced degrees

34
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,440
and they're very sincere about it.

35
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,100
The compensation is good too.

36
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
Mr. Wu has pushed me into a corner.

37
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,040
I can't stay in America anymore.

38
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,460
So I've decided to accept this offer.

39
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,000
Xiang Nongchao,

40
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,520
you're going too far!

41
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,320
Keke, I'm sorry.

42
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,050
I should have told you earlier,

43
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
but I couldn't bring myself to say it.

44
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,440
I specifically came to this restaurant

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,480
to tell you.

46
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,480
From the first moment I met you,

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,520
you've been deeply imprinted in my heart.

48
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,480
The truth is,

49
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,520
I've been too incompetent all along.

50
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
I can't give you a comfortable life,

51
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
and I keep making you suffer.

52
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Actually, the job market back home is really good now.

53
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,020
And our country needs people like us to return after completing our studies.

54
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,170
I don't think there's much to miss about America anyway.

55
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,080
Right, yes,

56
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
America really doesn't have anything worth missing.

57
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
No, no, Keke,

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
that's not what I meant.

59
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,320
America has you.

60
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
I mean... I mean...

61
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,560
I thought about this for a long time before making this decision.

62
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,440
I can't ask you

63
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
to go back with me and start from scratch.

64
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,600
I definitely can't ask you

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
to struggle alongside me.

66
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,400
Enough.

67
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,680
You've already made up your mind,

68
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,410
so what's the point of talking?

69
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
You never planned

70
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,850
to consider my opinion.

71
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
I just can't bear to see you suffer with me.

72
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,010
Xiang Nongchao,

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,400
why don't you ask

74
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
if I'm willing to go with you?

75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,000
Why don't you even want

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
to ask me?

77
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,740
You always said I misunderstood you.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
Now I understand.

79
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,740
I never misunderstood you at all.

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,200
Because in your heart, Xiang Nongchao,

81
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,530
you've always looked down on me, Zhu Keke.

82
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,200
Manager Lin,

83
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,850
you handled that beautifully.

84
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,800
I've already paid him,

85
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,240
and he promised that

86
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,970
he'll stay put quietly for now.

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
When Manager Lin takes action,

88
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,290
it's truly impressive.

89
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,120
He Bin,

90
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
let me tell you,

91
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,820
Mo Xiaorui only listens to me now.

92
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,580
If you want to resolve this matter properly,

93
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,420
you must let me into the company's inner circle.

94
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,400
Lin Yao, you've just completed one task

95
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,140
and you're already negotiating with me?

96
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,810
It's not a negotiation. There's nothing to discuss.

97
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,800
I've kept evidence of everything

98
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,730
about how this matter was handled.

99
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
If you continue to sideline me,

100
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
I can go to the police anytime.

101
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,440
So you're threatening me.

102
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,400
That's right,

103
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,600
we each get what we want,

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,250
and we can continue moving forward together.

105
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,640
Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,600
I actually admire your straightforwardness.

107
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
Then let me see your sincerity.

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,659
This flash drive contains everything you want to know.

109
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,520
After you've seen it,

110
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,880
we'll be official partners.

111
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,720
Professor Conway, I'm begging you to speak up

112
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,600
for Chinese students during the vote.

113
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
I understand how you feel,

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,240
but this isn't a good time.

115
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,040
Why?

116
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,320
As you know,

117
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,200
Huang Xin'er was the sophomore student council president

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,760
but she cheated her way in.

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,400
She's no longer in the student council.

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,400
But you understand,

121
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,520
the admissions committee isn't happy about this.

122
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,120
Now more and more people support raising

123
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,800
the admission score requirements for Chinese students

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,800
to limit their enrollment numbers.

125
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,170
You received the second highest votes

126
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,040
and should have taken the president position from Huang Xin'er.

127
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,960
But it was canceled because the school

128
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,360
no longer fully trusts Chinese students.

129
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,280
So who will take the position now?

130
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,770
Belly Marshall, who got the third most votes.

131
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,440
She's an athlete with a positive image.

132
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
I understand. Which side did she vote for?

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
She also supports the school administration.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,960
I can't help you now.

136
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,360
Teacher Zhuo, do you remember?

137
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Professor Conway once said

138
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
that students applying to St. Helen's

139
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,340
must have overseas study or living experience.

140
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,440
You had me do his assignment,

141
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
which completely changed his mind.

142
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,530
Yes, it was your performance that convinced him.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,840
But this time

144
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,770
even Professor Conway can't help me anymore.

145
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,440
The vote is tomorrow,

146
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,480
the outcome is still uncertain.

147
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Anyway,

148
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,220
I still have these 20 or 30 people supporting me.

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,000
So I'll bring this list

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to the voting site and give it a shot.

151
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,920
I know it's like throwing eggs against a stone,

152
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,680
but whatever happens,

153
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,180
I want to take this chance.

154
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
There's always hope even in desperate situations.

155
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
I believe your actions and determination

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,880
can change their minds.

157
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Actually, after Professor Conway rejected me today,

158
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,360
I knew deep down

159
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,930
that it would be difficult to change their minds.

160
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,320
I just don't want to give up, and I can't.

161
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
If the school really approves this

162
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
discriminatory policy against Chinese students,

163
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
then Saint Helen

164
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,040
will no longer be the prestigious institution I once thought it was.

165
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,530
I will voluntarily withdraw from school.

166
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,480
What? Withdraw?

167
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
I've prepared for the worst,

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,960
and that's my determination.

169
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,440
So we...

170
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,960
I mean, if...

171
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,640
if the resolution actually passes,

172
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
you'll leave?

173
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,920
Professor Zhuo,

174
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,160
I hope you can understand

175
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,880
and support my decision.

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Returning home to develop your career is a good thing

177
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,060
and should be encouraged.

178
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,880
Dropping out to protest shows your stance,

179
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
and I can't stop you,

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,460
I can only watch helplessly as you all leave.

181
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,320
You should stop her if that's what you want.

182
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,360
If you don't want Gu Nian to leave,

183
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,680
you need to speak up and tell her,

184
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,040
you have to let her know.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,440
When facing such a matter of principle as protesting injustice,

186
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
how could I use my personal feelings

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,060
to influence Gu Nian's decision?

188
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,600
Zhuo Peng,

189
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,080
we're bros, right?

190
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,800
No matter where we are,

191
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,330
we'll be lifelong friends.

192
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
But love is different,

193
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,360
love is too fragile,

194
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,840
it can't withstand time zones and distance.

195
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,760
Zhuo Peng, seriously,

196
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
you need to protect

197
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,320
what you have with Gu Nian,

198
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
you really

199
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,760
don't want to end up like me.

200
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,100
By the way, does Coco know you're leaving today?

201
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,440
She won't answer my calls or see me,

202
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
she must hate my guts.

203
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,600
So, have you decided to donate all your stuff?

204
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,800
Yes, minimalism is the way.

205
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm off.

206
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,040
Wait!

207
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,680
Please,

208
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
don't see me off,

209
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,000
I can go by myself.

210
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,160
I hate goodbyes more than anything.

211
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
Wait, wait!

212
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,800
You jerk. I'm gone.

213
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,840
Sorry,

214
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,960
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

215
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,000
Sorry,

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,130
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

217
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,280
Sorry,

218
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,520
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

219
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,280
No! Stop!

220
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,840
Help! Help!

221
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,640
Someone help me! Save me!

222
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,720
Someone save me! Anyone!

223
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,640
Stop!

224
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,120
Help!

225
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,600
Help me!

226
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,680
Save me!

227
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,640
It's all your fault!

228
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,080
If it weren't for your damn contract,

229
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,960
Xiang Nongchao would never have left America.

230
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,360
It's all because of you!

231
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,240
It's your fault, Xiang Nongchao,

232
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,400
why didn't you ask me to go with you?

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll voluntarily apply to drop out.

234
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
I hope you can understand

235
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,000
and support me.

236
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,240
I know you're worried about our long-distance relationship.

237
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,760
If I back down over something this small,

238
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,690
then I wouldn't be Gu Nian anymore.

239
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,080
Lin Yao,

240
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,920
Zhuo Peng,

241
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,320
I've reported He Bin for orchestrating exam fraud

242
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,520
and need you to come to the police station to testify.

243
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,640
What?

244
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
I only found out after reporting He Bin

245
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,680
that Yangfan Education

246
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,080
has been under police surveillance for some time.

247
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,840
I've reviewed all the documents.

248
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,920
You bought Lizhong Education at a premium

249
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,250
just to use it as a front for Yangfan's exam fraud operation.

250
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,640
Yes.

251
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,760
How could a new overseas

252
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,160
education agency be worth that much money?

253
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
We're simply leveraging Lizhong Education's good reputation

254
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,300
and the students' trust in it.

255
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,720
Facts prove my judgment was spot on.

256
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,080
You'd do anything for money.

257
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,120
Don't you like money too?

258
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,920
I do.

259
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,440
There you go.

260
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,200
Our business is booming now,

261
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,600
your joining us has great potential,

262
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,360
you don't need to worry about your future at all.

263
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
So many students and parents

264
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,960
dream of getting into Ivy League schools but have no way,

265
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,040
we're the ones helping them achieve their dreams.

266
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
What a noble way to 'achieve dreams.'

267
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,440
That's right, Manager Lin,

268
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
your first student Mo Xiaorui,

269
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,680
his dream is about to come true.

270
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,480
Correct. It's about to happen.

271
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,640
Didn't you say you'd bring him along today?

272
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,660
They're waiting outside.

273
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,080
Then ask him to come in.

274
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,760
Come in.

275
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,450
They secretly operate an exam fraud ring,

276
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,960
then rely on the high college acceptance rates from these fraudulent exams.

277
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,360
Creating fake performance

278
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,360
to inflate valuation and flip companies.

279
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,040
Lin Yao.

280
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,840
Zhuo Peng.

281
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
Thank you for coming.

282
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Did you just say

283
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,800
that before Yangfan acquired Lizhong Education

284
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,040
they flipped many small companies,

285
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,360
and they've been running all kinds of exam cheating services,

286
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,840
with proxy test-takers from many different countries?

287
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes. Thank you for opening my eyes earlier,

288
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,520
or I would have gotten involved with Yangfan Study Abroad

289
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,240
and there would be no turning back.

290
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,400
That's great.

291
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Great! Finally, we have a solution.

292
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,440
Thank you,

293
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,500
thank you, Lin Yao,

294
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,720
thank you.

295
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,280
Where's the officer in charge of this case?

296
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
Take me to him right away,

297
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
I need to give my statement immediately.

298
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
I'll go find him right away.

299
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,360
Let's go.

300
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,000
Alright, please sign here.

301
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
Thank you for your cooperation.

302
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you, officer.

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,560
Thanks.

304
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
Could I get a copy of the case file?

305
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm sorry, but we can't provide you with a copy of the case.

306
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,600
Professor Conway.

307
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
You again.

308
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,840
Professor Conway, just one last thing.

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,520
Can I go in and say a few words to everyone?

310
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,360
Are you serious?

311
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,720
Even though we don't have many signatures,

312
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,320
this is still the voice of the students.

313
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,200
Just give me five minutes, please?

314
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm sorry, this is against the rules.

315
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,280
I can't help you.

316
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,690
I think we don't have enough evidence.

317
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,840
So it's time to move on to the next topic.

318
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,280
We have too many students cheating.

319
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,370
You have no evidence to prove that.

320
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,240
Isn't this prejudice against Chinese students?

321
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,280
No, no, no.

322
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
This is fair.

323
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,560
Listen, we need to prevent problems before they happen.

324
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,240
You can't punish an entire group

325
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,440
because of one person's actions.

326
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,360
Stop being such a nice guy all the time.

327
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,680
It's getting late. We don't need to argue among ourselves.

328
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,400
Let's start voting.

329
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,960
I promise I'll present your evidence at the meeting.

330
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,880
If enough people oppose the proposal at the meeting,

331
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,320
it won't pass.

332
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,820
I support this school policy.

333
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,040
One vote.

334
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
In third place, Beli Marshall,

335
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,160
who supports the school's decision.

336
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,960
I support it.

337
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,400
Two votes.

338
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,480
I vote against it.

339
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,840
Two to one.

340
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
I still firmly oppose this.

341
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,680
Two to two.

342
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,040
I don't think this special treatment is right,

343
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,880
so I vote against it.

344
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,600
Two to three.

345
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
I stand by my position,

346
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
this is fairness in the broader sense,

347
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,840
I vote in favor.

348
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,360
Three to three.

349
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,840
I vote in favor.

350
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,600
Four to three.

351
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm sorry, I can't help you right now.

352
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
I know perfectly well

353
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,960
that it's hard to change their minds,

354
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,280
but I don't want to and can't give up.

355
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,680
I think the new policy proposed by the vice principal

356
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,360
Wait a minute.

357
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,920
Gu Nian, what are you doing?

358
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,720
I'm here to deliver a petition.

359
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,040
The school shouldn't ignore their opinions.

360
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,040
Gu Nian, you have no right to barge in here to protest.

361
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,800
We already have student council presidents,

362
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,920
and they represent the students' opinions.

363
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,480
Well, I'm already here anyway.

364
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,800
Can I see your votes?

365
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,220
I really want to know the results.

366
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
You'll know the results soon enough,

367
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,120
as long as you stop disrupting everyone.

368
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,440
I need to ask you to leave.

369
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,440
No, no,

370
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,560
I'm not leaving.

371
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,240
Miss Gu Nian, don't make me call campus security.

372
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,520
I'm not going anywhere.

373
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,800
This is the Vice Principal,

374
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,240
please come to the committee room immediately.

375
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,800
We have an agitated female student

376
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,160
who barged into our meeting and refuses to leave.

377
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,840
Vice Principal.

378
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,480
Respected professors and students.

379
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,040
I have here

380
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
an official report from the Seattle Police Department.

381
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,370
This report is crucial to our discussion,

382
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,410
and I urge you all to read it.

383
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm confident it will change your minds.

384
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,000
Alright, hand it over.

385
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,160
This means everything to me,

386
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,880
it's about the love of my life.

387
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,880
I've finally found my soulmate,

388
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,410
and I can't bear to lose her.

389
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,000
Hey, Professor Zhuo.

390
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,680
Gu Nian, I've got the evidence.

391
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,960
You need to do everything you can to buy us time.

392
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,680
Buy time? How?

393
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
By any means necessary.

394
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,280
Just make sure you stop them.

395
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,840
This Yangfan International Consulting Company

396
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,760
has been shut down by the police.

397
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,980
They're an international organization specializing in exam fraud.

398
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,400
The students involved in cheating come from all over the world,

399
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,620
including the United States.

400
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,960
Only a small portion of these students are Chinese.

401
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,040
Yes, the Chinese students involved in cheating are certainly at fault,

402
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,680
but we shouldn't generalize.

403
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Please consider carefully.

404
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Raising admission score requirements only for Chinese students

405
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,400
and limiting their enrollment quotas

406
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,400
is unfair.

407
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,920
The materials you've provided are very convincing.

408
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,280
I accept your viewpoints.

409
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,240
I vote against the new school policy.

410
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,680
But our deliberation is coming to an end.

411
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,320
Currently we have four votes for and four against.

412
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,720
Would anyone like to change their vote?

413
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,400
There's still one vote left.

414
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
The cheating scandal is not

415
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,940
the only reason for updating our admission policy.

416
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,720
Our resolution today is about

417
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,450
considering all these issues comprehensively.

418
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,000
I won't change my mind.

419
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,320
I vote in favor of the new policy.

420
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,680
But...

421
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,640
Miss Gu, you've already stated your position.

422
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,360
This isn't fair!

423
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,400
But the voting has ended,

424
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,080
the decision is final.

425
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,360
Miss Gu.

426
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,280
If Chinese applicants are qualified enough,

427
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,920
Saint Helen's doors will remain open to them,

428
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,440
just as they were for you.

429
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,000
This is an elite institution,

430
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,240
we strive for excellence.

431
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Looking out for yourself might make life easier,

432
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
but I can't do that.

433
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,760
You can ignore our voices,

434
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,080
you can disregard the police evidence.

435
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,240
But between self-preservation and justice,

436
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,400
I choose justice.

437
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
Gu Nian.

438
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,840
There's hope even in desperate situations.

439
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,880
I believe your actions and determination

440
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
can change their minds.

441
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,600
If the school really approves this

442
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,240
discriminatory policy against Chinese students.

443
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,040
Then Saint Helen

444
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,360
is no longer that perfect

445
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
and sacred institution I once believed in.

446
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,640
Since Saint Helen has made such an unfair decision

447
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,560
against Chinese students,

448
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,800
it's no longer the place of learning I once aspired to attend.

449
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,040
I cannot continue in such an environment.

450
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,410
I request to withdraw from school.

451
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,680
My once enthusiastic journey studying in America

452
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,160
has ended unexpectedly like this.

453
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,690
It's impossible to say I'm not disappointed,

454
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,200
but I don't regret making this decision.

455
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,400
During this year in America,

456
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,680
I gained many valuable experiences and insights,

457
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,800
and even more precious friendships.

458
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,120
After I left,

459
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,680
everyone continued on their own paths.

460
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,760
Professor Zhuo followed his original plan

461
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,440
to study his dream psychology program at Bath.

462
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
Liu Juan received an offer from a big company

463
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,720
and can now legally

464
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
stay and work hard in America.

465
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,360
Mom, look at my alien!

466
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,920
And our original song,

467
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,680
although it didn't win the competition,

468
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,840
helped Betty and Jessica reconcile.

469
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,680
Lin Yao.

470
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,840
Jessica, the boss is planning to promote me.

471
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,500
Thank you so much for recommending this job.

472
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Really? That's great!

473
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,920
Lin Yao, I really think you're amazing.

474
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,120
Keep up the good work.

475
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,400
I will.

476
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,640
Bye-bye.

477
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Teacher Lin has returned to China with her child.

478
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,880
Lin Yao has officially divorced

479
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
and found a new job.

480
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,840
She said she wants to work hard in America

481
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,500
and bring her child back when they're older.

482
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,500
What are you doing?

483
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,800
You're unbelievable.

484
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,730
How can anyone be as clueless as you

485
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,290
and so thoughtless?

486
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,679
Do you even sincerely want to propose?

487
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,940
What's wrong exactly?

488
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,159
You bought such a huge ring.

489
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,639
Do you think my fingers are that fat?

490
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
They said it can be resized.

491
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,880
Resized? How is that the same?

492
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,040
One of life's most important memories

493
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,320
would be altered like that.

494
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,639
It wouldn't be perfect anymore.

495
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,040
Does that really matter?

496
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,000
I could just

497
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
do it all over again.

498
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,440
What do you mean 'do it all over again'?

499
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,880
I think our values

500
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,360
are completely different.

501
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I see this as a serious issue,

502
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,020
and you think it's no big deal.

503
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,730
Maybe we shouldn't get married after all.

504
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,960
I'll beat you to death, you shameless jerk.

505
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
You deserve it, Wu.

506
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,300
You deserve a beating.

507
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,330
You absolutely deserve a beating.

508
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,320
You should be beaten.

509
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,520
Xiang Nongchao.

510
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,660
You deserve it. You deserve to be beaten.

511
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,800
Beat him!

512
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,960
Xiang Nongchao.

513
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,600
Keke.

514
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,160
Am I dreaming?

515
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,690
Tell me if you're dreaming.

516
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,120
No.

517
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,960
You came back to the country all by yourself.

518
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,490
I won't let you off the hook.

519
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,440
My lady, for your great kindness,

520
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,840
I have no way to repay you.

521
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,440
Perhaps I could offer myself to you in marriage?

522
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
So vain.

523
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,640
Wrong way! Wrong way!

524
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,700
You're holding it backwards.

525
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,200
What's wrong?

526
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,220
What's the matter?

527
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,240
By the way,

528
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,160
Coco told me she was in Seattle

529
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,520
when she hit Professor Wu,

530
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,440
and that's why she fled back to China.

531
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,680
Actually, I know

532
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,080
Coco wasn't running away,

533
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,920
but bravely facing reality.

534
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,960
She chose her love.

535
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,520
Sister Gu Nian.

536
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Thank you so much.

537
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,200
Thanks.

538
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,000
As for me,

539
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,760
after leaving St. Helen, I returned to China.

540
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
I don't plan to go back to school for now,

541
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,720
because I need a break.

542
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm actively participating in various charity events

543
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,040
while trying to figure out

544
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,240
what all my previous hard work

545
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,080
was really for.

546
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,280
Now I'm a

547
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,600
volunteer at the Love Reading Foundation,

548
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,480
and based on what I learned abroad about

549
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,400
the concept of mobile libraries,

550
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
I proposed my own new project

551
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,730
which received support from the foundation.

552
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Mobile libraries

553
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
involve regularly bringing books to

554
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
small villages without libraries.

555
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,240
This way, local people can easily

556
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
borrow books,

557
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,440
making traditional libraries mobile.

558
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,580
Which book would you like to read?

559
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,400
I want to read them all.

560
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I want this one.

561
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,680
You want this one?

562
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,120
Okay, what's your name?

563
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,120
I want this book.

564
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,000
Sure, you can take it.

565
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,200
The mobile library project in rural areas

566
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,240
has touched us deeply

567
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,600
and fulfilled the needs of villagers,

568
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,200
especially children's thirst for knowledge.

569
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,080
For the next month,

570
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,240
our Love Reading mobile library

571
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,360
will remain here in Fushan Village.

572
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,120
I hope everyone will actively use it,

573
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,840
and if you have any questions,

574
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,080
please feel free to come talk to me anytime.

575
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,400
Of course, we will also

576
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,460
regularly replace and add new books.

577
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,880
I hope this will

578
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,360
make reading more convenient for you all

579
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,690
and that everyone will enjoy our library.

580
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,320
Thank you, everyone.

581
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,760
After Sister Xu Wei returned to China, she led the final push,

582
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,650
and our research project finally succeeded.

583
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,760
I received this good news while I was in the village.

584
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,040
And at this moment,

585
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,160
I can proudly say

586
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,200
that I share this same sense of fulfillment.

587
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,440
I'm happy for her, and she has given me her blessings too.

588
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,440
I made a new photo album for Teacher Zhuo.

589
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,740
The album no longer shows Gu Nian holding certificates and trophies,

590
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,480
but instead shows me sweating in the sunshine,

591
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,920
surrounded by all kinds of laughter.

592
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,140
Hey beautiful,

593
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,320
need a ride?

594
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,800
Sure, Professor Zhuo.

595
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,220
Did you miss me?

596
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,280
Of course.

597
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,120
What's all that in the back?

598
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,320
Just books.

599
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,280
That's a lot of books.

600
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,120
As soon as I heard

601
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,280
you were joining the mobile library project,

602
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,480
I signed up as a volunteer

603
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,940
hoping to give you some specific advice.

604
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,800
But you didn't expect

605
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,040
that I'd come to England, did you?

606
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,000
Isn't it a huge surprise?

607
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,560
Perfect timing.

608
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,080
That's not all.

609
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I've already applied to universities here in England

610
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,140
and I'm about to submit my documents.

611
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,120
Gu Nian.

612
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,600
No.

613
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,760
Really?

614
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,720
You're actually coming to study in England?

615
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,680
Of course it's true.

616
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,760
We're so far apart,

617
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,900
what if you fall for someone else?

618
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,660
Alright, let's go.

619
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,840
By the way, Gu Nian, have you chosen a school yet?

620
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Have you decided which university?

621
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,010
Is your personal statement ready?

622
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,840
Gu Nian,

623
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,560
British applications are very different from American ones.

624
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,160
The formats are completely different.

625
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,480
You should have told me earlier.

626
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
I should be helping you with this.

627
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,020
When is the submission deadline?

628
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,560
Professor Zhuo, you don't need to worry about my application anymore.

629
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,720
I'm already experienced in writing personal statements,

630
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,380
I can handle as many as needed.

631
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,760
Hello

632
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,080
Miss Duocai.

633
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,650
Professor Zhuo,

634
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,880
After everything that's happened,

635
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,960
I suddenly realized that rankings

636
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,620
and getting A's don't matter,

637
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,490
because they can't give me true fulfillment.

638
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,320
This time I came back to work on the mobile library project,

639
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,050
helping many people around me,

640
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,920
and this satisfaction is something grades can never replace.

641
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,640
So?

642
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,320
So after graduation, I want to return to China

643
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,960
to do more meaningful things.

644
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,760
What about me?

645
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
You'll come back with me, of course.

646
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,440
Camera C
