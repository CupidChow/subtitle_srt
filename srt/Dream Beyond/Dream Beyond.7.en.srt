1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,120
It seems after teaching at St. Helen's for so long

2
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,520
I've somewhat forgotten my British accent.

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
The assignment I gave you last time

4
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
was to write a story about a young girl,

5
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
but I received a ghost story instead.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,000
It's supposed to be about a girl, not a ghost story.

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, now that I understand everyone's level

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,060
I can adjust the course accordingly.

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,800
I can't believe I made such a basic mistake with the accent.

10
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Freshmen usually don't choose professors with accents,

11
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
didn't anyone tell you that?

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,810
No, they didn't.

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
Besides, how am I supposed to know

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
which professors have accents and which don't?

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,920
Let me see your schedule.

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
This one and that one both have heavy accents.

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,400
Since you've just started and can still drop classes,

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
you should drop these immediately.

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,840
Peterson.

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,320
These two professors are really good,

21
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,600
they speak clearly,

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,880
have flexible teaching methods,

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,210
switch to them instead.

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,800
You're a master at this.

25
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,960
Just speaking from experience.

26
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,960
This weekend, the Chinese Students Association is organizing a fall outing,

27
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
and they hope everyone will attend.

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
What's wrong?

29
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,820
The Chinese Students Association is having a fall outing with a barbecue this weekend.

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,200
It's just the same old eating and drinking routine.

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Why do you dislike the Chinese Students Association so much?

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
It's a waste of time,

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
and there's nothing new about it.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,720
That's true.

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,600
It's always the same issues over and over.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,320
Freshman anxiety,

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,320
homesickness,

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
where to buy the cheapest used books,

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,960
which supermarket offers better deals,

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
there's definitely nothing fresh about it.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,320
So,

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,560
I'd rather use that time

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,890
to practice my English listening skills.

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
English speaking and listening depend on the environment,

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
not just studying by yourself

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
in isolation.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,600
Teacher Zhuo, you must have some solution.

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
You should join some authentic

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,400
American campus clubs.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
Is that the only way?

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,200
Participating in club activities

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,530
will greatly benefit your future resume,

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,840
a resume without club experience lacks highlights,

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,940
you've learned this the hard way.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,920
You sound just like Huang Xin'er.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
It's just that I really don't want

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,360
to waste time on this,

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,680
unless there's a club that allows me to participate

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,399
without wasting my time and energy.

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,720
There is.

61
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,040
What is it?

62
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,100
In your dreams.

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,620
Why are you still here?

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Community service lasts a month.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,140
How did you get off so quickly?

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,500
I caught someone breaking the rules.

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
Makes sense.

68
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,570
You're so lucky.

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
Goodbye.

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,159
Bye.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,360
You're from the Meditation Club, right?

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Yes, I'm the president of the Meditation Club.

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,240
Can I come visit sometime?

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,520
Of course, you're welcome anytime.

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Could I come by later today?

76
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,280
Sure, we'll meet at 5:45 PM

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,960
in the school backyard,

78
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,560
under the seventh tree counting from the left.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
Great, see you later.

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Goodbye.

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,800
Peter.

82
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,920
You're here.

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,440
Welcome to the Meditation Club.

84
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,080
Not many people showed up.

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
This is everyone, we all came.

86
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
Just three people,

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,880
can three people even be called a club?

88
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Of course. Disappointed?

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,040
No, no.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Do you always meet outdoors?

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,140
The location doesn't matter.

92
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,000
Although it seems like we're not doing anything,

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
we're actually using meditation

94
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,530
to communicate with everything in the universe.

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,400
He left.

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
He finished his meditation.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
Doesn't he say goodbye?

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,000
We don't communicate through words,

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,920
but through here.

100
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,440
If I join the club,

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,360
will I just come here to meditate?

102
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,840
Yes, meditation and communication.

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,680
Okay, I'll join.

104
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,600
Really.

105
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,760
Good.

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Then close your eyes.

107
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
Why?

108
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
Trust me,

109
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,840
close your eyes.

110
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,560
Okay.

111
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,240
Good.

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,600
Your spirit tells me

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,080
that you're pure and have great potential,

114
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,960
but you need to keep working on yourself.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
That's nice.

116
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,680
Club dues are $30 per semester.

117
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,080
Okay.

118
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,360
Jeni, I don't have enough money.

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,800
Ieni, I don't have enough.

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,260
I don't have enough money.

121
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
$10 is also acceptable.

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,320
Pay now.

123
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
Okay.

124
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Good.

125
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,160
Welcome to the club.

126
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
I finally joined an organization.

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Yes.

128
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,280
Meditation performance in a stadium with thousands of people.

129
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
That's insane.

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,800
This

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,400
isn't some kind of cult, is it?

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,280
What's this Meditation Club?

133
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,810
I've never even heard of it.

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,120
Why would you join such an obscure club?

135
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
Because it meets all my requirements.

136
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
I can be in a club and study at the same time,

137
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,880
and most importantly, after studying,

138
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,210
I can also get some rest.

139
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,440
Nian Nian,

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,080
this headband is so poorly made,

141
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,679
you can tell it's cheap.

142
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
It's just a symbol.

143
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Alright.

144
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,400
Are you going to attend the club activities later?

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm going tomorrow night.

146
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Nian Nian,

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,320
if you ever want to switch to a different club,

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,160
you can tell me.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,360
I can help you connect with other clubs.

150
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
Stop eating.

151
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,440
No, listen,

152
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm already part of the Meditation Club.

153
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm very loyal.

154
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,840
You're here.

155
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,280
Why are we indoors today?

156
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't mind these external factors,

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,480
you can meditate anywhere.

158
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,000
Is this our activity room?

159
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,960
No, this is a storage room,

160
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,080
but we can use it in the evenings.

161
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,570
Come, sit next to me.

162
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,640
Okay, thank you.

163
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,600
Sit beside me,

164
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
I'll teach you how to meditate,

165
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
we'll take it step by step.

166
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
Thank you.

167
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,240
Cross your legs like this, right,

168
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,840
then place your hands on your knees like this.

169
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,540
What should I think about?

170
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,320
First step is to relax and clear your mind.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,860
Look, you're doing it naturally.

172
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,000
Now close your eyes.

173
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,840
Take a deep breath.

174
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,720
Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.

175
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,120
You need to completely empty yourself,

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,160
and respond to the call of nature.

177
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,720
Hey you! Where are you?

178
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,800
Over here.

179
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,400
Oh right, you're going to New York tomorrow?

180
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,120
Yes.

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
I mean, who does that,

182
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
going to your ex's wedding

183
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,960
after you've already broken up?

184
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,080
You're like the model ex-boyfriend.

185
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,240
Just think of it as me attending

186
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,300
a friend and sister's wedding, okay?

187
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,640
Fine.

188
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,680
Don't you feel even a little sad inside?

189
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,160
Not even the tiniest bit?

190
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,280
Not at all.

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,530
That's impossible,

192
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,620
after so many years together,

193
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,500
how can you just forget like that?

194
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,380
Don't compare yourself to me.

195
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,480
I can let go of things too, okay?

196
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,800
Alright, enough about me,

197
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,520
how long are you planning to stay in New York?

198
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,120
Why?

199
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
When you're alone in New York,

200
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,200
late at night, lying awake in bed,

201
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
feel free to hit me up.

202
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Weirdo,

203
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,960
don't you dare bother me.

204
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,760
I absolutely must bother you.

205
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Zhuo Peng.

206
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
I thought you wouldn't come.

207
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,920
On such an important day,

208
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,180
how could I not be here?

209
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,240
Thank you.

210
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
How have you been lately?

211
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
Pretty good. You?

212
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,500
I'm doing well too.

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,280
It's been a long time, Zhuopeng.

214
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Teacher Lin,

215
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,240
how are you? How's your health?

216
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,800
Good, eating and sleeping well.

217
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,440
America is just too far away.

218
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,800
When will we meet again?

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Teacher Lin, we've just met

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,200
and you're already talking about parting.

221
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,920
Dad.

222
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,520
I only found out when I came to America

223
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,720
about you two.

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,530
I'm sorry, Teacher Lin.

225
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,160
You're not the one who should apologize.

226
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,280
Let's go inside.

227
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,920
Zhuopeng, I made some tea for you.

228
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,480
Thanks.

229
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,600
Thank you for speaking up for me just now.

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
I was just telling the truth.

231
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,480
I've always told my dad

232
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,160
that Old Jiang really treats me well,

233
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,890
but he just doesn't believe it.

234
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,520
Take it slow.

235
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,560
My dad really likes you.

236
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,280
Except for you,

237
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
he wouldn't be satisfied with anyone I marry.

238
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,280
Yes and no.

239
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,210
What do you mean?

240
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
It's true that whoever you marry,

241
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
he won't be satisfied.

242
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,240
But it's not just except for me.

243
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,370
Even if you marry me,

244
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
he'll still find fault with me.

245
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,440
After your mother passed away,

246
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,880
you became Professor Lin's most precious treasure.

247
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
You're the apple of his eye.

248
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,360
No matter who he gives you to,

249
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,720
he won't feel at ease.

250
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,450
But everything he says is really hurtful.

251
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,280
He says at such a busy time,

252
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,960
with Old Jiang away,

253
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm left with all the work.

254
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
But he really does have important business to discuss,

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,680
and I was the one who insisted he go.

256
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,340
But my dad doesn't care at all.

257
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,880
He has no idea

258
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,010
how much pressure I'm under right now.

259
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,680
You're preparing to get married,

260
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,560
and you want everyone's approval and blessing.

261
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,600
You're afraid of not doing things right,

262
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,660
so it's natural that you're nervous.

263
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,280
But Professor Lin,

264
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,120
he also has to face the reality

265
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,380
of giving his daughter away in marriage.

266
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,080
He's terrified you won't be happy.

267
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,400
He's worried you're making the wrong decision,

268
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,520
so his anxiety is understandable too.

269
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,200
Right?

270
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
Don't be confused by how it's expressed.

271
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
Both of you want the same thing.

272
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,080
You both hope this marriage

273
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,240
will be happy and beautiful.

274
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,760
Don't be angry anymore.

275
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,960
Professor Lin is waiting for us to play cards.

276
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,520
Don't make it too obvious when you lose later.

277
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,200
What?

278
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
Did I?

279
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,330
You obviously lose every time.

280
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,120
That's not fair.

281
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,240
I think my acting is pretty good.

282
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
Are you done with your homework?

283
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,680
Yes.

284
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,520
How's your meditation going lately?

285
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,760
Do you feel more relaxed and happy?

286
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,760
Since you asked,

287
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,400
I don't seem to get sleepy in class anymore,

288
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,920
probably because nature has healed me.

289
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,160
Would you like to go see a movie with me?

290
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,960
What?

291
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,530
Let's go see a movie together tonight.

292
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,520
But I have to do my homework tonight.

293
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,200
No problem, maybe next time then.

294
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,320
Peter.

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,640
What is it?

296
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,119
Would you like to

297
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,720
study with me at the café tonight?

298
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,079
Sure, I'd love to.

299
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,160
Are you bored?

300
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,640
No, no, I'm fine.

301
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,280
I think I'll be a while longer.

302
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280
No problem, I can wait for you.

303
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,640
I have time.

304
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,960
Okay, I'm going back to do my homework then.

305
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,320
Alright.

306
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,520
Sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,880
This is typical freshman life.

308
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
I was the same way in my first year.

309
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,160
It gets much easier by junior year.

310
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,960
Will you be at the library tomorrow too?

311
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,480
Are you going?

312
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,400
Yes, I am.

313
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,040
Perfect. After we leave the library,

314
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,970
we can grab dinner and then go to the meditation club.

315
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Sounds good to me.

316
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,880
Goodbye.

317
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,920
Goodbye.

318
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Nian Nian, you're back just in time.

319
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Come here and draw a card.

320
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
Do you know how to read tarot cards?

321
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,400
I just learned. Here, take them.

322
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Shuffle them three times.

323
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Three times?

324
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,960
One, two, three.

325
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,400
Good. Now give them to me.

326
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,280
Here. What's next?

327
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Draw one card.

328
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,600
Any one?

329
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,560
Nian Nian.

330
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,090
Your love star is in motion.

331
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,960
Isn't this supposed to be tarot?

332
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,480
Why are you using fortune-telling terms now?

333
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,040
No, really.

334
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,480
This card represents love.

335
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,410
Your romance has already arrived.

336
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,480
Nian Nian, what did you do tonight?

337
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,560
Did you go to study hall or meditation?

338
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,320
No meditation tonight.

339
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,960
But there will be tomorrow night.

340
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
Is that meditation club of yours actually any fun?

341
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
The meditation club?

342
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
It feels really good.

343
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,000
I think I've found my happiness.

344
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,760
Happiness? More than getting top scores?

345
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
It's a different kind of happiness.

346
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,560
Wearing white pants.

347
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,720
At his age,

348
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,680
it's not easy to stay in such good shape.

349
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,280
Dad, I told you that seeing him in person

350
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,000
would definitely feel different.

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
People need to spend time together to really connect.

352
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,730
But the question is,

353
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
how do we address our relationship?

354
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,200
He's almost 50, right?

355
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,280
If he calls me dad, it gives me the creeps.

356
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,530
Calling me big brother wouldn't be right either.

357
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,040
Dad, don't you enjoy drinking?

358
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,920
This was shipped from a French winery

359
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,980
specially for you.

360
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
Is that so?

361
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,400
But I prefer baijiu.

362
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,680
I can't drink this foreign stuff.

363
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,920
Dad, this is good wine. Try it,

364
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
you might like it.

365
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,000
At my age,

366
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,080
what I like and don't like

367
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
is already set in stone. Can't change it.

368
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,320
Dad, you'll like this one.

369
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,680
How do you have this?

370
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
Didn't you say our dad likes

371
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
strong baijiu?

372
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,260
I bought it in advance,

373
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,980
thinking that when Dad comes to stay,

374
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,320
he could enjoy a few drinks now and then.

375
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,960
Dad, let me pour you some.

376
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,720
Zhuopeng, would you like some too?

378
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,400
Sure,

379
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll have a drink with Teacher Lin.

380
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,320
Here.

381
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,240
Dad, I proposed to Lin Yao.

382
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,840
I should have come in person to ask for her hand

383
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,100
and get your approval,

384
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,720
but various matters delayed it until today.

385
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,440
Let me offer you a drink and apologize.

386
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,200
If you had come to ask formally,

387
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,240
this marriage might not have happened at all.

388
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,480
Let me drink first, bottoms up as a sign of respect.

389
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,400
My daughter has grown up

390
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,240
and has her own ideas.

391
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
As her father,

392
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,400
I've raised her to be healthy and strong,

393
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,970
given her an education,

394
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
and done right by her late mother.

395
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,080
I've fulfilled my responsibilities.

396
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,160
I can't control everything else anymore,

397
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,050
interfere too much and I'll just be resented.

398
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,700
But regarding your marriage,

399
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,160
if I said I had no opinions at all,

400
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,000
that wouldn't be honest.

401
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,240
But my ideas compared to hers...

402
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Of course her opinion matters more,

403
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,920
after all, it's her life to live.

404
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,720
Lin Yao,

405
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,280
there's one thing you need to be clear about,

406
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
you must not have any regrets.

407
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,280
I understand.

408
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,800
Your ideal son-in-law is Zhuo Peng.

409
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,180
Lin Yao has known Zhuo Peng since childhood.

410
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,920
In Lin Yao's life,

411
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,880
he has an irreplaceable presence.

412
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
It's because of their past together

413
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,560
that Lin Yao has become who she is today.

414
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
Their history together

415
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,410
is something I cannot and will never replace.

416
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
If I were just a bystander,

417
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,770
I would be just like you all,

418
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,200
hoping this perfect couple would end up together,

419
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,080
with a fairy tale ending.

420
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,880
But the story between Lin Yao and me

421
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,880
happened in reality.

422
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,000
And I don't believe our relationship

423
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,860
is anything less than beautiful.

424
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,680
Indeed, in the eyes of others,

425
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
how Lin Yao and I began

426
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,770
might seem somewhat unconventional.

427
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,280
But it was all my fault,

428
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,880
I was the one who pursued Lin Yao relentlessly.

429
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,440
Being able to win her heart and marry her

430
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,840
is my greatest blessing.

431
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,040
I'd like to toast to Teacher Lin and Zhuopeng,

432
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,760
thank you for taking such good care of Lin Yao.

433
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,960
I will cherish her dearly.

434
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,120
Strong liquor shouldn't be drunk too quickly,

435
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,480
sipping slowly allows its spiciness

436
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,410
to gradually turn into sweetness.

437
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
Let's eat.

438
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,520
Here.

439
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Then you lost.

440
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,720
Zhuo Peng.

441
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,760
What do you think of this Mr. Jiang?

442
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
He seems pretty good in every way.

443
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
He's very calm and composed,

444
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,000
quite charming as a successful man.

445
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,640
I don't agree.

446
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,080
He was so arrogant during dinner.

447
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,920
Really? I didn't notice,

448
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,050
he seemed fine to me.

449
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,040
Fine?

450
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,200
Yes, on the surface he's perfect,

451
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,610
and speaks without leaving any openings.

452
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,240
But his entire performance

453
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,080
was full of self-importance,

454
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,440
that subtle sense of oppression.

455
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,840
Didn't you feel it?

456
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,480
Like how he doesn't believe

457
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,280
their relationship is beautiful.

458
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,800
He wrapped it all up in roundabout nonsense.

459
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,920
The maturity and calculation that comes with his age

460
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,860
are two sides of the same coin.

461
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Lin Yao with him is just a young woman with an older man.

462
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,690
Either she'll be put on a pedestal,

463
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,120
pampered and indulged everywhere,

464
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,960
with everything revolving around her.

465
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,600
Or it'll be a bottomless abyss,

466
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,840
where anything could happen.

467
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,600
Lin Yao, that girl,

468
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,080
can't handle him.

469
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Dad, Zhuo Peng, have some fruit.

470
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,400
Teacher Lin,

471
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,720
what we just talked about should stay between us,

472
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
don't tell Lin Yao.

473
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,360
I'd like to tell her,

474
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,240
but would she even listen?

475
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,240
What's up?

476
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Let's go eat.

477
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,040
Right now?

478
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,000
I have something urgent to do.

479
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,460
I'm not finished here yet.

480
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,960
You've already been interrupted,

481
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,080
can you really pick up where you left off?

482
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Let's go then.

483
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,920
Aren't you going to tell them?

484
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
In our meditation club, we come and go as we please.

485
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,400
We don't rely on words,

486
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,240
we rely on this.

487
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,280
Impressive. Let's go.

488
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,480
Since you joined the meditation club,

489
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
your appetite has improved so much?

490
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,960
To be honest, meditation

491
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,880
really takes a lot of energy.

492
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,760
Don't eat so quickly then,

493
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
nobody's going to steal your food.

494
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,880
It's not that. What if the task you give me

495
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,920
is something I can't accomplish,

496
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,180
then I won't get to eat this steak, right?

497
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,720
Listening to recordings again?

498
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,680
This is the last time,

499
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,140
really the very last time.

500
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,160
I only know a little bit about this.

501
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,440
If you can help me complete this exhibition,

502
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,800
then my chances of becoming vice president

503
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,130
will greatly increase.

504
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,220
You want me to succeed too, right?

505
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,440
Plus one month of steak lunches.

506
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Please?

507
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,640
Take it.

508
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
I'm such a pushover for food.

509
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,760
Phone.

510
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,600
Right.

511
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,360
My uncle is a St. Helen's alumnus.

512
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
Nine paratroopers came from his class.

513
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,480
I heard from him they're planning a reunion,

514
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,770
so maybe we could use that as our theme.

515
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,300
Paratroopers? That sounds awesome.

516
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
Great, then it's decided.

517
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,480
Our special guests will be the paratroopers

518
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,880
who graduated from our school 40 years ago.

519
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,480
Let me be clear.

520
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,680
I'm just making educated guesses here.

521
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
I think they said...

522
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,200
The nine guests invited to this exhibition

523
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,080
graduated from here 40 years ago,

524
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
they were paratroopers.

525
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,800
Paratroopers?

526
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,400
Yes.

527
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,320
This is their first reunion

528
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
after 40 years since graduation.

529
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,120
So this exhibition aims to show

530
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,000
them as they were in their youth,

531
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,660
and help more people understand paratroopers.

532
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,520
You really know a lot.

533
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,640
When I hear unfamiliar terms,

534
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,080
I get completely lost.

535
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,280
There were indeed some uncommon terms.

536
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,200
I don't know much about airborne troops.

537
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,440
But Gu Nian,

538
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,200
you're such a bookworm,

539
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,930
could you tell me more about it?

540
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
I don't know much either.

541
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,520
If that doesn't work,

542
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,480
why don't you check some materials at the library?

543
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,920
I'd like to go to the library,

544
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,280
but I don't have time.

545
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,920
Then try to find inspiration from your area of expertise.

546
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,840
For example, you like watching movies, right?

547
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,080
There was a Korean movie called

548
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,960
Miss Granny,

549
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
about an elderly woman

550
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,200
who goes back to her youth and lives it all over again.

551
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
You could try this angle.

552
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,080
Airborne troops returning to their twenties.

553
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,680
Exactly,

554
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
think about when they were twenty,

555
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,800
it was the late 60s and early 70s,

556
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,760
when the hippie movement was popular in America.

557
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,760
Could you write down the key points? I'm afraid I'll forget.

558
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Sure, let me help.

559
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,720
That's right.

560
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Well...

561
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,520
I have a brilliant concept for this event,

562
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,440
the exhibition should revolve around music and films

563
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,800
to inspire the 'Back to Your Twenties' theme.

564
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,560
From Elvis Presley to Bob Dylan,

565
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,440
John Lennon to The Beatles.

566
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,320
We can look for movie posters,

567
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,160
like Cleopatra,

568
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
The Sound of Music,

569
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,600
Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate.

570
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,520
That's an excellent approach. I love it.

571
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,480
Ivy, I'll leave the design to you.

572
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,640
Okay.

573
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,800
But you know,

574
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,760
we'll need a large venue for this.

575
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,880
Our budget is only $4,000,

576
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,160
and the venues around here

577
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,420
cost at least $10,000.

578
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,000
I have an idea for a fundraising event

579
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,440
if we create some artwork featuring veterans

580
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,680
and then sell them for charity.

581
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,480
That's a great idea

582
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,880
but you might not have enough time on your own

583
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,480
so I hope everyone can contribute their talents.

584
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,400
Contribute talents.

585
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,920
Ivy

586
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,280
do you have any thoughts?

587
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,880
Oh right, I'm sorry, I forgot

588
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,960
this is Ella, Nathan, and Max

589
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,560
they're all visual arts students

590
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,640
I hope you can work together

591
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,600
and develop your ideas.

592
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,760
Sounds good

593
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,400
maybe I can learn something new.

594
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,320
Hello, Max.

595
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,960
Hello, Nathan.

596
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,120
Hello, Ella.

597
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,480
Oh right, I forgot

598
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,640
Ivy also brought us

599
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,840
some Cantonese dim sum today,

600
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,880
and I hope everyone will try some this time.

601
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,080
Go grab one, anything.

602
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Come, this way.

603
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,200
Take a pork roll

604
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,040
and experience a more diverse culture.

605
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,840
Come on, everyone.

606
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,280
Let me help you with these plates.

607
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,320
Thank you, Ivy.

608
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,920
Coffee.

609
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,560
She seems like a completely different person today.

610
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,200
They say Chinese people are clever and resourceful.

611
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,840
I bet you five dollars

612
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
it's not her idea.

613
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,480
Last time she couldn't even understand what we were saying,

614
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,160
and now she's suddenly eloquent.

615
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,640
What do you think, Max?

616
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,720
Your real talent

617
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,250
might not be in those areas.

618
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,000
Mom, what do you mean?

619
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,520
Use your strengths!

620
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,050
This is your advantage,

621
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,320
nothing works faster

622
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,850
or more directly than this.

623
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,400
Mom,

624
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,080
I usually just treat people to afternoon tea,

625
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,520
isn't giving money directly a bit inappropriate?

626
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,080
That's why I say you're naive.

627
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,480
If you can quickly solve their problems,

628
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,080
even the foreigners will look at you with newfound respect.

629
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,639
Be good and take this.

630
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
Do you have a lot of homework?

631
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,840
Yes, always a lot.

632
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,440
If you have a lot of homework,

633
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,040
you don't have to rush over here,

634
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,960
don't push yourself too hard.

635
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,080
But I don't want to miss club activities.

636
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,720
Even if you're physically here,

637
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,560
your mind is elsewhere.

638
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm thinking about the Meditation Club too.

639
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,400
You know what,

640
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm planning to apply for club funding from the school,

641
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,880
and I need to fill out

642
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,960
a form for each member.

643
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
I don't think I know

644
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
which city in China you're from?

645
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,520
Beijing.

646
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,920
Oh, Beijing.

647
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,000
Is that the capital?

648
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
Or is Shanghai the capital?

649
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
It's Beijing.

650
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,280
Okay, though submitting it might not even help.

651
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,800
But we have to at least try.

652
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
If we can get the funding,

653
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,880
we can advertise to recruit new members.

654
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,600
If by the end of this semester

655
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,530
we could increase to 10 members, that would be great.

656
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,360
I have class tonight,

657
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,320
so I won't be going to the library.

658
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,600
Okay.

659
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,410
What about tomorrow night?

660
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,880
No class tomorrow night.

661
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,680
Want to see a movie?

662
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,360
Maybe on the weekend.

663
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,360
Last weekend you said this week.

664
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,200
Movies are better on weekends,

665
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,680
so can we go to the library tomorrow?

666
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,160
Fine.

667
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,920
What were you saying you wanted to do earlier?

668
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,560
I mean we need to fill out forms for club members.

669
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,730
You can take them to the library to work on.

670
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,640
See you at the library tomorrow night. It's a deal.

671
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,080
Alright then, deal.

672
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,200
Bye.

673
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,880
Bye.

674
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,120
Hi, Peter.

675
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,040
Hi.

676
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,120
Come on.

677
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,120
Didn't you say you had something to do?

678
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,000
All done.

679
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,560
Go read something.

680
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,920
Okay, I'll go read something.

681
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,840
Good.

682
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,240
Where did you go?

683
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,040
You were studying so hard, so I left with my friends.

684
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,570
Let's meet up another time.

685
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,440
Okay.

686
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,560
So beautiful!

687
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
How is it? Satisfied?

688
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,680
Of course I'm satisfied!

689
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,360
You always make me look the best.

690
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,520
What can I do? I've got a troublemaker like you as a friend.

691
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,320
Well, I wanted the Upper East Side's

692
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,760
most up-and-coming stylist

693
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,220
to do my styling, you know.

694
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,500
Seems like something's missing.

695
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,600
Try this flirty coral pink.

696
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,280
This... this color is too bright.

697
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,680
Zhenghao won't like it.

698
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,400
Says who? Your husband will definitely love it.

699
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,400
This color is very sexy.

700
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,530
When he sees you wearing it, he'll definitely say

701
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,960
he has an urge to kiss you.

702
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,920
He would never say that.

703
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,320
He's very conservative.

704
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,360
Trust me.

705
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Fine.

706
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Honey.

707
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
Darling.

708
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,680
You look gorgeous.

709
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,600
New lipstick?

710
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,040
Does it look good? Is it too much?

711
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,640
It looks great. The color is very sexy.

712
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,120
When I look at you, I just want to kiss you.

713
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,660
I haven't introduced you yet.

714
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,480
This is Jiang Zhenghao, my husband.

715
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,440
Chen Lili, the stylist I hired.

716
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,120
Hello.

717
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,200
Please, have a seat over here.

718
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,500
Do you know each other?

719
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,760
Yes.

720
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,360
That's impossible, we don't know each other.

721
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,600
How could we possibly know each other?

722
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,800
How would I ever get the chance to meet someone like Mr. Jiang,

723
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,240
such a high-class eligible bachelor.
