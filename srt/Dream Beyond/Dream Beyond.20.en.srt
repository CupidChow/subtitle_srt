1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
Back in 2008, my cousin's friend

2
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800
was working here.

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,800
Then he took leave to visit family in China,

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,330
and just as he arrived home,

5
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,840
the company started layoffs and fired him.

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
The problem was

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,220
this guy had already bought a house here.

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,920
So he did everything possible

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
to come back and sell the house,

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
then fled back to China in a panic.

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,320
Without a green card,

12
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,560
you can't really feel secure

13
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,040
or settled living here.

14
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,720
And with the current immigration policies,

15
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
even your own parents aren't considered immediate family,

16
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,080
so you can't apply for family-based immigration.

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,720
Who knows what policies they'll come up with next?

18
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,919
Without a green card,

19
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,360
it's like having a sword hanging over your head.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,680
You never know when it might suddenly drop

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,400
and come crashing down on you.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,930
You're scaring me to death,

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,320
can we change the subject?

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,920
No need, it's time for work anyway.

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
Don't cook dinner for me tonight, I won't be back.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,980
Is that all you're eating?

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't forget your lunch.

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,840
I made soup for you today.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,720
Hey,

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,120
remember to definitely

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,880
heat up the soup before drinking it.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,120
Got it!

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm off now.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
Bye-bye.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
I've reviewed the statistical data

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,840
from this period again

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,100
and found some errors.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm sorry, senior.

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,320
I wasn't thorough enough when verifying.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,040
Jiaming,

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,000
you've always been meticulous with your work,

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,160
but these are all very basic mistakes.

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,010
It won't happen again, senior.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,170
These seemingly minor errors.

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,760
but it could affect the judgment and results of the entire experiment.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,960
For this experiment,

47
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,440
I've been working late for so long, senior.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
Trust me, I'll be more careful.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,480
I might be going through a fatigue phase lately,

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,690
just a bit tired.

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
But for the sake of ultimate success,

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
all these tedious and complicated processes,

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
we must grit our teeth and get through them.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Does the school have any results from the investigation on Cui Fengjun?

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,600
So Professor Chris asked to see you,

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
is it about reinstating you?

57
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,840
No.

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,520
He recommended that I write

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,320
a psychology column for a youth magazine to popularize the subject.

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
He's probably worried I'll be unemployed all day

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
and develop psychological issues.

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,960
Even though we know the truth,

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
there's nothing we can do about it,

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,080
and that feeling is just so painful.

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,380
We can't rush this.

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
Are you really not worried at all?

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,240
Compared to my own situation,

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm more concerned about Xu Wei.

69
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,680
Should we go talk to her then?

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
What are you two plotting together now,

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
is there some gossip?

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
What gossip could we possibly have?

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,860
You guys don't have it,

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
but I do.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,730
This time Xu Wei has really become famous across the entire campus.

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,320
So you already know about it.

77
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,240
So you all know too.

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
Where did you hear about it?

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,440
On the official website.

80
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,700
The official website?

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,800
Wait, Xiang Nongchao,

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,040
be more specific. What are you talking about?

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,400
It's about Xu Wei making it onto

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,480
the associate professor candidate list,

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,600
the only Asian

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,200
and the only female in the entire school.

87
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,840
Don't you think we should ask her to treat us to dinner?

88
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,360
Let's go find her and have her treat us to dinner.

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I just...

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,360
Professor.

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
What are you thinking about?

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,370
What's on your mind?

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
I should be thinking about what you're thinking.

94
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,920
Have you reached any conclusions?

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,650
What I've come up with isn't really a conclusion.

96
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,780
Mine is just speculation as well.

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,440
You go first.

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,920
Cui Fengjun said that

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,000
David threatened him about his academic future

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,280
to keep him quiet.

101
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,800
So he was facing a double threat:

102
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,240
first, physical violence,

103
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,100
and second, his academic future.

104
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,080
Yes.

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,760
Could Xu Wei be like Cui Fengjun,

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,840
concerned about her academic interests?

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
Xu Wei's research abilities are quite strong.

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
I certainly believe that.

109
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,240
I... you...

110
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,760
You're not questioning her motives for getting married, are you?

111
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,200
I certainly hope she's not that kind of person.

112
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,860
I don't believe she is either.

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,760
Well, dinner's not happening.

114
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
Old Wu has summoned me again

115
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
to do his grunt work.

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
You two keep talking.

117
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Oh, right,

118
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,040
please pass on my congratulations to Xu Wei.

119
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm off.

120
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
Look at these,

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,160
I think there are some technical issues with the data analysis

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,090
that prevent us from moving smoothly into phase two.

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,080
There are indeed some minor issues,

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,140
but nobody's perfect.

125
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Jiaming has been your assistant for a long time,

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
and there have never been any problems,

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,200
but it seems with me...

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
Jiaming is a very meticulous person,

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,370
that's why we have him handle important data.

130
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm confident he can fix this,

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
you should be more patient with him.

132
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,130
Trust your fellow Chinese.

133
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
All right.

134
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,600
Maybe he's got something on his mind lately.

135
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Don't worry.

136
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
I'll talk to Jiaming later if I get the chance.

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,810
You don't need to worry about this.

138
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,200
What are your plans after work tonight?

139
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,320
Why don't you come with me to Bell's

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,040
to celebrate you making it onto the associate professor shortlist?

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,360
Have a little celebration.

142
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,720
But it's not confirmed yet, is it?

143
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
That's true.

144
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,840
Well then, I'll head off first.

145
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,960
You should go home early too, okay?

146
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
Get some rest and don't overwork yourself.

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Hi, Guoyang.

148
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Hi, Lina.

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,730
You're back so soon.

150
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,840
I came back early

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,240
to process my transfer paperwork.

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
What? Transfer?

153
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Yeah, I didn't expect it either.

154
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,200
I guess it's a good opportunity for newcomers to gain experience.

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,880
Alright,

156
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
see you later.

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Excuse me.

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Come in.

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,820
Have a seat.

160
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,320
Thank you.

161
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,320
Guo Yang, I called you here today to tell you

162
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,200
some unfortunate news.

163
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,520
The company's international assignment position has been given to someone else,

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,560
to Linna.

165
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Yes.

166
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,360
I'd like to know if there are any other opportunities.

167
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
There's only one overseas position available each year,

168
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,000
as you well know.

169
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
I've always worked hard,

170
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,600
dedicated myself completely to the company,

171
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,840
and my performance has consistently been the best in the team,

172
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,080
you know that.

173
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,040
Yes, but Linna has just completed all the paperwork,

174
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
and this year's position has already been finalized.

175
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,720
But without this overseas assignment,

176
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,480
it will be difficult for me to stay in the US

177
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,340
until next year's visa issuance.

178
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,800
Can't you help me get another position?

179
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,040
Every year, the company's overseas positions are highly sought after,

180
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,680
with so many foreign employees fighting tooth and nail for them.

181
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
I know this result is disappointing for you,

182
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,360
but the decision is final.

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,480
But why? Why Linna?

184
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,720
How is she better than me?

185
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,280
This is a decision made after comprehensive consideration by the company.

186
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,640
This is the final result.

188
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
You work the most overtime in the company,

189
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,520
and your performance is the best in the team,

190
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,080
if the company doesn't keep you, who would they keep?

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
Why? Why Lina?

192
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,520
How is she better than me?

193
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,330
This is the decision made after the company's comprehensive evaluation.

194
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
I should have studied electrical engineering back then.

195
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,120
You're saying without a work visa now,

196
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,960
I can't submit my application,

197
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,960
and without submitting an application, I can't get a green card.

198
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,640
Without a green card,

199
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,360
you can't work here

200
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,620
with any sense of stability or security.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,280
Honey,

202
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,250
why are you home so late?

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
What's wrong?

204
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,540
Did you get news about the overseas assignment?

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,280
It's okay. Everything has a solution.

206
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,890
Don't try to comfort me.

207
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,320
We've overcome so many challenges already,

208
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,580
we can handle this too.

209
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,680
I failed.

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,060
The company gave the position to a newcomer,

211
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
a woman.

212
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,840
I heard the manager likes her.

213
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,680
It's really not my fault.

214
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
So, that's it then?

215
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,610
The company doesn't know how to value talent.

216
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,760
The reality is,

217
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
my visa has expired,

218
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,080
I can't stay here illegally anymore.

219
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,610
If I want to stay in America,

220
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,800
I'll have to apply for a course internship.

221
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,960
Get another degree,

222
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,400
survive on a student visa until next year,

223
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,540
then try for a work visa again.

224
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,100
Have you decided to apply?

225
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, we all have to face reality.

226
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,720
Today, I was wandering aimlessly

227
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,650
down the street,

228
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
watching people come and go.

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,010
The wind was strong, blowing right in my face.

230
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,040
I can't accept defeat like this.

231
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,080
There must be other options.

232
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,680
The overseas assignment path is blocked,

233
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,080
so I'll find another way.

234
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,010
I'm glad you're thinking that way.

235
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,320
I've gathered some information.

236
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Based on how well your major matches your profession,

237
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,960
I've done some preliminary screening

238
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,760
of schools and programs for you.

239
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,400
Take

240
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,680
a look.

241
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,980
I made some charts.

242
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,600
When did you do all this?

243
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,130
Just over the past few days.

244
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,360
What are you trying to do?

245
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,840
The results of my overseas assignment haven't even come out yet,

246
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
and you're already making these preparations.

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Are you jinxing me to fail?

248
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,720
I just wanted to help so that when you're feeling down,

249
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
you wouldn't have to worry about these things.

250
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,680
Don't you know you're bad luck yourself?

251
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,400
I didn't mean to bring you bad luck.

252
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
I was just trying to help.

253
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,360
Enough.

254
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,600
I don't care if you meant well or not,

255
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,520
things are what they are now.

256
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Just stop bothering me, okay?

257
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
Honey!

258
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,200
I specially made sandwiches and coffee this morning

259
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,530
for us to have together.

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Honey?

261
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm sorry

262
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,360
I shouldn't have taken my frustration out on you yesterday.

263
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
I was really upset inside

264
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,490
so I hope you won't take it personally.

265
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,680
Look.

266
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm looking at the school materials

267
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,240
that you organized for me yesterday.

268
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,770
You did such a thorough job.

269
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,200
Do you find it helpful?

270
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,600
Yes, absolutely!

271
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,200
Look, you've helped me analyze from degree value,

272
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
study duration, cost-effectiveness,

273
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,000
and even professional relevance

274
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
across so many dimensions,

275
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
making everything crystal clear.

276
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,320
So what do you think about this major?

277
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,200
Which one?

278
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,560
The optimal choice you selected for me,

279
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,620
finance, which aligns with business administration.

280
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,120
This school's finance program has quite a high ranking.

281
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,880
If you study diligently,

282
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,120
it would definitely be a form of self-improvement.

283
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,240
Plus, this school is close to your company,

284
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
so attending classes will be convenient.

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,530
It's just that the class hours are quite long.

286
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Calculating this way, your weekly work hours

287
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,760
would be less than 20 hours.

288
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,600
Don't worry, I'll discuss these matters with my company.

289
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
You don't need to worry about it.

290
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
If you really choose this major,

291
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,200
we can ask Sister Xu Wei

292
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,880
to help find a good professor

293
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,010
to write you a recommendation letter.

294
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,080
Actually, what you've chosen is pretty good too.

295
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,880
This was also part of my plan.

296
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:08,960
Thank you.

297
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
These are the interviews and research records

298
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
I collected when I returned to China.

299
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,280
If our research succeeds,

300
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,359
there will be a new medication that's affordable

301
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,520
and highly effective on the market.

302
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
Moreover, this medication

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,319
will be produced entirely by Chinese people ourselves.

304
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,640
We won't have to rely on

305
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,240
foreign pharmaceutical companies anymore.

306
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,880
This way, many patients will benefit,

307
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,360
and it will bring hope to many families

308
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,760
suffering from illness.

309
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,260
Please sit over there.

310
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,680
Okay.

311
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,920
Jiaming,

312
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,160
do you understand what I just said?

313
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,040
I understand.

314
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,180
Do you really understand?

315
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,840
Yes, I do.

316
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,320
Well then, since you understand,

317
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,370
I have two sets of data here,

318
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,280
one done by you and one by me,

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,280
I don't need to point out the differences, do I?

320
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,060
How could this happen?

321
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,160
I went to the lab

322
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
before you to extract the data,

323
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,160
which should be identical

324
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
to what you later recorded and submitted.

325
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,360
But what you submitted

326
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,960
is partially different from what I saw,

327
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,960
obviously altered by you.

328
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,680
Jiaming,

329
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,890
what exactly happened?

330
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm sorry, senior.

331
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,700
You're absolutely right.

332
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
I was blinded by profit,

333
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,080
yes, I altered the data.

334
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,760
Jiaming,

335
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,450
what's really going on?

336
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,280
Senior,

337
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,240
the person who instructed me

338
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,160
to change the data was David.

339
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,480
David?

340
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,840
Yes,

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
I remember when the research entered its second phase,

342
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,970
the process was supposed to be very tight.

343
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,040
But that's when David

344
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
suddenly approached me privately.

345
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,520
He asked me to occasionally tamper with

346
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
and alter some data,

347
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,000
causing key points to consistently show anomalies,

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,680
so this phase kept repeating

349
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,940
and never progressed.

350
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
This is our joint research.

351
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,320
David,

352
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,060
how could this happen?

353
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,960
I don't really know the deeper reasons.

354
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,480
David just told me

355
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,160
not to ask too many questions,

356
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,360
just follow his instructions carefully,

357
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,960
and he would give me a substantial payment.

358
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,120
But that amount of money, given my current salary,

359
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,780
was beyond my wildest dreams.

360
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,180
What is he trying to do?

361
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
Senior,

362
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,800
I've been tormented inside all this time.

363
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Telling you the truth today

364
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
has made me feel much better.

365
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,700
We're both Chinese students abroad,

366
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,170
but compared to you,

367
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
I'm really pathetic.

368
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,360
It's good that you told me all this.

369
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,920
So, senior,

370
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
could you please not let David know

371
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,760
that I told you about the data?

372
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,020
What are you afraid of?

373
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,360
I'm afraid I'll lose my studies and job,

374
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm afraid he'll retaliate against me.

375
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
Jiaming,

376
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,920
at a time like this,

377
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,380
you're still only thinking about yourself?

378
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,970
Julian replied to me today.

379
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,440
He said he wants to write you

380
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,080
a recommendation letter for your associate professor position.

381
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,000
He's the hottest name in biology right now,

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,080
with his endorsement,

383
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,010
this job is practically in the bag.

384
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,540
I don't actually care that much about the associate professor position.

385
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,440
You don't need to owe anyone favors for me.

386
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
Your success is my success too.

387
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,440
Hello?

388
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,280
Right now?

389
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,330
I'm having dinner with my wife.

390
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,480
Is that so? I see.

391
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,240
Alright then, I'll come over now.

392
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
See you soon.

393
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm sorry, dear,

394
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,700
I need to go out for a while.

395
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,120
Please continue eating.

396
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,200
Enmo Group.

397
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,880
That person must have donated a lot of money to the school,

398
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,480
I bet that's why David Hunt

399
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,440
went to entertain him personally.

400
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,040
Hey honey, can't sleep?

401
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,320
What's wrong?

402
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,320
What is this?

403
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,080
Since you've already seen it,

404
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,540
do I really need to answer?

405
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,850
Why did you hide your contact with Enmo Group from me?

406
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,000
You've even gotten to the point of accepting a deposit.

407
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,480
My computer password is your name,

408
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
since you could guess it so easily,

409
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,880
it shows I never intended to hide anything from you.

410
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,840
You had Jiaming alter the data,

411
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,640
causing our research to stagnate.

412
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,200
Darling.

413
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,480
And then you gave the correct,

414
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,560
effective data to Enmo Group.

415
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,800
Darling, please calm down.

416
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,120
The research grant you applied for

417
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,720
would only let you work on a shoestring budget.

418
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,050
I'm collaborating with Enmo Group

419
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,760
to help you achieve the best experimental results.

420
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
Best results?

421
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,480
You violated our contract with the Chinese side

422
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,160
and stole the fruits of my labor.

423
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,620
Enmo Group doesn't want exclusive R&D and manufacturing.

424
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
They're only asking for joint development.

425
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,880
After the drug is successfully developed,

426
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,560
you can still release it in the Asian market.

427
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,240
Yes,

428
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,840
the drug price will be several times more expensive than I expected.

429
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,840
This wasn't my intention when I started this project.

430
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
We can implement a differential pricing strategy,

431
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,560
one price for Asia, another for outside Asia.

432
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,520
We can be flexible with the approach.

433
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
We've already signed an exclusive

434
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,600
research and development contract with China.

435
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,880
If the research succeeds,

436
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,840
Enmo Group is willing to

437
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,240
pay the penalty fees for us.

438
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,920
Why is this happening?

439
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,880
I thought we shared the same goals.

440
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Darling, I don't want to discourage you,

441
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,680
but your thinking is too naive.

442
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,080
I'm a scientist, not a philanthropist.

443
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,000
My efforts deserve compensation.

444
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,360
But I am the core researcher of this project.

445
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,040
It's my laboratory that signed the contract with China.

446
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,280
So you had Jiaming falsify the data

447
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,340
to delay the experiment's progress?

448
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,200
That's right.

449
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,000
And then you gave the correct data to Enmo Group.

450
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,560
To be precise,

451
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,880
I gave the correct data to Enmo Group

452
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,340
so they could develop it with their top team.

453
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
Did you never intend

454
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,720
to cooperate with the Chinese side from the beginning?

455
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,520
How else could I get the data without cooperating?

456
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,720
I never thought you'd be so greedy.

457
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,680
No, I'm practical, darling.

458
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,640
If our partnership with Enmo Group succeeds,

459
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,170
we'll achieve financial freedom right away.

460
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We can build our own laboratory.

461
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,360
Look at me,

462
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,080
you'll be free.

463
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,680
We can do more for patients across Asia.

464
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,320
We can conquer not just hepatitis B,

465
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,120
but gradually tackle other complex diseases too.

466
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,880
Isn't that better?

467
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,800
Once the Enmo Group contract is signed

468
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,160
and your associate professor position is confirmed,

469
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,760
let's vacation in St. Petersburg.

470
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,600
Haven't you always wanted to visit

471
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,400
Nabokov's museum?

472
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,840
Darling, think about what you can gain from this.

473
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,000
You just need to do your part,

474
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,880
and we'll share the benefits.

475
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,840
Relax, relax.

476
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,240
Guo Yang.

477
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,760
I regret that we couldn't give you

478
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,520
the overseas assignment opportunity.

479
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,120
But this decision was made

480
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
after careful consideration by the company.

481
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
I did my best.

482
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,280
I understand, Manager.

483
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,600
So what are your plans now?

484
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,320
Our company cannot keep

485
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,440
employees without legal status.

486
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,560
Are you planning to return to China?

487
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
No, I don't plan to go back.

488
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,480
And I don't intend to resign either.

489
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,920
I want to find a school

490
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,520
and apply for curricular practical training.

491
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,840
I plan to work and study at the same time.

492
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,720
Then next year,

493
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,520
I'll apply for a work visa again.

494
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,720
In that case,

495
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,400
studying while working

496
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,240
would split your focus too much, wouldn't it?

497
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,440
Our company doesn't typically hire

498
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,800
part-time employees like that.

499
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,040
Don't you remember?

500
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,960
The HR office has stacks of resumes

501
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,160
that won't even fit in several boxes.

502
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Those are all from people looking for full-time jobs.

503
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,040
Yes, Manager.

504
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
But I will definitely find

505
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,780
a CPT program that won't interfere with my work.

506
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,620
Then you need to hurry.

507
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,680
I'll ask HR to delay

508
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,140
discussing your termination for a few days.

509
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Consider it a small compensation.

510
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,640
Isn't it only diploma mills

511
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,970
that don't strictly enforce attendance?

512
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,320
I need to work while studying.

513
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,960
Our company doesn't seem to hire

514
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,200
part-time employees like that.

515
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
Those are all people looking for full-time jobs.

516
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,320
Waiter, I'll have the same.

517
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,650
Coming right up!

518
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,640
This place hired a chef from Hong Kong

519
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,160
who makes hand-pulled bamboo noodles.

520
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,020
This craft is almost extinct now.

521
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,620
The only place in all of Seattle to get it.

522
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,810
Vincent, you're a real expert.

523
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,680
Alright, get to the point.

524
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,050
I heard that you know

525
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,440
some schools that offer enrollment without attendance?

526
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,680
I do know some.

527
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,420
But this enrollment thing

528
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
comes with risks.

529
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,440
You don't need to do this.

530
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,880
Your academics are fine,

531
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,400
why not just get a degree from a legitimate school?

532
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,640
To be honest, I'm completely done with studying.

533
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,500
If I study any more, I'll turn into a complete idiot.

534
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,640
What I want is to

535
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
keep my current job

536
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and try the lottery again next year.

537
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,560
I can help.

538
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,920
No classes, no attendance, valid grades,

539
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,800
20,000.

540
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,040
Is that RMB or...?

541
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,720
Dollars, of course.

542
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,280
Agent fee plus tuition, cash only,

543
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,720
no bank records.

544
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,640
How long will it take?

545
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,720
That depends on you.

546
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,010
The faster you move, the faster I move.

547
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,760
Got it.

548
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,880
As long as it's reliable.

549
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,480
That's all that matters.

550
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,560
Have you finished your homework?

551
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
If you're done, help me find

552
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
your Saint Helen's report card.

553
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,280
Didn't you print several copies

554
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,680
for emergency use?

555
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,800
No, I clearly remember putting it in this box.

556
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,640
Why can't I find it?

557
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,440
Honey, stop looking.

558
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,480
I need to talk to you. Come here for a second.

559
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,360
What are you doing? I'm in the middle of searching.

560
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,090
Come here, I need to talk to you.

561
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,080
What are you doing?

562
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,240
I'm looking for it.

563
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,720
Where is it?

564
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,220
Do you have it here?

565
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,280
Stop looking, stop looking.

566
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,840
Listen to me,

567
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,930
I can't attend this school.

568
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,880
Why not?

569
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,160
The class hours are too long,

570
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,520
work hours are too few,

571
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,560
the company will think I'm not committed to my job,

572
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
and won't sponsor my work visa next year.

573
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,490
If that happens,

574
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,840
wouldn't all our efforts be wasted?

575
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,000
If your company is like that,

576
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,960
you might as well quit.

577
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,220
Then you can focus on school and get another degree,

578
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,640
find a job through professional internship after graduation,

579
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,160
and still apply for a work visa that way, right?

580
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,640
This way you'll have a double degree,

581
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,970
which is more valuable,

582
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,200
and gives you more job options.

583
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,480
Getting another degree would take two more years.

584
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,120
Forget about two years,

585
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,600
I don't even want to study for one day now.

586
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,400
If you don't study, how will you maintain your legal status?

587
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,280
Once immigration finds out,

588
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,160
you'll be deported.

589
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,220
We don't have a choice.

590
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,160
I just want a school

591
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,520
that I can attend,

592
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,560
get a student visa,

593
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,200
and hang on until next year's work visa lottery.

594
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,040
Wait, you're confusing me,

595
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,120
if you don't attend school, how would you get a student visa?

596
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,440
I mean, I could be affiliated with a school.

597
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,640
You mean those schools where you pay

598
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
and just enroll in name only?

599
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,760
Exactly.

600
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,760
This way, I can keep my job,

601
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,160
get a student visa,

602
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,200
and stay here.

603
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
No way, I don't agree.

604
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,520
Listen,

605
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,360
these schools are risky.

606
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,240
Can they issue valid course internships?

607
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,200
Look,

608
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,720
I found a middleman

609
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,280
who helps people with this all the time.

610
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,140
There's never been any problems,

611
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,400
it just costs a bit more money.

612
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,080
How much?

613
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,000
The middleman's fee

614
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
plus one year's tuition comes to

615
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,080
twen... $20,000.

616
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,760
$20,000!

617
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
If you're not willing to spend this $20,000,

618
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,900
you'll lose much more.

619
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,800
I can't lose this job.

620
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,240
I've already made up my mind.

621
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,100
Are you going to support me or not?

622
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Do you have the school information?

623
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,440
Yes, I do.

624
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,640
Honey, I knew you're the best.

625
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,920
I knew you'd support me.

626
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,120
Let me see it quickly.

627
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,530
I'll show you right now.

628
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,770
Hurry up and show me.

629
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,800
Found it.

630
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,640
This school is really great, look.

631
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,320
Is it reliable?

632
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
Very reliable.

633
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,880
Why am I being transferred to another project?

634
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,400
The research on hepatitis B medication

635
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,530
is almost complete.

636
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,920
Are you trying to kick me off my project?

637
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,400
No, I just care about you.

638
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,080
This project is going to be very demanding from now on,

639
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,010
and I don't want you to work so hard.

640
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,900
Professor Hunter.

641
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,770
Perfect timing.

642
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,360
Dr. Xu will be joining

643
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,090
your research team for a while.

644
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,160
I've already given her your materials,

645
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,800
so you two can coordinate the transition.

646
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,840
That's great. Dr. Xu's addition

647
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,500
will certainly be a tremendous help to our team.

648
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,330
Don't work her too hard.

649
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,860
Don't worry, we'll take good care of her.

650
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,600
Senior, it's not that I don't want to help you,

651
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,840
I really can't do anything.

652
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
Although David still allows me

653
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,690
to be his assistant,

654
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,080
my every move

655
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
is under his surveillance.

656
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,120
I came to you

657
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,179
because I've figured something out.

658
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,679
David knows

659
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,920
I would eventually discover that you altered the data.

660
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,360
His contract with Enmo Group

661
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,000
wasn't completely meant to be hidden from me either.

662
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
For him,

663
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,060
he doesn't care whether I know or not,

664
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,360
only when I find out.

665
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,520
What do you mean?

666
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,219
He just wants to delay my research completion time.

667
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,880
Meanwhile, he's selling our foundational data

668
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,680
to collaborate with Enmo Group.

669
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
He wants to get ahead of me

670
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,690
and secretly complete this research.

671
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,760
This way, for the Chinese side,

672
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
he won't be in breach of contract,

673
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,040
it'll just look like Enmo Group beat us to it.

674
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,080
I've only developed this

675
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,680
hepatitis B treatment drug.

676
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,240
I see.

677
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,880
So what do we do now?

678
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,320
I must stop him.

679
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
Enmo Group has been using

680
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,560
the correct data to move forward,

681
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,160
while we've been using incorrect data

682
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,560
and failing repeatedly.

683
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,730
We're already far behind in progress.

684
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,000
They must have already passed the second phase.

685
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,800
If that's really the case,

686
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
then it's too late.

687
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,280
Once they succeed,

688
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,010
there will be nothing we can do,

689
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,340
and the patent will belong to Enmo Group.

690
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,210
I can't let them get away with this.

691
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,040
Jiaming.

692
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,920
You've been following this project from the beginning.

693
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
If I break away to complete this research on my own,

694
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,960
would you join me?

695
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Senior.

696
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,120
I'm definitely willing.

697
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,400
But,

698
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,800
how could we possibly conduct research without David?

699
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,360
Thank you for agreeing to help me.

700
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,620
As for David's matter,

701
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,440
I'll handle it.

702
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
David,

703
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,320
Professor Chen asked me to inquire about

704
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
the progress you've made recently.

705
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,290
Professor Chen,

706
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,560
didn't I tell you

707
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,760
to stop interfering with this project?

708
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,880
If Professor Chen has any questions, he should ask me directly.

709
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,280
Professor Chen only communicates with me.

710
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,280
Wei, what do you mean?

711
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
What are you trying to do?

712
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,960
David, it's not too late to change your mind.

713
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,600
Are you crazy?

714
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,400
Have you forgotten what we discussed earlier?

715
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm perfectly clear about it.

716
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,880
I just want to know if you have any conscience left.

717
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,460
You enjoy all the privileges I've given you.

718
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,600
What right do you have to criticize my decisions?

719
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,480
We're married. What's mine is yours.

720
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,800
But I don't want any of this.

721
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,680
You don't want these things?

722
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,120
Then why did you marry me?

723
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,560
Was it really just for love?

724
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,040
I can't believe you would say something like that.

725
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,640
Enough. I've had enough.

726
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,160
I want a divorce.

727
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,600
Divorce?

728
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
You dare mention divorce to me?

729
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,400
I don't want to face a

730
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,460
sanctimonious hypocrite every day.

731
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,920
You promised you wouldn't hit me again.

732
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm warning you. You better behave yourself.

733
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,520
Hello.

734
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,930
I'd like to report a domestic violence incident.

735
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,480
Yes, that's the address.

736
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,160
The police will be here soon.

737
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,080
Fine. Who do you think they'll believe?

738
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,120
You or me?

739
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,440
What are you doing?

740
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,080
Are you crazy?

741
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,840
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

742
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,890
You've completely lost it.

743
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,120
Stop, will you?

744
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,640
You think this will make the police arrest me?

745
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,120
This doesn't prove anything.

746
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Enough.

747
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,600
You know exactly what you've done.

748
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,080
I don't want to hear another word from you.

749
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,960
Save it for the judge in court.

750
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,120
To convict him,

751
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,720
we need more evidence.

752
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,360
I have it.

753
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,200
My husband has been abusing me

754
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,880
for a long time now.

755
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,960
Since the first time he hit me,

756
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,160
I couldn't accept it.

757
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,960
I didn't know what to do,

758
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,120
so I went to see a therapist.

759
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,400
My therapy records

760
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,640
can be provided to the police,

761
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,760
which should be helpful.

762
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,840
After all, you first came for counseling

763
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,640
because of domestic violence.

764
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,680
Your willingness to testify for me is a huge help.

765
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,480
I'm glad you've made this decision.

766
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,520
Before, I chose to endure it,

767
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,280
hoping to give our marriage a chance.

768
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,080
If your husband had been willing

769
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,480
to attend therapy with you,

770
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,610
perhaps it wouldn't have come to this.

771
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,000
His issues can't be solved

772
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,560
by therapy alone.

773
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,090
He must face consequences for what he's done.

774
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,640
Since then, every time he got violent,

775
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,480
I told my therapist about it.

776
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,480
She will provide my counseling records to the police,

777
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,280
along with my long-term medical records

778
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,800
that document my injuries.

779
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,280
Do you have any other evidence or witnesses?

780
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,760
Yes, there's an eyewitness.

781
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,920
Dr. Xu.

782
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,640
I need to talk to you.

783
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,280
This student had some prejudice against me,

784
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,120
so he tried to spy on my private life.

785
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,080
He witnessed my husband hitting me multiple times

786
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,520
and recorded it.

787
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,880
Better make him stay locked up for a few years.

788
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,520
This evidence is crucial.

789
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,360
I'll contact these two witnesses as soon as possible

790
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,760
to ensure they'll testify for you in court.

791
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,400
Thank you.

792
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,840
You have twenty minutes to talk

793
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,440
Let me know when you're done.

794
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
Thank you for coming.

795
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,040
What do you want to say?

796
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm sorry.

797
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
I know I've hurt you deeply,

798
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,080
and everything is irreversible now,

799
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,920
but I want you to know that I'm truly sorry.

800
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,240
Stop the act.

801
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,480
We've been husband and wife,

802
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,200
and since we're sitting face to face now,

803
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,920
let's speak some truth.

804
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,240
Wei, what are you doing?

805
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
This is our private matter.

806
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,180
Why do you need everyone to know about it?

807
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,330
I'm a professor. How can I go to prison?

808
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,480
I still have so much to do,

809
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,540
I can't be locked up in this hellhole.

810
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,560
I understand what you want, okay?

811
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,000
Please withdraw your lawsuit.

812
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640
You were committing a crime when you hit me.

813
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,200
Did you consider your image as a professor then?

814
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,400
So when a professor does something so disgraceful,

815
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,000
he should receive an even harsher punishment.

816
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,800
Stop trying to act tough.

817
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,800
I've consulted a lawyer.

818
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,620
The court will sentence me to six months at most.

819
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,160
What will you gain from this?

820
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,240
Fine, I might lose my teaching position,

821
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,260
but what about you?

822
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,970
After divorcing me, what do you have left?

823
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,560
Yes, you're right.
