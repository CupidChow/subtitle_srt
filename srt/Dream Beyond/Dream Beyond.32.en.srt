1
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,080
It's not his fault. It's about the work visa.

2
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,820
I didn't get selected.

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,920
I probably can't stay at the company anymore.

4
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,770
So you didn't get the visa lottery?

5
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,560
Isn't there any other way?

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,160
Kerry,

7
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
our friendship might not last much longer.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,760
But I'll always remember you,

9
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,800
really.

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,160
Don't say that.

11
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,759
We'll always be friends.

12
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,640
Don't be too sad.

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,600
How about I buy you a drink?

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,760
Yang, you're drunk.

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
Are you okay?

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
I'm not drunk.

17
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,020
I'm just feeling frustrated.

18
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
It's all my fault,

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,520
I shouldn't have invited you for drinks at a time like this.

20
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,000
No, Kerry,

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
you've been so good to me.

22
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,880
Kerry, you're the best girl I've ever met.

23
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,079
I really like you so much.

24
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,880
No, I can't.

25
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
No, I can't be with you.

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,240
I can't. I just can't.

27
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
Why?

28
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,320
Because I don't want to be a burden to you.

29
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,960
Are you talking about your visa?

30
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,320
Maybe I can help you figure something out.

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
It's not just the visa.

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,300
There's a bigger problem.

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,840
What do you mean?

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm sorry, Kerry.

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,280
I never told you that

36
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,560
my parents' company in China went bankrupt.

37
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,480
They owe a huge amount of money,

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,760
so I can't stay in America anymore.

39
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm a burden to anyone I'm with.

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,600
Yang, don't say that.

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,560
If it's about money,

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,120
that's even easier for me to solve.

43
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,640
Really?

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,240
I'll talk to my father tomorrow.

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,000
Kerry, why are you helping me?

46
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Because I want to be with you.

47
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,400
I regret to inform you

48
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
that the company won't be renewing your contract.

49
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
I really want to help you.

50
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,880
But there's nothing I can do now.

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
When have things ever gone smoothly for me?

52
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
Whenever I try to accomplish something,

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,370
I always face more obstacles than others.

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,280
There's nothing we can do about it.

55
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
We have no choice.

56
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,520
Where have you been?

57
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,280
Honey, why are you still up?

58
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,920
I've been calling you all night,

59
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,180
why didn't you answer?

60
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,360
I went out drinking,

61
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
had too much.

62
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,640
I didn't hear your calls.

63
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
When I saw them, it was already too late.

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
I was afraid of disturbing your sleep,

65
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
otherwise I would have called you back.

66
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Look at you, reeking of alcohol.

67
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Who were you drinking with?

68
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
By myself.

69
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
It's finally confirmed,

70
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,240
my work visa was rejected.

71
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
Who told you that?

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,840
It's been so many days,

73
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,840
and I haven't received a single email.

74
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,880
That's it, it's over.

75
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,460
Completely rejected.

76
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,520
And the company won't renew my contract either.

77
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm sorry, honey.

78
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,200
I didn't know.

79
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,440
It's not your fault.

80
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm just feeling frustrated.

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
I thought having a drink would help,

82
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,840
but it only made me feel worse.

83
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,760
Drinking to drown your sorrows never helps.

84
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Let me make you some hangover soup.

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
No need, really.

86
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,520
So what do you want to do now?

87
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,600
What can I do? Find a solution.

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,880
What other options do you have?

89
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,320
If nothing else works, like you suggested,

90
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,760
I'll go back to school

91
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,760
and apply for a course internship.

92
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Whatever happens,

93
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,120
I have to stay in America.

94
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,440
I think there's someone who would be perfect for this.

95
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,640
Who?

96
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
Thank you, uncle.

97
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Wang Jingying.

98
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
Jessica.

99
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,450
She really is a good fit.

100
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
Why didn't I think of that?

101
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
Betty is too mischievous.

102
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,530
I'm worried Chen Yingxi won't get along with her.

103
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,560
They're both kids around the same age.

104
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,240
They'll get along fine once they spend some time together.

105
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,170
But what if Jessica doesn't agree?

106
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,480
Betty's mind isn't on studying at all.

107
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
Chen Yingxi has good grades

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
and can help motivate her.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,960
She should be able to spark Betty's interest in studying.

110
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,600
The more I think about it, the more it seems like a win-win solution.

111
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Jessica wouldn't disagree, would she?

112
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,040
The host is a poor student and the guest is a top student.

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,600
This kind of dynamic

114
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,860
is already sparking with conflict just thinking about it.

115
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
Gu Nian, aren't you worrying a bit too much?

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
I've been burned by Betty before.

117
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
With Chen Yingxi's personality,

118
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
how can I not worry?

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,890
If they really don't get along,

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
then she'll have to go through

121
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
being kicked out a second time.

122
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,360
No, no. This option has too many risks.

123
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
But making this decision for her,

124
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,840
isn't that a bit arbitrary?

125
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,920
After all, Chen Yingxi is the one concerned.

126
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
You should at least let her know

127
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,760
and ask what she thinks.

128
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
Fine, I'll go ask for her opinion.

129
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,760
No, I think you should

130
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,360
consult Wang Jingying first,

131
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,460
since she's the parent after all.

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,560
That's true.

133
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,440
Let's go now then.

134
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
Wait.

135
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,400
Can you take me with you?

136
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,560
Sure.

137
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,640
Okay.

138
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
I'll go change my clothes.

139
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,160
This kid is so nice,

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,880
how could she get kicked out?

141
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,400
Aren't white host families usually friendly?

142
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
She just finished her junior year of high school

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
and has been preparing for her academic assessment tests

144
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
and taking advanced placement courses since arriving.

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,240
She's extremely busy all the time.

146
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,640
The host family probably felt that

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,160
she came here just to get into a good college,

148
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
using them as tools,

149
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,100
without any genuine cultural exchange.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,480
This family is quite amusing.

151
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
Shouldn't students be focused on

152
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,560
getting into a good university?

153
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,160
Trying to understand a country through one person

154
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
is already too idealistic,

155
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,720
let alone when it's just a child.

156
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
This kid not only has excellent grades,

157
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,340
but has won quite a few awards too.

158
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,370
First place in English speech.

159
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,080
Even got second place in Math Olympiad.

160
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,490
That's impressive.

161
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,850
So how is she doing academically here?

162
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
Top-notch.

163
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,300
That's fantastic,

164
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,320
so what are we waiting for?

165
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Let her move in.

166
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,640
Don't worry.

167
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
My accepting this child

168
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,120
is actually to give Betty

169
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,980
a good role model for her studies.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,700
She's the perfect candidate.

171
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,400
So it's settled then.

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,400
Mom, I'm heading out!

173
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,960
You just got a C and you still want to go out?

174
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,690
I already made plans with them.

175
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
Betty, why can't you learn from Zhuopeng

176
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
and Gunian?

177
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
Do you have any idea how much time they spend

178
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,920
studying every day?

179
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,000
Betty! Betty!

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
Jessica.

181
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,280
Should we ask Betty's opinion about this?

182
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,160
Yes, after all, she's also a member of the family.

183
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
This is for her own good,

184
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,090
what objections could she possibly have?

185
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Besides,

186
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
I think having two kids

187
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
of the same age keeping each other company is nice.

188
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Don't worry,

189
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,180
nothing will go wrong with me around.

190
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,240
So now we just need Yingxi's opinion.

191
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,210
I'll ask her about it later.

192
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,760
Jessica, thank you.

193
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,580
No need to be so formal,

194
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,960
so it's settled then.

195
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,250
We won't bother you any longer.

196
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
Let me see you out.

197
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,760
You all go ahead,

198
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,970
I'll stay here a bit longer.

199
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,960
Let's go.

200
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,360
We really owe you a lot this time.

201
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,200
Chen Yingxi is a good kid,

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
he'll definitely help if he can.

203
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,480
I hope she can really stay at Jessica's place,

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
if that works out,

205
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,600
it'll be easier to look after her.

206
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,640
If Chen Yingxi can also help motivate Betty with her studies,

207
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,920
that would be perfect.

208
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,250
Let's hope for the best.

209
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,640
Mr. Zhuo, are you free tonight?

210
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,200
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

211
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,880
Alright.

212
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay.

213
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,440
What's wrong with Lin Yao?

214
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,900
Go to my place now and close all the curtains.

215
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,880
Okay, I'll be right there.

216
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm sorry, Gu Nian.

217
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm sorry, Gu Nian.

218
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,800
It's fine, just go.

219
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,530
We can have dinner another day.

220
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,240
Be careful.

221
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,240
Do you have something to say

222
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,640
or not? If not, stop following me.

223
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,320
I do. I really do.

224
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
Then hurry up and say it,

225
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,330
and leave when you're done.

226
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
Jingying,

227
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,480
I...

228
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,680
I know I was wrong, definitely wrong,

229
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
and I'll definitely make serious changes.

230
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
But you have to let me understand why.

231
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,760
How did I hurt you?

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,080
What did I do wrong?

233
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,400
At least I need to know how to make it up to you.

234
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,200
You've really disappointed me.

235
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
No, please be more specific.

236
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,640
Say something.

237
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
I don't contact you for a month,

238
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,570
and you don't reach out either, right?

239
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I thought you were upset

240
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
and didn't want to talk to me.

241
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,130
That day I went to talk to Betty,

242
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
but then you just left on your own.

243
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,480
Why should I even bother with you?

244
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,800
Wait, weren't you the one who told me to leave?

245
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,720
Just because I told you to leave, you actually left?

246
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't you even think about it?

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,720
I almost got pregnant,

248
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
and Betty found out about our relationship.

249
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,520
Shouldn't you have stayed to face it with me?

250
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,760
Yes, yes, I was negligent,

251
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,960
I'm sorry, Jingying.

252
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,280
I know where I went wrong now.

253
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,280
That's not the point.

254
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,320
Then what is the point?

255
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,720
Did I tell you to sit down?

256
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,720
Go ahead.

257
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,220
That day I went to your store to buy a pregnancy test,

258
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
and you actually charged me for it.

259
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,920
So that's what this is about.

260
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,440
How could I have thought of that?

261
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,120
You don't think that's a problem?

262
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,520
Yes, yes, it is a problem,

263
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,480
a big problem, very serious.

264
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,160
What I mean is from now on,

265
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,400
I will definitely take responsibility

266
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
No matter how you try to push me away,

267
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
I will always stand behind you.

268
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,180
I will never be a deserter.

269
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,400
Always standing behind me?

270
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,280
What are you, a ghost?

271
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,160
Even as a ghost, I'd still love you.

272
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,680
Get out!

273
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,220
What are you doing?

274
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Let go!

275
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,320
Zhuo Zhanwei!

276
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,840
How dare you!

277
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
Lin Yao, what's going on?

278
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Why did you ask me to close all the curtains?

279
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Lin Yao?

280
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,530
Lao Jiang is in trouble.

281
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,000
I pretended to go to the maternity hospital for a checkup,

282
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,240
to get away temporarily,

283
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,300
then I escaped through the back door.

284
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
To be safe,

285
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,119
I flew to Portland first,

286
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,720
then rented a car and drove all the way here.

287
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,000
This house was recently purchased,

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
they haven't found it yet.

289
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,020
But they know I've lived in this city for many years,

290
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,319
they'll find this place sooner or later.

291
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,920
But they have legal loan agreements,

292
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,800
why not go to the police instead of tracking you?

293
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Once they involve the police, whether Lao Jiang shows up or not,

294
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,780
it'll enter a lengthy legal process.

295
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,320
Bank accounts will be frozen,

296
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,980
houses will be auctioned off.

297
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,400
I suspect the money in the accounts

298
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
has already been transferred by Lao Jiang,

299
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,400
so all that's left are the houses

300
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,920
and those art pieces of questionable authenticity.

301
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,640
But I just found out

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
that before our marriage,

303
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,560
Lao Jiang had already transferred the house to his daughter.

304
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,420
The creditors are also gambling,

305
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,970
betting that Lao Jiang won't abandon his son.

306
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,800
But they lost.

307
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,600
I lost too.

308
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Don't think too much about it now,

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,400
these are all just speculations until the truth comes out.

310
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,880
I wanted to buy this house for you back then,

311
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,090
also to prepare for a day like this.

312
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,040
If you had accepted it then,

313
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
this could have been my sanctuary now.

314
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,960
But now this house is still part of my marital property.

315
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,760
I can only hide here temporarily.

316
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,690
Don't worry about all that now,

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,960
the most important thing right now

318
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,760
is to safely deliver your baby.

319
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,560
You should rest,

320
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
I'll help you organize your things.

321
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
Yang.

322
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,800
Kerry, why haven't you left yet?

323
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,240
I was waiting for you.

324
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,160
I got tickets for a movie tonight,

325
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,760
and then dinner afterward.

326
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,480
You got tickets?

327
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,340
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

328
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
Do you have other plans?

329
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,080
No.

330
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,120
Were you just standing here the whole time?

331
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,880
All those colleagues saw you on their way out.

332
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
So what if they did?

333
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,040
Nothing, just asking.

334
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,360
Let's go then.

335
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,640
Marriage.

336
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,900
Isn't it too early to talk about this now?

337
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,560
I don't think so.

338
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,920
As long as the feeling is right,

339
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,640
we can get married anytime.

340
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,560
I just think marriage is a big deal.

341
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,880
I mainly don't want to make a bad impression on your father.

342
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,400
I think

343
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,960
I should sort out my own issues first,

344
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,660
before we talk about this.

345
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
I understand.

346
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,770
I'm not pressuring you.

347
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
Where's Luo Yan?

348
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600
She just left five minutes ago.

349
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,460
Call her and tell her to come back.

350
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,360
What's wrong, Professor Wu?

351
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,640
Don't you understand what I said?

352
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,120
She said she wasn't feeling well,

353
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,520
might have caught a cold.

354
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,080
Call her.

355
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,880
What's the matter, Professor?

356
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,280
Xiang Nongchao, you recommended her,

357
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,410
so you make the call.

358
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,160
Do you have a cold?

359
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
No, I don't.

360
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,570
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

361
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,440
Not at all.

362
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,560
If nothing's wrong, why are you leaving?

363
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,200
Am I not allowed to go home?

364
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
What time is it now?

365
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,640
7:23.

366
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,840
It's only just past 7,

367
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,840
everyone else is still working,

368
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,600
how can you have the nerve to leave early?

369
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
Professor,

370
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,520
I arrived at the lab at 7 AM today,

371
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,680
went to the campus cafeteria for lunch,

372
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
walked around campus a bit after eating,

373
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,960
which all took less than an hour,

374
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
and then I got home at 7 PM tonight.

375
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
That means my working hours today

376
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,000
were a full 11 hours,

377
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,400
and you've assigned me a project

378
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,560
that should be handled by three people.

379
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,080
Get to the point.

380
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm your student,

381
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,640
not a machine,

382
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,360
and even machines need rest.

383
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,480
Let me tell you, when I was a student,

384
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,920
I could work on several tasks simultaneously

385
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,560
and achieve perfect results on each one.

386
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
You have no idea how

387
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
top-tier students actually work.

388
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,840
Such a simple project,

389
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,200
and you spend 11 hours on it in one day

390
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
and claim it needs three people to complete.

391
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,080
What does that tell me?

392
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,340
It simply shows your skills and abilities are inadequate.

393
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Be honest with me,

394
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,260
can this project actually produce any results?

395
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,320
The deadline hasn't arrived yet.

396
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm afraid you won't finish it even by then.

397
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Who said scientific research always guarantees results?

398
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't forget,

399
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,450
you signed a guarantee letter.

400
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,760
Then take that letter and sue me in court.

401
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I'd really like to hear how the court

402
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,000
will rule on this case.

403
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Luo Yan, are you trying to get fired?

404
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,480
No, no, Professor.

405
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,680
Professor, please calm down.

406
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,120
Yanzi is just young and speaks her mind.

407
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Actually, our Luo Yan

408
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
is best at giving people surprises.

409
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,640
No need to wait until the deadline,

410
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
she's already surprised me now.

411
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,160
Luo Yan.

412
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,320
Look at where you came from,

413
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,160
that third-rate school

414
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,020
that nobody outside the industry has even heard of.

415
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,600
I gave you the opportunity

416
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
to join Saint Helen,

417
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,640
a world-class institution.

418
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,080
Provided you with excellent lab facilities

419
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,680
and the chance to work with so many brilliant minds.

420
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,920
I rescued you from hell.

421
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,000
And what's the result?

422
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,240
Your skills, abilities, and manners are all third-rate,

423
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,880
a perfect match for that dump you came from.

424
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,020
If you can't take it anymore, just leave.

425
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,560
What do you mean?

426
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,000
You've only been here for such a short time

427
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,440
and you're already in such conflict with Mr. Wu.

428
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,840
You're not someone who easily backs down,

429
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
so how can you keep working here?

430
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,320
But you saw it today,

431
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,960
he was really unfair.

432
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,900
Mr. Wu is just an extremely harsh person.

433
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,080
And you're so stubborn.

434
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
Rather than continuing this conflict,

435
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,240
where nobody gets any peace,

436
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,690
you might as well make other plans now.

437
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,040
But I have nowhere else to go.

438
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,080
This is all my fault.

439
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,640
But like this,

440
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,120
with tensions running so high all the time,

441
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,680
it's not sustainable.

442
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,200
Tomorrow I'll go talk to Mr. Wu,

443
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll make things clear with him

444
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,570
and get justice for you.

445
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,720
Senior, don't be impulsive.

446
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,840
I'm the one who brought you here,

447
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,100
I can't just watch you being mistreated.

448
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,880
You're telling me to leave,

449
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,440
but where can I possibly go?

450
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,560
I can't go back

451
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,880
to my previous advisor.

452
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,400
Take some time,

453
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,560
our field is still in demand,

454
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,800
that's better than suffering here.

455
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,480
Actually, Mr. Wu is quite difficult to please.

456
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,880
Being his student

457
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,000
really does require

458
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
more time and effort than others.

459
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,480
Since I've decided to come here,

460
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,960
I need to be determined to endure hardship,

461
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,680
I can't fight over pride.

462
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,360
I should prioritize my studies.

463
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,380
Is that what you really think?

464
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,040
Didn't you tell me to be diplomatic,

465
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
to be patient?

466
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
Don't force yourself, really.

467
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,480
If I can't handle this hardship,

468
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,040
I shouldn't have come abroad.

469
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,040
There's no such thing as a white crow.

470
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
You'll encounter these situations anywhere.

471
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
If others can graduate, so can I.

472
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,720
It's good that you can think this way.

473
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,280
I'm feeling much better now,

474
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,680
sorry for worrying you,

475
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,040
it won't happen again.

476
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,600
That's great.

477
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's go, I'll walk you home.

478
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm telling you

479
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,520
when Lin Yao bought her house

480
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,720
she paid in full cash

481
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,960
without hesitation.

482
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
How did things end up like this?

483
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,000
Life is unpredictable.

484
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,960
By the way, Zhuo Peng,

485
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,840
my birthday is coming up in a few days,

486
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,440
why don't you bring Gu Nian over to celebrate with us?

487
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,760
Sure, I'll let her know.

488
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Great.

489
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,520
It's your birthday?

490
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
Well then,

491
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,760
Zhuo Peng, why don't you invite Lin Yao too?

492
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,620
She's pregnant and all alone now.

493
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,040
With no one to rely on.

494
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,320
Okay.

495
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm done here, gotta go.

496
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,480
Alright.

497
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,240
Bye, Jessica.

498
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,720
Bye,

499
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,960
bye-bye.

500
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,520
Are you out of your mind?

501
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,800
What did I do?

502
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,080
I really didn't know it was your birthday.

503
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,760
I'm not talking about the birthday,

504
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm talking about Gu Nian and Lin Yao.

505
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
Don't you know what their relationship is?

506
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,610
What relationship?

507
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,960
The current girlfriend and the ex,

508
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,820
is it appropriate for them to have dinner together?

509
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,810
Since when is Gu Nian the current girlfriend?

510
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,360
Are you really clueless or just pretending?

511
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,200
That's good news!

512
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,080
You don't need to worry.

513
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,120
Lin Yao and Zhuo Peng have already

514
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,360
moved on from their relationship.

515
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
When they're together, they're just like family,

516
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,520
it's no big deal.

517
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,400
You really are carefree.

518
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,960
You can't even understand something this simple.

519
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,160
How are we celebrating your birthday?

520
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,080
I'm not telling you.

521
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,440
Where are you?

522
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,920
I can't tell you.

523
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,480
Zheng Xiangdong and his people are going crazy looking for you.

524
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,120
Please tell Zheng Xiangdong

525
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
that I'm not Jiang Zhenghao.

526
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,520
I'm not disappearing to avoid my debts.

527
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,040
I just want some peace and quiet

528
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,280
to take care of my pregnancy.

529
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,040
You still need to keep your lines of communication open.

530
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,120
When I can't find the person involved at a critical moment,

531
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,840
it feels really terrible.

532
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,920
I have a solution

533
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,320
that can help you resolve this debt crisis.

534
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,960
What solution?

535
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,280
There's an overseas education company called Lizhong,

536
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,200
don't you have shares in it?

537
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,240
Yes,

538
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,640
I started it right after college graduation

539
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,880
with my ex-boyfriend.

540
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,010
Does it still exist?

541
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,880
Of course it does, and it's doing very well.

542
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,360
I've heard about it.

543
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,420
What does this have to do with my case?

544
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,440
It didn't before,

545
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,960
but now that might change.

546
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,840
Mr. Zheng Xiangdong, Jiang Zhenghao's biggest creditor,

547
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,040
suggests that you sell Lizhong Education,

548
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,760
and your shares can be used to pay off the debt.

549
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Sell Lizhong Education?

550
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,650
Who would want to buy it?

551
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,240
Mr. Zheng Xiangdong personally found a large company

552
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
that's willing to acquire Lizhong Education.

553
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,600
How much are they offering?

554
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
The exact price isn't clear.

555
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,160
This is just what Zheng Xiangdong's lawyer

556
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,720
has conveyed as his proposal.

557
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,200
However, according to him,

558
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
if the acquisition goes through,

559
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,200
all your debt to Zheng Xiangdong can be cleared.

560
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,680
Is an education agency worth that much?

561
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,000
Besides, I only own 45% of the shares,

562
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,080
how could that be worth so much?

563
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,200
Data shows

564
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,720
that Lizhong Education's new effective user registrations

565
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,760
have increased a hundredfold during this period,

566
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
now exceeding one million.

567
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,800
And its industry reputation is excellent.

568
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,720
If this trend continues,

569
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,000
its market value will be quite substantial.

570
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
One million? How is that possible?

571
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,160
Also,

572
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,920
Zheng Xiangdong and his team want to meet with you in person

573
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,560
if you're willing.

574
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,760
There's no point in talking to just me.

575
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,440
My ex-boyfriend is both the legal representative and the major shareholder.

576
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
That's why they've requested

577
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
that when you meet,

578
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
both you and your ex-boyfriend, Mr. Zhuo Peng,

579
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,520
attend together.

580
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,720
Whatever the case,

581
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,520
I suggest you give it a try.

582
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,320
Gu Nian.

583
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,120
Gu Nian.

584
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,240
Gu Nian.

585
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,890
Professor Zhuo, what is it?

586
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,280
Are you free this afternoon?

587
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,640
I'm sorry?

588
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,240
Are you free this afternoon?

589
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,760
Is there something you need?

590
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,220
I'd like to take you out for a nice meal today.

591
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,560
A nice meal?

592
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,560
Let's go.

593
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,740
Wait, where are you going?

594
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,240
Weren't you going to take me out for a nice meal?

595
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
We're going to Jessica's place.

596
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,320
It's Jessica's birthday today,

597
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,360
and she invited you to her family gathering.

598
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
It's her birthday?

599
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

600
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,560
I haven't prepared any gift.

601
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,080
You didn't let me finish.

602
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,360
Jessica said

603
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,280
you guys don't need to spend money on gifts.

604
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,160
You guys?

605
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,450
Oh right, Lin Yao will be there too.

606
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,560
Let's go,

607
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,440
I'm starving.

608
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
I was waiting for you.

609
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,920
Coming!

610
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,720
Gu Nian, you're here! Come in!

611
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,040
Please come in.

612
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Gu Nian looks different today.

613
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,930
She looks prettier.

614
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,860
I've always looked like this.

615
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,640
That scarf looks special.

616
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,200
Here, let me take it.

617
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,840
Here you go. Thanks, Dad.

618
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,400
Lin Yao, you're too kind.

619
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,080
You even prepared a gift for Betty.

620
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,360
It's nothing.

621
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,800
As long as Betty likes it.

622
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,920
It's beautiful! Thank you, Lin Yao.

623
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,780
Happy birthday, Jessica.

624
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,720
Gu Nian is here.

625
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,560
These flowers are for you.

626
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,000
Thank you.

627
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Happy birthday, Jessica.

628
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,640
Thank you.

629
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,200
What beautiful flowers.

630
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,760
Zhuo Peng, please put the cake in the fridge.

631
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay.

632
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,680
Gu Nian, where's my gift?

633
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Betty is so rude.

634
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,720
I'm really sorry,

635
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,280
I just found out it's your birthday

636
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,880
and didn't have time to prepare anything.

637
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,560
Gu Nian,

638
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,440
I told everyone not to bring gifts.

639
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,240
I just wanted everyone to have a good time together,

640
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
I'm just happy you're here.

641
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,620
Look how thoughtful some people are.

642
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,800
Behave yourself.

643
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
I'll go arrange the flowers.

644
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,240
Gu Nian, we meet again.

645
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,840
Hello, Lin Yao.

646
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,040
Zhuo Peng, Gu Nian,

647
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,570
come over here, please.

648
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,840
Uncle Zhuo, let me help you.

649
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,800
Close the door.

650
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,720
Are you guys out of your minds?

651
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,440
Why are you always causing me trouble?

652
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,120
What's wrong?

653
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,160
You're letting Chen Yingxi stay at my place.

654
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,040
Looks like Jessica told you

655
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
about Betty.

656
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,920
We were planning to discuss it with you.

657
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
Planning to?

658
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,040
You clearly didn't tell me anything at all.

659
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,800
I've already helped you bring Chen Yingxi to America,

660
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,320
and now you're letting her stay at my house,

661
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,560
are you guys insane?

662
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,480
Chen Yingxi has excellent grades.

663
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,960
You can ask her about any problems you can't solve.

664
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,880
If I can't figure it out, I just won't do it.

665
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,720
I don't care about that stuff anyway.

666
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,280
Betty is about your age.

667
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,480
You'll have company once she moves in.

668
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,840
I don't need company, Angel.

669
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,360
I need freedom, Sangel.

670
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,220
I need freedom.

671
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,560
Who knows if this is

672
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,200
you and my mom teaming up to monitor me?

673
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,730
You're overthinking this.

674
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,280
It's because Chen Yingxi

675
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,760
was kicked out by her previous host family.

676
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,440
I don't care.

677
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,000
Just stop talking about it, okay?

678
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,719
This is my house, my territory.

679
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,380
I don't agree with her coming.

680
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,760
We have no choice.

681
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,719
We can't go against Betty.

682
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,480
Just humor her.

683
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,320
Humor her.

684
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,920
I hope everyone is satisfied with

685
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Chef Zhuo's cooking today.

686
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,199
Thanks to Jessica's birthday.

687
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,600
It's truly a feast. Absolutely delicious.

688
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,770
I've really missed Uncle Zhuo's cooking.

689
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,639
To be honest,

690
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,520
today's birthday girl has given me

691
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,600
this wonderful opportunity

692
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,159
to showcase my culinary skills

693
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,820
and prepare something delicious for everyone.

694
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,120
Good job. Keep it up.

695
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,720
Absolutely.

696
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,800
It really is delicious.

697
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,730
Much better than my mom's cooking.

698
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,700
In comparison, it feels like she's just been feeding me whatever.

699
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Just eat your food.

700
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,160
You're good at nothing except eating everything in sight.

701
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm still growing, aren't I?

702
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,080
I actually think that Betty

703
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,520
has quite an artistic sensibility.

704
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,360
She often talks to me about films and music,

705
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,090
and she really knows her stuff.

706
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm actually quite old-fashioned,

707
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,960
and I don't understand many new things,

708
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
but when Betty explains them to me,

709
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,280
I find it all very interesting.

710
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,210
I like the sound of that.

711
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Me too.

712
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,040
We can discuss it together in the future.

713
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,640
Yeah,

714
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,440
we could go see movies together.

715
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,610
Once Upon a Time in America.

716
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,720
Betty, I'm really into art too.

717
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,400
We should hang out more,

718
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,160
like film festivals, art exhibitions, concerts.

719
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,320
I can easily get tickets.

720
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,800
Really?

721
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
Then we should exchange contact info.

722
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,800
Seems I chose the wrong gift for you today.

723
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,400
Next time I'll definitely get you professional headphones.

724
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,240
I love over-ear headphones.

725
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,520
The bass is amazing.

726
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,960
Lin Yao, don't spoil her.

727
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,920
It's good that Betty has hobbies.

728
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,360
We should encourage her.

729
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,720
Maybe Betty will become a musician someday,

730
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
or even a star.

731
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,520
I certainly hope so.

732
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,160
Lin Yao, eat more.

733
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,120
Uncle, I've eaten too much today.

734
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,280
You've always been so thin.

735
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,920
Even when you were pregnant, you didn't gain weight.

736
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,720
You have to maintain your weight even during pregnancy.

737
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Otherwise, after giving birth,

738
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,000
what if you can't get back in shape?

739
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,920
That would be awful.

740
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,000
Not at all.

741
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,280
Actually, being a bit plump is quite cute.

742
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,240
No way, no way.

743
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,480
No matter what,

744
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,680
you still need to maintain your figure.

745
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,120
Get in the car,

746
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,520
I'll drive you both home.

747
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,920
No need,

748
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
you can take Gu Nian home.

749
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,720
My place is quite close,

750
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,000
and I ate too much, so I'd like to walk it off.

751
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,760
You should drive Lin Yao home,

752
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,480
she's pregnant,

753
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
and this is close to the school.

754
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,960
I'll just take the bus back,

755
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,920
bye!

756
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,400
Let's go.

757
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,810
Have you fallen for Gu Nian?

758
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,640
Is it that obvious?

759
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,960
I saw you two getting along well last time,

760
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
but I see there's still no progress.

761
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,960
If you really like her, you should make a move.

762
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Things are fine now,

763
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,320
quite natural between us.

764
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,920
Alright,

765
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,320
seems the timing isn't right yet.

766
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,680
Take it slow.

767
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Before dinner,

768
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,120
I heard you two talking quite loudly in the room.

769
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,680
Sounded like you were arguing.

770
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,000
What happened?

771
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,320
It was about an exchange student.

772
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,720
That kid has excellent grades and performance all around,

773
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,520
and a really good personality too.

774
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,400
We all thought

775
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,530
she would be a good roommate for Betty.

776
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,160
But Betty absolutely refused.

777
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,040
Is she a client of Lizhong Study Abroad?

778
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,880
Strictly speaking, she's a friend.

779
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,080
Gu Nian has been helping her voluntarily in various ways.

780
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,720
I heard Lizhong Study Abroad is doing quite well now.

781
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,320
So you've heard about it too.

782
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,200
I was originally planning to follow your advice

783
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
and shut down the company.

784
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,320
But Gu Nian came up with some new ideas.

785
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,800
I've seen your website.

786
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,120
Having successful overseas students

787
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,360
mentor those who want to study abroad.

788
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,220
Great concept.

789
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,720
I also think Gu Nian's concept is excellent,

790
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,250
so I decided to give it a try.

791
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,880
Cutting out the middlemen,

792
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,120
reducing study abroad costs,

793
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,680
creating direct connections for information and experience sharing.

794
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,800
So what about profits?

795
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,600
For each case, we only keep

796
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,200
5% for the company's daily operations,

797
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,660
and the rest goes to the mentors themselves.

798
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,520
So you don't want to make money?

799
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,000
Like building the company to a certain scale

800
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,720
and then selling it or going public?

801
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
I don't have such big ambitions.

802
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,800
We just want to do what we can

803
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,360
to help kids who genuinely want to study abroad.

804
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,600
Zhuo Peng.

805
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,760
You go first.

806
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,240
If you're willing,

807
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,600
I can help you find a suitable job.

808
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,680
Zhuo Peng, thank you.

809
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,720
But I can't rely on a job to clear my debts.

810
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,050
Hello, Professor Zhuo.

811
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
Gu Nian, um,

812
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,360
I've dropped off Lin Yao.

813
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,280
You did?

814
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,000
That's good.

815
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
Come down,

816
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,890
I'm outside your building.

817
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,800
You're outside my dorm?

818
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,280
Professor Zhuo.

819
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,480
You didn't eat enough earlier, did you?

820
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,040
I did. I ate plenty.

821
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,290
Come have some more.

822
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,200
Here.

823
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,800
Wait,

824
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,080
how much do you think I can eat?

825
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,720
You bought so much food.

826
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,960
Studying is hard work,

827
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,320
you should eat more.

828
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,960
But I didn't know what you wanted,

829
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,640
so I got a bit of everything.

830
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,480
Here, have some tea.

831
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,040
I'm not picky about food

832
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,120
I eat everything.

833
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,200
That's good.

834
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,360
No, no

835
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,680
I'll get fat if I eat too much.

836
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,970
What's wrong with gaining weight?

837
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,840
Being a bit plump is nice too.

838
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,930
Go ahead and eat.

839
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,940
I'm eating.

840
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,260
Eat while it's hot.

841
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,420
Professor Zhuo

842
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,640
the weather is getting warmer today,

843
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,320
you don't need to keep wearing that scarf.

844
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,400
It is a bit hot.

845
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,000
Go ahead and eat.

846
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,360
