1
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Pete

2
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,360
run!

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,880
Okay.

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,560
Have a nice day,

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,320
goodbye.

6
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Actually, there are some things I don't understand

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,730
and wanted to talk to you about.

8
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
After dating my mom and getting married,

9
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
going through so much together,

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
how could you fall for someone else?

11
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
I guess we've

12
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,840
never really

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,079
talked about this issue before.

14
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,800
So can we talk about it now?

15
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,800
It's not what you think.

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,079
Back then,

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,480
you were just a child.

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
Well, I'm grown up now,

19
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,480
can you tell me the truth?

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
These things

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,420
are difficult to explain in just a few words.

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,730
If you hadn't fallen in love with someone else back then,

23
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
would everything be different now?

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Zhuopeng,

25
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,680
do you hate me?

26
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,880
Does it matter?

27
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,050
You're still my father,

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,480
blood ties can't be changed.

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,220
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,640
Had a fight with Lin Yao?

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,410
You've been drinking all night, haven't you?

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Isn't it the same with Lin Yao?

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,320
No matter what she's done,

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,079
she's still my family.

35
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,560
How is that the same?

36
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,640
Family bonds and romantic relationships are completely different.

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,960
What's really going on between you two?

38
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,040
We broke up.

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800
Did she suggest it?

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,120
If there's any misunderstanding between you two,

41
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,520
you'd better clear it up,

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,850
don't end up like me,

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,780
regretting it for a lifetime.

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
You're all people who make decisions,

45
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,980
so don't talk about regrets anymore.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
But your life is really a mess.

47
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,200
If this is

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,460
the fate of someone who makes decisions,

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,460
I don't want her to end up like you,

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,880
I want her at least

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
to be happy.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
Fine,

53
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,920
since you don't want to talk about what happened back then either,

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I'll be going now.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
I'll find a cleaner for you tomorrow

56
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,880
to tidy up your place.

57
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,840
No need.

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
I have my own hands and feet,

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,120
I can take care of myself.

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
Zhuo Peng.

61
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,440
Zhuo Peng.

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm leaving.

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,360
Before I go,

64
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,890
I still wanted to see you one last time.

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,120
I was wrong about what happened before.

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
What I said to you at the wedding yesterday,

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,930
that was wrong of me too.

68
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
I came to apologize to you.

69
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
Yesterday I said

70
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,040
I blamed you for not giving me the life I wanted.

71
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,800
Actually,

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,400
I was just making excuses

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,260
for how my feelings have changed.

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,600
But I haven't changed my mind.

75
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
I think

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,050
it's better for both of us to separate.

77
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,840
Even if you had proposed to me that day,

78
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
the result would have been the same.

79
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Zhuopeng.

80
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,540
Thank you for being the one to say we should break up.

81
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,440
Thank you for letting me go.

82
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,840
Lin Yao, you finally said it out loud,

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
your decision.

84
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,000
I've changed.

85
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
I long for a different kind of life.

86
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,720
A room with a view.

87
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,000
A closet that's never empty.

88
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,460
Being able to travel whenever I want.

89
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,080
Always doing only what I love.

90
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
I've had a taste of that life,

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,840
and now I want it completely.

92
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Fine.

93
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,840
At least this time

94
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,360
you're telling the truth.

95
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
I once thought

96
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
there might still be a chance for us.

97
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,960
Actually, you love me

98
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,760
much more than I love you.

99
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,480
What do you mean?

100
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,360
This is 30,000 yuan.

101
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
You spent your own money to refund the students at Lizhong Study Abroad Agency

102
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
and covered all the costs yourself.

103
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
I won't take it.

104
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't worry,

105
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
this is my own money

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
that I earned these past few years as a personal shopper and tour guide

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,220
and from running my business.

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,159
Take the money back.

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,340
This money represents what I invested in our previous relationship.

110
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,679
Now that relationship is over.

111
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
This is what I owe you,

112
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,480
and I should pay you back.

113
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
You can't give me what I want.

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
What you want to return,

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,880
I don't need at all.

116
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Lin Yao.

117
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,920
I hope in the future.

118
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
Were you just a moment too late?

119
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Goodbye is just two words

120
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
that should have been said long ago.

121
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,520
Zhuo Peng!

122
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,560
Zhuo Peng!

123
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,320
Calm down!

124
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
How dare you hit someone!

125
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,080
Lin Yao, call the police.

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm going to sue him for assault.

127
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,680
Zheng Hao,

128
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,720
I didn't hit you because you're taking Lin Yao away,

129
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,880
but because you

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,040
have no basic manners.

131
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,280
You're seriously messed up,

132
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,640
what kind of person is this?

133
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,770
Get in the car first.

134
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,120
Don't hate me,

135
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,540
take care of yourself.

136
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,360
Professor Zhuo,

137
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,080
I've completed all the paperwork,

138
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,840
and it's time for me to return home as promised to my parents.

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm going back to China.

140
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,200
Thank you for taking care of me during this time.

141
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,440
I wish you good health and all the best in the future.

142
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,280
Gu Nian.

143
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,300
I am Gu Nian, the perfect student.

144
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
This nickname my classmates gave me

145
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
was once my pride,

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,200
but now it fills me with mixed emotions.

147
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
My name reflects who I am.

148
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,360
'Nian' means to read.

149
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,440
And in Chinese, 'nian shu'

150
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
means to study or learn.

151
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,800
So I've always thought

152
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,280
that my parents gave me this name

153
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,160
hoping I would study hard.

154
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,960
Until one day,

155
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,280
my father told me

156
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,960
that he used an ancient poem

157
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,920
as a love letter to win my mother's heart.

158
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,520
That's when I realized that in Chinese, 'nian'

159
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,560
also means to miss or think of someone fondly.

160
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:01,960
Best Wisteria Literary Award

161
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,840
All this time, I had mistaken my parents' love memento

162
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,280
for their expectations about my studies.

163
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,560
However,

164
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
my father's daily poem ritual

165
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,800
helped me win

166
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,530
the National Ancient Poetry Competition award.

167
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
I suppose both their interpretation

168
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
and mine of the character 'nian'

169
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,330
have been effective in their own ways.

170
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,680
I've always wanted to do something

171
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,200
for students in impoverished areas.

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,620
But I don't want to rely on my parents' help to accomplish this.

173
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,840
So when I found out that the champion

174
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,280
of the National High School English Debate Competition

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,400
would receive generous prizes,

176
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,120
I worked extremely hard to win the championship.

177
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
This way,

178
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
I could donate all the champion's rewards:

179
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,400
multi-year subscriptions to English learning journals,

180
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,920
English reference books,

181
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,520
audio-visual materials and various study supplies

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,840
to students in underprivileged areas,

183
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,800
helping more students eager to learn English.

184
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
And I also improved my speaking skills in the process,

185
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,480
which I guess was an extra bonus.

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,160
So when I came to America, I was very confident,

187
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,200
believing that with my outstanding student abilities

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,760
I could quickly secure my college admission

189
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,360
and return home triumphant.

190
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,520
But in an unfamiliar environment,

191
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,760
my pride

192
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,280
was quickly crushed by you and reality.

193
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,160
I never imagined that working while preparing application materials

194
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,600
would be so difficult.

195
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
My reckless behavior

196
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,920
almost cost someone their livelihood.

197
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,680
My English speaking skills that I was so proud of

198
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,760
completely failed me during the interview.

199
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,040
For the first time, I realized

200
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,500
that maybe you were right,

201
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,690
being a top student isn't everything.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,960
So,

203
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
I must face my shortcomings

204
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,720
and accept them, then change them.

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,930
Professor Zhuo,

206
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
here's my personal statement.

207
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,690
Do you think I can pass your assessment

208
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,400
and become a qualified applicant?

209
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,440
I've read your statement,

210
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,560
it's excellent.

211
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,420
I appreciate the ceremonial touch of handwriting.

212
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Professor Zhuo, I have good news for you,

213
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,880
my precious belongings have been found!

214
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,560
What?

215
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,340
I'm telling you, they found my suitcase.

216
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,000
Apart from my laptop being gone,

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,040
not a single book is missing.

218
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,280
Isn't that amazing?

219
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,720
Yes, amazing, truly amazing.

220
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,440
So where are you now?

221
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
Have you seen my personal statement?

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,720
Yes.

223
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Really? How is it?

224
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,840
It's decent. Passing grade.

225
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,680
What? I passed!

226
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
That's great!

227
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
Professor Zhuo, I don't know how to thank you.

228
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,360
Those candies on the table

229
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,840
are my gift to you.

230
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,200
They're quite special,

231
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm telling you, if you eat them,

232
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,650
they'll make you happy.

233
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,200
Hurry up! We need to go, we're running late.

234
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,280
Okay, coming!

235
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
Professor Zhuo, I've got to go now.

236
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,360
Bye-bye!

237
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
Now let's look at the grammar exercise.

238
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,640
A university professor and his elderly mother

239
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
have become famous on Chinese social media.

240
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,320
Professor Hu brings his 80-year-old

241
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,200
mother who has Alzheimer's to his classes.

242
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,240
At first, the freshmen thought she was a

243
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,280
Dear Gu Nian,

244
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,680
congratulations!

245
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,520
I am pleased to inform you

246
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,800
that you have been accepted to St. Helen University.

247
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,680
Oh my God!

248
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,440
The Thinker

249
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,720
The Thinker

250
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,760
Honey

251
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,440
Yes, I'll be home soon.

252
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,119
I'm almost done,

253
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,079
just double-checking everything.

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
Okay, see you later.

255
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,119
Goodbye.

256
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,760
Caught you!

257
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,000
Hide and seek is over now.

258
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,240
So close, yet so far.

259
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
Are you talking to me?

260
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
Just one more day.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,050
I was just one day away from completing it.

262
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,560
What do you mean?

263
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,600
Last night I was in the middle of my

264
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,280
ten-night meditation practice at the library.

265
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Last night was the final night,

266
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,320
but I failed because of you.

267
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,200
Meditation?

268
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
It's a way to communicate with the universe,

269
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,240
a journey of mind, body, and spirit

270
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,880
toward the promised land.

271
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
I have no idea what you're talking about.

272
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,760
But we're being punished now

273
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,240
because of your mistake.

274
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,640
You panic easily when things happen.

275
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,400
That's not good.

276
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,520
Have you considered joining the Meditation Club?

277
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,560
There's actually a Meditation Club?

278
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Of course,

279
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,890
I'm the president of the Meditation Club.

280
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
Are you Japanese?

281
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,560
No, I'm Chinese.

282
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,360
Chinese? That works too.

283
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,080
To enter a Zen state,

284
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,680
you need a quiet environment,

285
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,560
a place where you can meditate without disturbance.

286
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,480
I can't believe how serious you are about this.

287
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,320
Both of you, pay attention.

288
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
You need to put these books back on the shelves

289
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
strictly according to their codes.

290
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Being a volunteer for a month is too long.

291
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,800
Is there any way to reduce my punishment?

292
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,160
If you can catch the next rule-breaker,

293
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,040
I'll let you go.

294
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,200
There are always a few every year.

295
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,440
About joining the club.

296
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Where are the social science bookshelves?

297
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,780
The application was successful.

298
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,040
Professor Zhuo,

299
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
long time no see.

300
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,700
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to school?

301
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,680
I've been too busy with my studies,

302
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,160
I just forgot about it.

303
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,080
Are you studying at Saint Helen too?

304
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,520
I borrowed Xiang Nongchao's student card to look up some materials.

305
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
Do you know where the humanities and social sciences shelves are?

306
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,400
Looking for a book?

307
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,840
Yes, I'm looking for 'Social Psychology,'

308
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,880
the one by David Myers.

309
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,120
That one? It's probably gone.

310
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,880
What? I thought there was still one left.

311
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,200
I was just over there and didn't see it.

312
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,800
I need that book for my assignment.

313
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,920
Alright, I'll go back and look again.

314
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,640
Okay, see you later,

315
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,680
bye.

316
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,840
Oh my god!

317
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,020
Good thing I reacted quickly.

318
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Good.

319
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,920
Good luck.

320
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,920
I want to check out this book.

321
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
You're on disciplinary duty,

322
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,960
you can't leave, much less check out books.

323
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
Okay, you can check out the book.

324
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,760
Thank you very much.

325
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,360
All done.

326
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
Thanks, bye.

327
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,320
Good luck.

328
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Are you using your own student card?

329
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,980
Please show me your student card.

330
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,240
Gu Nian.

331
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,520
Gu Nian.

332
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,720
They let you out so quickly.

333
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,120
Why did you do this?

334
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm sorry, Professor Zhuo. I was just desperate.

335
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,200
What's going on?

336
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
That Indian girl you just saw, Jiabao,

337
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
she's my classmate

338
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,000
and my biggest rival.

339
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
She got A's on both assignments since the semester started,

340
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,890
while I only got A-minuses.

341
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,440
This book is crucial for the next exam.

342
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Whoever gets this book will get an A.

343
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,560
And the library only has this one copy left,

344
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,080
I can't lose again.

345
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,080
Why don't you just check out the book

346
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,120
properly then?

347
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,520
That's exactly the problem - I can't.

348
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,600
The night before last, I snuck into the library

349
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,520
and got caught by that owl-eyed old lady.

350
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,240
She punished me with a month of volunteer work at the library

351
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,640
unless I could find another rule-breaker.

352
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
You really would do anything

353
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,800
just to get an A.

354
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
I'm your student,

355
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,280
surely you don't want your student to be worse than others?

356
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,840
Don't drag me into this.

357
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,800
Indian students are naturally good at studying,

358
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,840
you're just facing a mountain here.

359
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,600
Says who?

360
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,040
Even if she's Mount Everest.

361
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,520
I'll climb over there too.

362
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,440
My dad.

363
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,920
Bedtime video call.

364
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,680
Don't say anything.

365
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
Nian Nian,

366
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,280
the weather's getting cooler there,

367
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,600
make sure you wear your sweater,

368
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,800
don't catch a cold.

369
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
I know, Dad.

370
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,730
I have something to do, I can't-

371
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
Isn't that Teacher Zhuo?

372
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Teacher Zhuo,

373
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,080
hello.

374
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Hello, Mr. Gu.

375
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,930
Nian Nian's getting quite clever.

376
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
By the way, the gift Nian Nian brought for you,

377
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,920
do you like it?

378
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,200
Gift?

379
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,080
I've been too busy with school and forgot.

380
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,000
Dad, I need to go now,

381
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,040
I gave Teacher Zhuo his gift,

382
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,840
bye-bye.

383
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,080
So?

384
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
This way.

385
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,920
You like putting up posters too?

386
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
Wouldn't have guessed that.

387
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,080
No, there was a hole in the wall that looked ugly,

388
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,280
so I just found something to cover it up.

389
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Who's this?

390
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,520
This is the national Math Olympiad champion,

391
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
who gets scholarships every year,

392
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,880
my idol.

393
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,480
Here you go, Teacher Zhuo.

394
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,080
Thank you.

395
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,320
It's quite heavy.

396
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,920
What is it?

397
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,250
I don't know either. Let's open it and see.

398
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,410
Tea leaves. My dad's favorite.

399
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,330
I think this is what your dad really loves.

400
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,560
This is my acceptance letter from Saint Helen.

401
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,600
My dad printed 100 copies

402
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,360
and sent them to all my relatives and friends.

403
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,680
I mean, sharing it in Beijing is one thing,

404
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,200
but sending it all the way here?

405
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,080
It's so embarrassing.

406
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,760
That's just parental pride.

407
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,700
I'll accept your father's kind gesture,

408
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
please thank him for me.

409
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,720
Professor Zhuo,

410
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
I remember you also got a full scholarship, right?

411
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes, why?

412
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,120
Let's take a photo together.

413
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,400
Everyone with full scholarships is my idol.

414
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,960
Ready,

415
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,560
one, two, three!

416
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,400
Perfect!

417
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,680
I'll be going now.

418
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,640
Bye-bye.

419
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,370
Don't see me out.

420
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,040
Hello everyone, I'm Ivy, new to the club.

421
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,400
I've brought some desserts for everyone.

422
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,800
What's all this?

423
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
Happy hour.

424
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
I guess I had to wait until I'm almost graduating

425
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,920
to enjoy perks like this.

426
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,600
These are all Cantonese pastries,

427
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,360
specially made by a Cantonese chef I hired.

428
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
Help yourselves.

429
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
Nice to meet you, Ivy,

430
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,260
I'm Patrick, president of the Image Memorial Club.

431
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,720
Patrick, which one would you like?

432
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,080
Are you a freshman?

433
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes, I want to study film and media management,

434
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,440
I enjoy planning events and exhibitions.

435
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,000
Welcome.

436
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,560
This one's for you, Patrick.

437
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,680
This is delicious,

438
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,440
thank you.

439
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Gu Nian, help me out.

440
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,840
Gu Nian, what are you doing? Come help me.

441
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,600
Come on.

442
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
It's upside down.

443
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,320
I was wondering why there's so much left again.

444
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,400
They're all yours.

445
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,480
Mine?

446
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,360
I haven't even finished yesterday's leftovers.

447
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,560
Just eat them slowly.

448
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,760
You're only in four clubs,

449
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,640
if you join any more,

450
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,500
you'll be supplying all my meals.

451
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Can I give you some advice though?

452
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,040
Stop buying donuts all the time,

453
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,240
get some vegetables and fruits instead.

454
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
Are you kidding me?

455
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,680
I didn't know what everyone liked before,

456
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,360
so I just bought extra.

457
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,120
Is it good?

458
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,480
Want some?

459
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm not eating, I'm on a diet,

460
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,210
I feel like I've gained weight lately.

461
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,560
With so many club activities,

462
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,680
and such a tight schedule,

463
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,210
when do you have time to study and do homework?

464
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,880
Oh no.

465
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,900
I still have an essay to write.

466
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,920
Gu Nian,

467
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,280
do you have any spare essays

468
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,410
you could let me use?

469
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,600
No.

470
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,480
How could you not have any?

471
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
I see you writing every day,

472
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,840
and you revise each essay multiple times,

473
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,800
countless drafts.

474
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Just give me your first draft.

475
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
How could that work?

476
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,800
How can I be so careless about studying?

477
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,680
Just getting by with studies is fine.

478
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Let me tell you,

479
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm a woman destined to climb the club ladder.

480
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,920
The club is my top priority in life.

481
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,640
How could clubs possibly be more important than studying?

482
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,080
This is where you don't get it.

483
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,520
In American universities,

484
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,400
club activities are a crucial part of campus culture.

485
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
Many famous Americans

486
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,720
got their start in college clubs.

487
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,800
I, Huang Xin'er, am going to be the first

488
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,130
freshman to become a club vice president.

489
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,920
That should be easy, right?

490
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,760
How could it be easy?

491
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
There are so many students at school,

492
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,200
and I'm an international student,

493
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,320
all foreign students from freshman to senior year

494
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,000
are my competitors.

495
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,180
That's why I joined so many clubs,

496
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,240
it's just like how you study,

497
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,900
know yourself and your enemy.

498
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,210
You've really done your homework on these clubs.

499
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,400
I just remembered something.

500
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,600
The Chinese Students Association is having a Halloween event soon,

501
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,920
you must attend,

502
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,400
you've been a member for almost a month now,

503
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,060
surely you'll join us, right?

504
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,040
I don't have time, I'm not going,

505
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,000
besides, every event is just about eating and drinking,

506
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
nothing exciting.

507
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,440
It's fine if you don't come,

508
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,080
but you should at least contribute something,

509
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,740
you can't always be like this.

510
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,880
Do what?

511
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
Let me tell you,

512
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,960
I've been

513
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,520
looking for a restaurant for our Halloween party,

514
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,480
I searched high and low,

515
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,680
and finally found

516
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
that Chinese restaurant where you used to work.

517
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,440
I thought,

518
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,640
you must be quite familiar with the owner,

519
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,160
so maybe you could call and make a reservation for me.

520
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
No, no,

521
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,240
my relationship with the boss is just okay,

522
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,040
he probably doesn't even remember me.

523
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,640
You...

524
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,920
Gu Nian,

525
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
sooner or later you'll become

526
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
the laughingstock of the Chinese Students Association.

527
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,120
I've been teaching at St. Helen's for over 20 years.

528
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,840
But when people ask me how I teach literature,

529
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,200
I always tell them I don't know.

530
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
I look at the students sitting here.

531
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,720
Some of you are native English speakers,

532
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,520
some of you are not.

533
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,960
Everyone has a different level of language proficiency.

534
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,880
I need to understand your levels

535
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,000
in order to teach you properly.

536
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,240
So, class is dismissed for today,

537
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,320
thank you.

538
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,200
What? Class is over?

539
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,680
Alright, quiet down.

540
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,960
There is homework for this class.

541
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,800
The theme is 'A Girl's Story.'

542
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,120
It can be an essay, a short story,

543
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,800
or even a poem.

544
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,200
Send it to my email by noon on Friday,

545
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,080
don't be late,

546
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,200
I'll count it toward your grade.

547
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,360
Thank you.

548
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,440
Ghost story.

549
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,960
Thanks.

550
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,800
How do I write a ghost story?

551
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,560
Nian Nian.

552
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
You scared me to death!

553
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
What are you afraid of in broad daylight?

554
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,680
The teacher just assigned us homework

555
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,720
to write a ghost story,

556
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
and I was just brainstorming.

557
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,160
Stop thinking about that

558
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,800
and come with me to pick up some snacks for the club.

559
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Don't you have class?

560
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,520
Come on, let's go. Hurry.

561
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,240
No.

562
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Sweetie,

563
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,600
are you getting used to the dorm?

564
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
If not, you can move out.

565
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,320
Didn't I tell you

566
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm doing fine there?

567
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,720
Living with an international student

568
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,080
who can't help you with anything.

569
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,040
I was hoping you'd at least get

570
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,700
a local student as a roommate.

571
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,920
Gu Nian doesn't cause any trouble,

572
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,240
and she only cares about studying,

573
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
she won't cause me any problems,

574
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,160
so don't worry.

575
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,520
I have to go now,

576
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,400
I'm busy,

577
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,760
bye-bye.

578
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Who studies in a pastry shop?

579
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,440
And you said you'd help me carry the snacks.

580
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Time is more precious than gold.

581
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,410
Here, take these. There's so many.

582
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,540
Are you really not coming to dinner tonight?

583
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,560
If I bring my homework there,

584
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,290
that would be really annoying.

585
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,240
We should have a reunion dinner together in this foreign country,

586
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,160
besides,

587
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,840
we're all lucky students who got into

588
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Saint Helen's after they raised the admission standards,

589
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,960
we should stick together

590
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,490
and vent a little, you know?

591
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,480
What's there to complain about?

592
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,520
No matter how high the standards, I could still get in.

593
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,239
Let me tell you,

594
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,199
I take the TOEFL every two months,

595
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,440
and my score gets higher each time,

596
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,080
I was almost getting a perfect score.

597
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,239
Don't let others hear you say that,

598
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,480
they'll hate you for it.

599
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,320
Really?

600
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,960
Nian Nian,

601
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,360
spending Halloween alone tonight

602
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,960
seems kind of sad.

603
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,199
Sad?

604
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,920
If I don't get straight A's on my assignments,

605
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,320
that would be truly sad.

606
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,159
Alright, this is far enough.

607
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,889
Here, let me,

608
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,120
you have so many things,

609
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll help you carry them up. Let's go.

610
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,639
No need.

611
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,480
I want others to see I can't carry all this.

612
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,280
Why?

613
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,679
You should hurry to your study session,

614
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,480
I'm going now.

615
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,480
Oh, Nian Nian,

616
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,320
don't forget to call the Chinese restaurant

617
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,600
to make a reservation.

618
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,489
The key is to get a discount.

619
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:51,880
Listen,

620
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,960
the owner definitely won't remember me,

621
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,600
and our boss is really stingy.

622
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,240
Rather than wasting my breath arguing with him,

623
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,280
I might as well solve a few more problems.

624
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,720
No way, you have to help me with this favor.

625
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,080
Fine, I'll try.

626
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,840
But why do we need a discount so badly?

627
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,360
Well, if there's no discount,

628
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,220
then what's the point of having connections to book this restaurant?

629
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,360
Alright, I'll book it.

630
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,720
You can do it!

631
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,480
I'm going now.

632
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,000
Bye.

633
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,720
Zhuo Peng

634
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,000
and Xiang.

635
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,360
Not bad.

636
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,620
What's with that look?

637
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,330
Why aren't you going in?

638
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,280
I can't get in.

639
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,440
Why not?

640
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,220
No appointment, no entry.

641
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,330
That can't be right.

642
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,800
How am I supposed to write this ghost story?

643
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
What's wrong, honey?

644
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,960
Gu Nian, you finally answered your phone.

645
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,920
Didn't I ask you

646
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,360
to make a reservation at that Chinese restaurant?

647
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,720
We're all here now,

648
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,780
but the manager says we don't have a reservation at all.

649
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,960
Gu Nian, you didn't call, did you?

650
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,100
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about it.

651
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,400
Xin'er, give the phone to the manager.

652
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,240
I told him

653
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,120
it's too late now,

654
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,380
they're fully booked.

655
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,040
Can I count on you at all?

656
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,400
No, as soon as you told me,

657
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,680
I just turned around and completely forgot about it.

658
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Forget it, I'll deal with you later.

659
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,840
Gu Nian forgot,

660
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,280
it's okay.

661
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,880
Everyone, please don't worry,

662
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,740
the restaurant issue will definitely be resolved.

663
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,880
Mom.

664
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
Cheers.

665
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,400
Everyone, let's first thank Huang Xin'er

666
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,960
for solving our restaurant issue tonight.

667
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,120
Secondly,

668
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,000
this year the Chinese Students Association has five new members joining us,

669
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,480
let's welcome them.

670
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,000
Welcome.

671
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Thank you all.

672
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,360
Thank you, senior.

673
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,650
Why didn't Gu Nian come?

674
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,440
Xin'er, does Gu Nian have something going on tonight?

675
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm not sure either,

676
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
I came straight from the club meeting.

677
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,440
Gu Nian said

678
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,840
that our Chinese Students Association

679
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,480
only knows how to eat and drink all day,

680
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,920
nothing serious, just a waste of time,

681
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,450
so she doesn't want to come.

682
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,600
This Gu Nian is really something,

683
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,520
it's one thing not to show up,

684
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,680
but she didn't even confirm the order,

685
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,940
we almost had nothing to eat. Seriously.

686
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,250
This was my mistake, my oversight,

687
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
I'm sorry, everyone.

688
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,280
Confirming an order is just making a phone call,

689
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,200
is that so hard?

690
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,000
It just depends on whether she cares or not.

691
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,560
She never comes to any activities,

692
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,160
is she the only one with a busy course load?

693
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,120
Xin'er, you participate in so many clubs,

694
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,440
aren't you much busier than her?

695
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,500
Yet you never let us down on anything.

696
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,600
She just looks down on us.

697
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,080
Don't talk about Gu Nian like that,

698
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
she's not that kind of person at all.

699
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,040
Stop defending her,

700
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,480
she thinks she's so great,

701
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,520
almost got a perfect TOEFL score,

702
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,000
like she's from a different world than us,

703
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,920
she definitely won't come out to eat with us anymore.

704
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,800
The Chinese Students Association is meant to be a group that helps

705
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,730
Chinese international students.

706
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,840
We don't require everyone to participate,

707
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,920
so we don't need to be overly

708
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,250
concerned about whether she comes or not.

709
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,400
Besides, this year's situation is somewhat special,

710
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,840
Saint Helen suddenly raised the TOEFL score requirement,

711
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,160
and ended up accepting only five new students,

712
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,720
each one is precious.

713
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,000
So the fact that we can sit here tonight

714
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,200
is already a rare connection.

715
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,600
Let's not hold any grudges.

716
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,840
The students you've trained

717
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,000
have no human decency at all.

718
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,560
They use people and throw them away.

719
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,800
You're of no use to them anymore.

720
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,730
Can't we eat without all this talk?

721
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,880
Our assignment is to write a ghost story,

722
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,680
but I'm too scared to even read Strange Tales,

723
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,800
and they want me to write a ghost story.

724
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,330
How am I supposed to do this?

725
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,650
What are you smiling at?

726
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,010
I'm not smiling.

727
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,400
Everyone, everyone.

728
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,800
This semester,

729
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,840
Sister Xu Wei will be joining Saint Helen,

730
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,920
she's our first graduate to successfully stay and teach at the school.

731
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,960
Let's all raise a toast to Sister Xu Wei.

732
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,020
Congratulations.

733
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,280
Congratulations.

734
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Thank you.

735
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,480
I'd like to take this opportunity

736
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,760
to say a few words.

737
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,810
I'm about to start my new job

738
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
and I can't keep managing the Chinese Students Association forever,

739
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,360
it's time to hand it over.

740
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,160
Who could do better than Sister Xu Wei,

741
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,920
right?

742
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,840
That's right,

743
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
yes, exactly.

744
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,360
I also started as a newcomer

745
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,800
and gradually grew into this role.

746
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,560
As for candidates,

747
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,320
they don't need to be perfect from the beginning,

748
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,920
but they must have a sense of responsibility.

749
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,560
And willing to serve everyone,

750
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,320
we don't rule out selecting from newcomers,

751
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,600
since the position should go to the most capable.

752
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,720
Then Gu Nian can be ruled out immediately.

753
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,640
I agree.

754
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,000
It works.

755
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,400
This trick really works!

756
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,960
What are you doing?

757
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,420
I'm writing a ghost story.

758
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,140
Writing ghost stories for Halloween

759
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,360
is quite fitting.

760
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,040
No, it's mainly because I had no inspiration,

761
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,480
so I called my teacher,

762
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,800
and she told me

763
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,520
that I needed to find a way

764
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,320
to get into character,

765
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,720
something about Stanislavski's method acting,

766
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,040
so I'm imagining this place as a desolate wilderness

767
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,880
and myself as the female ghost.

768
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,280
What kind of teacher is that? They're messing with you!

769
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,080
I'm telling you, it really works,

770
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,960
my creativity is flowing now.

771
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Sure, you're here being all creative,

772
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,480
but do you have any idea tonight

773
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,160
how much flak I took for you?

774
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,160
I'm sorry,

775
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,040
after you told me,

776
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,120
I just turned away.

777
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,600
It's fine, it's fine,

778
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,000
I've already handled it.

779
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,080
Oh, by the way,

780
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,840
I might become the successor for the Chinese Students Association.

781
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,520
Really? Then your goal is about to be realized.

782
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,760
Although it might be a bit premature to say this,

783
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,690
but I think I'm quite competitive.

784
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,680
Congratulations, your goal will be achieved before mine.

785
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,920
This is just one of my small goals.

786
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,210
Can I ask you something?

787
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,080
Can we go to sleep?

788
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
What are you up to now?

789
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,640
I'm writing ghost stories. Turn off the lights.

790
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,440
You're still playing ghost?

791
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,640
Don't worry, I won't disturb you at all.

792
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,200
Alright then, I'll go wash up first.

793
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,600
It seems after teaching at St. Helen's for so long

794
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,000
I've somewhat forgotten my British accent.

795
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,080
The homework I assigned you last time

796
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,760
was to write about a young girl's story,

797
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,840
but I received a ghost story instead.
