1
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,240
This is Chen Lili, the stylist I hired.

2
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Hello.

3
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,000
Please, have a seat over here.

4
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,500
Do you two know each other?

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Yes.

6
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,280
Of course not.

7
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,400
How could I possibly know him?

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,600
I'd never have the chance to meet Mr. Jiang,

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,260
such a high-class gentleman.

10
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,490
Lin Yao, we broke up last month.

11
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,160
Didn't we agree not to see each other again?

12
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,720
Why are you here causing trouble?

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
Lin Yao sent me here.

14
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
Get out! Disappear now!

15
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
You're more attractive when you're angry

16
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,840
than when you're gentle.

17
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,760
You crazy woman!

18
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
Lin Yao!

19
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,800
Lin Yao!

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Let me explain, Lin Yao!

21
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
Stop following me!

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Lin Yao!

23
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,560
Lin Yao! Lin Yao! Lin Yao!

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
Get out of here!

25
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,240
Lin Yao!

26
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,840
Lin Yao, let me explain!

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
Lin Yao!

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Lin Yao, please listen to me!

29
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,810
It's been over between us for a long time, Lin Yao!

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,500
What's wrong with Lin Yao?

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,660
None of your business.

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Lin Yao! Lin Yao, open the door!

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Jiang Zhenghao, get the hell away from me!

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,240
I don't want to see you right now!

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,440
Zhuo Peng, come in.

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,640
Lin Yao.

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,160
Come in.

38
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,490
Have you lost your mind?

39
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,280
Jiang Zhenghao!

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
How dare you!

41
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Lin Yao!

42
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,940
Come back to China with me!

43
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,360
Dad,

44
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,920
what do you mean?

45
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,040
You don't still want to stay with that bastard, do you?

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,160
Yes!

47
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,730
Are you serious?

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,050
Are you serious?

49
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,880
Dad.

50
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,400
I just want to receive your blessing,

51
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
why is that so difficult?

52
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Isn't marriage supposed to be

53
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
the happiest moment in one's life?

54
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,960
Lin Yao.

55
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,520
Dad, you've been through this

56
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,960
and you're a man too.

57
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,040
I know exactly how men think.

58
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,200
You young girls can't even imagine.

59
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,320
Let me tell you this,

60
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,720
from the moment I first saw that Jiang fellow,

61
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,760
all my life experience told me

62
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,240
he's not the ideal husband for you.

63
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
The gap between you two is too wide.

64
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,960
You're still concerned about the age difference.

65
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,440
Since the day I met him,

66
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
I've accepted that he's 20 years older than me

67
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,240
and has been married before. I don't care about these things.

68
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,450
You say he's not your idea of an ideal husband,

69
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,760
so what is your idea of an ideal husband?

70
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,280
Can you even describe it?

71
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,480
Well, I certainly can.

72
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
I want my husband to provide me with

73
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,880
a stable foundation, superior conditions,

74
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,920
high social status, freedom of choice,

75
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,280
and Jiang Zhenghao can give me all of this.

76
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,280
And all of this

77
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,159
comes from his 20 years

78
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,520
of life experience more than mine.

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Well, you're telling the truth.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,960
But I'm not just talking about the age gap.

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Do you truly know this person?

82
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Are those external conditions enough?

83
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,760
Living with a man

84
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,160
you can't figure out,

85
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
will you feel secure?

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Dad.

87
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
Who can claim they truly see

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,020
and understand someone completely?

89
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Everyone has their issues.

90
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,159
But at least he has genuinely helped me.

91
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,080
If I marry him,

92
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,400
I can work to narrow

93
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,760
the gap between us,

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,920
I can enter the social circle I want,

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,040
that's the life I want, Dad.

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Is that really the life you want?

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Is what you want such a materialistic,

98
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,280
practical marriage?

99
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
Of course not, Dad.

100
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,240
Do you think I'm just using

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
my marriage as a stepping stone?

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,880
What is that?

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,560
We truly love each other.

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,480
He does everything I ask.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
When I was sick,

106
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,410
he canceled his business meetings

107
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,320
and took care of me for 24 hours straight without sleep.

108
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,600
Whatever I wanted to eat, no matter how far or difficult,

109
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,920
he would personally go get it for me.

110
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
There are so many little things

111
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,200
I can't list them all for you.

112
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,400
But he tolerates my willfulness

113
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
and accepts all my flaws.

114
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,159
All these ways he's good to me,

115
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,840
you don't see any of it.

116
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,320
What does all this matter, my daughter?

117
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
The things you're talking about

118
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,360
are too flimsy to sustain a long marriage.

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,960
He's pursuing you.

120
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,320
All his sweetness,

121
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
it's not trustworthy

122
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,280
and it won't last.

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
Do you understand?

124
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm not looking for forever.

125
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
We're in love now,

126
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,440
we're harmonious and need each other,

127
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
and we're willing to build a life together.

128
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,120
That's enough.

129
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,530
Who can guarantee anything will last?

130
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,440
If it ever reaches a point

131
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
where I can't accept it anymore,

132
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,800
I'll calmly end it.

133
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
End it calmly.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,530
You need to understand,

135
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
if you have another child,

136
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,050
you'll worry about them for the rest of your life.

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
To be honest,

138
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm not a perfect wife either,

139
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,520
and he has to put up with many of my flaws.

140
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,360
Dad, I know

141
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
you're worried about me.

142
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,080
You're afraid he'll mistreat me or deceive me.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
All I can tell you is,

144
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,920
even if that happens,

145
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,680
it would be my own choice.

146
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,160
Alright.

147
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,160
You've grown up.

148
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,040
Since you've thought everything through,

149
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,000
it's your life and your marriage.

150
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,560
Then

151
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,040
I wish you the best of luck.

152
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,600
Daughter,

153
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,960
if this path is the right one,

154
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,040
Dad certainly hopes to see you happy for life.

155
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,560
If it turns out wrong,

156
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
come home.

157
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,080
Dad will always be here waiting for you.

158
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,240
Dad.

159
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,400
Ms. Lin.

160
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
Is everything okay in there?

161
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
Be good to Lin Yao.

163
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,210
If you don't treat her well,

164
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,520
I'll take her away anytime.

165
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,400
Okay.

166
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,280
If you don't behave, you'll get another beating.

167
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,520
I won't, I won't.

168
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,250
Does it hurt?

169
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,920
It's fine, doesn't hurt.

170
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
You've rented the venue?

171
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,120
Yes, look, here's the contract.

172
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,120
We don't need to worry about this anymore,

173
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
I took care of it.

174
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,960
Well done, Huang Xin'er.

175
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,040
Thank you.

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,240
Patrick, come take a look,

177
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,970
we've finished the paintings.

178
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,480
Nathan, good news,

179
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,920
you don't have to worry about the charity sale anymore.

180
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
What? Why?

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,840
We have a venue now.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,660
What? How did you manage that?

183
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,960
I don't know,

184
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,840
it's Huang Xin'er's secret.

185
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,560
What about these paintings?

186
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
The paintings can be displayed on the day of the event.

187
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,480
I've prepared some snacks. I'll go get them.

188
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
Is he sick?

189
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
There's clearly an event today.

190
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Are you looking for the Meditation Club?

191
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes. Do you know where they are?

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,320
They went to the activity room.

193
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,400
Activity room?

194
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,040
Yes, the activity room in Gates Building.

195
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,680
They have more members now.

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,840
Okay, thank you.

197
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,600
What a shame. I'll have to clean up myself from now on.

198
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,960
From your abdomen, okay?

199
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,480
Relax. Clear your mind.

200
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,040
Breathe.

201
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Peter.

202
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
Keep breathing.

203
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,120
Straighten your back. Use your abdomen and muscles.

204
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,480
Why haven't you been coming to the library?

205
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,280
You haven't been coming to the club either, have you?

206
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I looked for you all,

207
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,680
but you weren't there anymore.

208
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah, we have more people now,

209
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,280
so we needed a new space.

210
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,680
Can we talk for a minute?

211
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,640
We don't need to go outside,

212
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,720
we can talk here.

213
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,280
What's wrong?

214
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,520
Why do you keep standing me up

215
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,450
and not responding to my messages?

216
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,480
Didn't we have a date at the library?

217
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,000
Date? Are we dating?

218
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
Look, if you don't want to come meditate.

219
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,560
You don't have to come

220
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,440
since you don't seem interested in meditation anyway.

221
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
But I like it

222
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,120
because I get to see you at the meditation club.

223
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
But that's not the point of the meditation club.

224
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,320
You don't understand the concept of meditation.

225
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,520
If you truly respected meditation,

226
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,840
you wouldn't fall asleep during sessions.

227
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,960
I do understand and respect it.

228
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,000
But why are you acting like this?

229
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,080
I thought you enjoyed studying with me.

230
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,210
I never said I liked studying with you.

231
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,560
Actually, I hate the library,

232
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,480
and I don't like

233
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,880
hearing you talk about homework every lunch.

234
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,760
Study dates are really boring,

235
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,480
you know?

236
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,680
We don't have to go to the library.

237
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
You're just a boring person.

238
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,240
I've had enough.

239
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,720
Zhuo Peng.

240
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,599
What's with that suitcase?

241
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm heading to the airport soon.

242
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,359
So suddenly?

243
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,200
Three months ago, I applied for

244
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,319
Professor Baker's psychology graduate program.

245
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,359
I passed the preliminary exam,

246
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,089
so I need to go back and prepare for the interview.

247
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
I see.

248
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,480
That's great.

249
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,040
Well,

250
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,720
let me get you some

251
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,380
Chinese herbal cold medicine

252
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,460
that I brought specially for you.

253
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,650
Thank you, teacher.

254
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Going to England?

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,120
Bath.

256
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,040
Finally fulfilling your dream.

257
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Had I known, I should have thrown you a farewell party yesterday.

258
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,560
You know

259
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,440
I don't want to make our farewell too ceremonial.

260
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,170
That's true,

261
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
leaving with style is more like you.

262
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,120
You'll be in Bath and I'll be in New York,

263
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,720
it'll be even harder for us to meet up in the future.

264
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
It's just a plane ticket, such a simple thing.

265
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,780
Just give me a call and I'll come back.

266
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,720
You won't put down roots in Bath

267
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,380
and never come back, will you?

268
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,760
Who knows what the future holds.

269
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
What about you? What are your plans?

270
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,160
I'll travel around with Zhenghao,

271
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,220
learn a few things,

272
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,140
maybe open an art gallery.

273
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,970
What about Lizhong Education?

274
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,940
I'll close it down.

275
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I probably won't have the energy to manage it anymore.

276
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,690
You're leaving too,

277
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,780
so I might as well shut it down.

278
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,970
Alright, I'll take care of it then.

279
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,020
I should go now.

280
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Let me walk you out.

281
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,760
Okay.

282
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,760
You're back.

283
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,760
What are you

284
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,200
doing here?

285
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,520
Come here! I've been waiting for you.

286
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,120
What's up?

287
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Big gossip.

288
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,440
I haven't even told you who it's about,

289
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
and you're already not interested?

290
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,000
Who is it?

291
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,760
Guess.

292
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,040
Fine, I'll tell you.

293
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,040
Your star student

294
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,200
Gu Nian.

295
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,560
She got publicly

296
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,360
dumped today.

297
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,360
While I was meditating at the Meditation Club,

298
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
Gu Nian just burst in.

299
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,320
Then she confronted our Meditation Club president,

300
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,800
an American boy named Peter,

301
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,600
and asked him

302
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,280
why he didn't

303
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,240
meet her at the library for their date.

304
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,040
Then that boy told her right there,

305
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,840
saying 'You're a boring person.'

306
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,200
'Everything you do is boring,

307
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,280
we're done.'

308
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
In front of more than ten people from the Meditation Club,

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,360
he humiliated her so badly she wanted to disappear.

310
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,160
The scene was absolutely brutal.

311
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,880
Why don't you have any reaction?

312
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm not surprised at all.

313
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,760
Are you not surprised that Gu Nian is boring,

314
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,560
or not surprised that she got dumped?

315
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,640
This kind of thing happening to Gu Nian

316
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,760
is pretty normal.

317
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,400
That's really harsh.

318
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Well, someone has to tell the truth.

319
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
I don't know you, you cold-blooded animal.

320
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
Can I go put my luggage away now?

321
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,490
Yes, you cold-blooded animal.

322
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Venomous snake.

323
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
White-browed pit viper.

324
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,880
Mangshan pit viper.

325
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Bamboo pit viper.

326
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,680
You didn't turn on the lights again,

327
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,940
you scared me to death.

328
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,400
Nian Nian.

329
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Remember when I told you

330
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,400
about the trouble with the club exhibition venue?

331
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,280
But it's all good now,

332
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,480
I've taken care of it.

333
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,240
My mom was right,

334
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,840
people should use their talents.

335
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,340
Why not use my connections if I have them?

336
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,040
Now everyone's happy.

337
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
And you know what,

338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
I contributed to the club

339
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,600
and earned their recognition,

340
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,460
killing two birds with one stone.

341
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,240
What's wrong?

342
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
Why are you crying?

343
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,840
I hate clubs.

344
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,720
Don't mention clubs to me anymore.

345
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,520
Wait, is there a problem with the Meditation Club?

346
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,880
Did something happen at the club?

347
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,610
Tell me and I'll help you fix it.

348
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,760
I hate the Meditation Club.

349
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,080
I'm never going back there again.

350
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,810
Everyone in that club is crazy.

351
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Nian Nian.

352
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,920
Nian Nian.

353
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,080
Would you like to join the Meditation Club?

354
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Here you go.

355
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,250
Hey guys, Meditation Club!

356
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,080
Hey man, interested in meditation?

357
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,520
You should join the Meditation Club.

358
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,240
No thanks.

359
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,280
You should check it out,

360
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,140
once you try it, you'll be hooked.

361
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,360
Are you Peter?

362
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,720
Am I that famous now?

363
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,480
Yes, I'm Peter.

364
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,080
Your poster is huge.

365
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,400
That's me.

366
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,260
Really?

367
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,920
Yes.

368
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,400
I see you have your own activity room now.

369
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,680
We didn't have one before,

370
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,160
but you know we're getting more members now,

371
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,400
so we're sharing with other clubs.

372
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,760
How many members do you have now?

373
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,080
About 30 already.

374
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,360
That's right,

375
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,040
not bad.

376
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,720
Because we have a Chinese student in the club,

377
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,440
the school approved our funding request,

378
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,920
so I repackaged our club's mission

379
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,720
to attract more Asian students.

380
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
That Chinese student is Gu Nian, right?

381
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,520
Do you know each other?

382
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,920
Yes, you know each other.

383
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,600
She's my student.

384
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't know what she told you.

385
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,360
I admit Gu Nian helped me.

386
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
But we're not really compatible.

387
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,160
I've always wanted to take her out

388
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,080
to movies or do other things, but she only wants to study

389
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
or go to the library.

390
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,120
It's such a buzzkill, you know?

391
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
I understand.

392
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,720
Really?

393
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,560
Yes.

394
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
I thought you were going to criticize me.

395
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,080
I won't judge how you handle your relationship

396
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,720
but rejecting her

397
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,680
in front of all the meditation club members

398
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,520
wasn't gentlemanly behavior.

399
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,520
Is she okay?

400
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
I don't know.

401
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,040
If you see her,

402
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,640
could you tell her I'm sorry?

403
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,320
I shouldn't have said those things to her in public.

404
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,780
I can't help you with that.

405
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,200
Am I boring?

406
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,360
So you think so too.

407
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,760
Gu Nian, this question

408
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
isn't appropriate to discuss here.

409
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,560
Am I really boring?

410
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,560
No.

411
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
You're lying.

412
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,160
Fine.

413
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,520
Come,

414
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,160
come here.

415
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,680
Professor Zhuo.

416
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,480
I'm asking you seriously,

417
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,120
am I really that boring?

418
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,840
Just tell me,

419
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
I can take it.

420
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,840
Alright, when I was writing the documents,

421
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,770
I did say your life was monotonous.

422
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,160
But didn't you righteously

423
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,440
refute me right then?

424
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,480
You said your life was colorful,

425
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
that you even dated in middle school.

426
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,420
Where did all that confidence go?

427
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,930
I know you're being sarcastic.

428
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,360
I'm really not.

429
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,280
Gu Nian, I'm answering you very seriously.

430
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Could someone who turns the brutal competition

431
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,280
between first and second place

432
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,360
into a story of young love

433
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,480
possibly be boring?

434
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,360
Could someone who had the courage

435
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,840
to save her dream of studying abroad

436
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,100
by secretly traveling

437
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,560
across the ocean without telling her parents

438
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,280
possibly be dull?

439
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,880
Aren't you the one who stood up

440
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,120
to that supervisor bullying newcomers in the kitchen,

441
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,320
yet felt compassion for her tragic life,

442
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
and then was willing to help her

443
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,320
without expecting anything in return?

444
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,880
Isn't this who you are, Gu Nian?

445
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
How vivid and real.

446
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,200
Professor Zhuo, you're only saying this

447
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,820
because I'm your student, right?

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
Have you forgotten?

449
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,120
Have you forgotten the assignment Professor Conway gave you,

450
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,160
and the innovative solution you came up with?

451
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,440
Professor Conway,

452
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,400
he's such an authority who has taught countless students.

453
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,640
Thinking outside the box -

454
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,760
that's not praise

455
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,690
a rigid person would ever receive.

456
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,840
Really?

457
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
Of course.

458
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,040
Thank you, Professor Zhuo.

459
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
Even though I'm saying this,

460
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,960
don't get too proud of yourself.

461
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,560
Ivy,

462
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
you're the first freshman

463
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,480
to ever run for election in our club.

464
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I'm truly impressed.

465
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,120
Thank you. I'm just giving it a try.

466
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,440
Great,

467
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,760
hope you get elected.

468
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,200
I haven't thought that far ahead.

469
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm just happy to be nominated.

470
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
I hope whatever the outcome,

471
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,920
you won't lose your enthusiasm.

472
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,680
Thank you.

473
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,200
No problem.

474
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,720
Bye.

475
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,850
Okay, see you later.

476
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,240
Hi, Nathan.

477
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,360
Dude, is she running for vice president?

478
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,040
Yeah.

479
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
How long has she even been here,

480
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
and she thinks she's qualified

481
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,880
to run for vice president?

482
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,080
Everything's changed since she got here.

483
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,640
Well,

484
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,160
but you know Ivy has contributed a lot to the club.

485
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,280
Contributed?

486
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,160
This club is supposed to be about planning

487
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,880
and student governance.

488
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,720
So shouldn't it be about who has better skills,

489
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,640
not who can spend more money?

490
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
Dude.

491
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,400
Come on.

492
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,920
Mom.

493
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,160
I've officially signed up to run for club vice president.

494
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,840
And our president said

495
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,400
this is the first time ever

496
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,080
a freshman has applied.

497
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,220
Do you think you have a chance?

498
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,680
I think I have a pretty good chance of winning.

499
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,520
Mom, what if

500
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
I get elected both here

501
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,200
and at the Chinese Students Association?

502
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,480
I wouldn't know which one to choose.

503
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,200
What?

504
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,680
Both positions?

505
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,120
That's great!

506
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,580
If you get both, take both,

507
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,000
silly girl.

508
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,760
That's what I was thinking too.

509
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,680
I've got to go now,

510
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,140
I'm at my dorm. Hanging up,

511
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
bye-bye.

512
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,400
If you're not happy, just quit the club,

513
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,040
it's not like there's only one club.

514
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,840
We also have the guitar club and the surfing club.

515
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,360
What? So we're just going to

516
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,760
let that person off the hook?

517
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,440
Max, what do you think?

518
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I think Huang Xin'er is pretty cute.

519
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,000
If she thinks she can win with money,

520
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,480
she's wrong.

521
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,920
But I think money talks.

522
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,360
Right, money makes the world go round.

523
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,280
Let's teach this gold digger a lesson.

524
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,480
Huang Xin'er.

525
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,400
Yes?

526
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,840
This is for you.

527
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,520
Who gave it to you?

528
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,800
I don't know.

529
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,760
Who have I offended now?

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,120
Have you made enemies with someone?

531
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
I don't have any enemies.

532
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,940
I treat everyone as my friend.

533
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,810
A love rival?

534
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
That's possible.

535
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,160
Someone might have a secret crush on me.

536
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,760
So you've never seen

537
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,620
the person who wrote these notes?

538
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,440
No, not even once.

539
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,440
Then there's only one possibility.

540
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,080
What?

541
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,840
Delivered to

542
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
the wrong person?

543
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,960
But I'm so beautiful.

544
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
How could anyone make that mistake?

545
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,840
That's true.

546
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,520
You're inviting me to join the cheerleading squad.

547
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,400
Yes.

548
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,240
But there's never been an Asian girl

549
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,000
on the cheerleading squad before.

550
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,720
Look,

551
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,480
you're one of the prettiest

552
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,240
freshmen this year,

553
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,480
what do you say?

554
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,320
I'd love to. Of course I would.

555
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,360
Great. But you'll need to pay a membership fee,

556
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,520
would you prefer to pay by check or cash?

557
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Do I need a check for just $50?

558
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,520
It's $5,000.

559
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,080
$5,000?

560
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,200
I thought the cheerleading fee

561
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,640
was $50 per year.

562
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,320
Sweetie, this is a historic breakthrough.

563
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,920
You can't expect to pay

564
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,120
the same price as everyone else, right?

565
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,040
Okay, I'll think about it.

566
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
The Crossword Club invites you to join.

567
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,840
If you join,

568
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,640
we'll have enough money to proceed.

569
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,760
The String Quartet Club is the hottest club this year.

570
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,720
You should join us.

571
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,520
You really should join the Meditation Club.

572
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,640
We want to rent a gym for meditation sessions.

573
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,480
Are you guys crazy?

574
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,160
We'd like you to join our club.

575
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,960
Please take a look at our proposal.

576
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,360
The budget and everything else is in there.

577
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,320
Gold digger.

578
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,320
What?

579
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,880
Gold digger.

580
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Gold digger.

581
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,000
It's you.

582
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,080
You're the one who wrote that note.

583
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,000
Why?

584
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,160
Because I can't stand how you use money to push people around.

585
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,360
I'm reporting you to the school for bullying.

586
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,280
But isn't this what you wanted?

587
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,840
Popularity that money can buy.

588
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,680
You've gone too far.

589
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,920
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

590
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,760
It's just a surface wound,

591
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,000
nothing serious.

592
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
But those people who bullied you.

593
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,860
They're really awful.

594
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,000
Easy, easy.

595
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Okay.

596
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,800
They're really terrible.

597
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,280
I never thought it would be those people,

598
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,600
and I've always been so nice to them,

599
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
even buying them food

600
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,880
and desserts and stuff.

601
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,720
Gentle.

602
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,520
Every time I buy them snacks,

603
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,560
they all eat them with such delight.

604
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,040
If you ask me,

605
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,520
you shouldn't run for election

606
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,840
or join so many clubs.

607
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,280
Careful.

608
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,960
Students should focus on their studies.

609
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,640
These clubs

610
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,560
are just the icing on the cake.

611
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,000
Should I give up because of them?

612
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,330
I'd be so disappointed.

613
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,440
Besides,

614
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,880
I've already submitted my election form.

615
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,920
What are you running for?

616
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,040
Vice president of the club.

617
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,120
My chances of success are really high right now,

618
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,440
so I'm not going to give up so easily.

619
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,320
If you ask me,

620
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,080
you shouldn't make things worse,

621
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,960
it's better to let it go now.

622
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,200
What are you doing here?

623
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,800
Just checking out this dorm room,

624
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm planning to move in.

625
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,360
You, get out.

626
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,600
We need to talk.

627
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,960
Okay.

628
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,120
X Gu Nian

629
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,580
Gu Nian.

630
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Don't fight.

631
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,560
Talk it out.

632
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,320
Stay calm, please stay calm.

633
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,840
That's my bed.

634
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Not for long.

635
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,080
What do you mean?

636
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,719
Nathan says you'll crack soon,

637
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,400
and definitely drop out.

638
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,520
I-I'm not dropping out,

639
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,400
I still have the election.

640
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,159
You won't get a single vote.

641
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,280
As long as you stay here,

642
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,880
the game continues.

643
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,960
Trust me, we have plenty of ways to deal with you.

644
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,719
Fine, I'll move out of the dorm,

645
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,760
and I won't run for election,

646
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,320
I'll even quit the Film Memorial Club,

647
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,280
just stop harassing me.

648
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,719
Great,

649
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,560
then this will be my room soon,

650
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,199
perfect.

651
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,560
I have an objection.

652
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,480
What?

653
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,640
I don't want to be your roommate.

654
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,600
What are you talking about?

655
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,920
You're so rude, you know that?

656
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
Someone like you,

657
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,440
who only knows how to bully others,

658
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,640
and doesn't care about studying at all,

659
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,520
would definitely disturb my studies if you moved in.

660
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,200
I came all the way from China to America

661
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,240
just to study hard,

662
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
and I absolutely cannot let people like you

663
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
affect my studies,

664
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,200
so I firmly refuse

665
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,730
to let you live in this dorm.

666
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
What on earth are you saying?

667
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,040
I can't be your roommate,

668
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,360
get out of my study space.

669
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,200
God, what's wrong with you?

670
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Huang Xin'er, remember what you said.

671
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,440
She didn't promise you anything.

672
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,840
Huang Xin'er isn't going anywhere,

673
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,320
and she won't give up the election either.

674
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,400
You'll see.

675
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,200
Gu Nian, Gu Nian, are you okay?

676
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,440
I'm fine.

677
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,170
Do you think she'll come back tonight?

678
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
P-probably not.

679
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,120
You just told her

680
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,650
that I would definitely run for the election.

681
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,720
Did you tell them?

682
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
You already did.

683
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,040
Then join in.

684
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,840
You've already given your word,

685
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,640
so you have to go through with it.

686
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,360
Good luck.

687
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,860
You can do this. Don't mind their stares,

688
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,370
just focus on your goal.

689
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,480
All right.

690
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,280
All vice president candidates are now in position.

691
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,800
Let's have the ladies go first,

692
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,120
come on up, Ivy.

693
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,440
Good luck.

694
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,000
Gold digger.

695
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,320
Gold digger.

696
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,440
I want to run for vice president of the club.

697
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,840
The Image Memorial Club is the only

698
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,120
exhibition curation club at St. Helen University.

699
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,800
Since I joined the planning committee.

700
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I...

701
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:10,640
I've been dedicated to creating a lively atmosphere in the club.

702
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,280
This time I've also solved the venue issue for everyone.

703
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Right, you're really good at spending money.

704
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,400
Money talks, doesn't it?

705
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,760
Gold digger.

706
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
You're nothing but a gold digger,

707
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,040
nothing more than that.

708
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,840
That's your only contribution,

709
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,280
money makes you prettier than others.

710
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,880
Gold digger, gold digger.

711
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,600
Gold digger, gold digger, gold digger.

712
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:55,240
Gold digger, gold digger, gold digger.

713
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,040
Xin'er.

714
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Gold digger, gold digger.

715
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,280
Xin'er.

716
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,680
Xin'er, Xin'er.

717
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,760
Xin'er,

718
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,290
why haven't you eaten anything for lunch?

719
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,680
I have no appetite.

720
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,040
If you don't want to eat, at least have some soup.

721
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,200
Careful, it's hot.

722
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,800
Xin'er, you need to take care of yourself

723
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,640
if something's bothering you, talk about it

724
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,440
don't keep it bottled up inside.

725
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,840
It's nothing.

726
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,760
Thank you for coming to see me.

727
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,200
Xin'er, if you're feeling down

728
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,080
or can't sleep at night and need someone to talk to

729
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,480
you can visit the counseling department.

730
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,720
When I was applying for my doctorate, I was under a lot of stress

731
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,520
and couldn't sleep for nights on end.

732
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
Every time I talked with them

733
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,220
it was really helpful.

734
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,120
Really? That sounds good.

735
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
What's good about it?

736
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,160
Applying for a doctorate

737
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,600
and being bullied are two completely different things.

738
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,840
When you're treated unfairly

739
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,760
is counseling really

740
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,000
the only option we have?

741
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Isn't there anything else we can do?

742
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,280
Nian Nian, what are you saying?

743
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,320
They went too far.

744
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
We can't just let this go.

745
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,640
Keep your voice down.

746
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,680
Enough, stop talking about it.

747
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,080
I'll just avoid them from now on

748
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,280
and quit the club too.

749
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,880
What if they bully you again?

750
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,040
Stop talking. I want to sleep now.

751
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,000
Nian Nian, what's going on?

752
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,520
We've been trying to persuade her,

753
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,450
isn't it all for Xin'er's own good?

754
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Besides, Xin'er already said

755
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
to let this matter go

756
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,680
and she just wants some peace.

757
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,740
But you're just stirring up trouble.

758
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,720
Don't you love studying?

759
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,840
Then focus on your studies,

760
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,170
mind your own business,

761
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,000
and stop meddling in other affairs.

762
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,320
Take good care of her,

763
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,130
we'll come visit her often.

764
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,680
Let's go.

765
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,160
You drive, I'll shoot.

766
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,920
So there are two fish in a tank,

767
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,280
and one says,

768
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,880
"Hey buddy, how's it going?"

769
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,480
The other one says, "Oh my God! A talking fish!"

770
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,250
Xu Wei, someone's looking for you.

771
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,840
What is it, Gu Nian?

772
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,880
I was wondering

773
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,960
if the Chinese Students Association could

774
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
step in and help Xin'er get justice.

775
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,400
The Chinese Students Association doesn't exist

776
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,800
to fight students' battles.

777
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,880
Then what is it for?

778
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,360
Is it just for socializing

779
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,520
and fancy dinners?

780
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,520
Is that really what you think of the Chinese Students Association?

781
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,800
When I first came to this school,

782
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,720
everyone told me

783
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,640
that the Chinese Students Association was a safe harbor for international students,

784
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,280
that we could turn to them with any problem.

785
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,840
But when something actually happens,

786
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,160
you just go through the motions

787
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,960
with meaningless condolences?

788
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,880
Gu Nian,

789
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,180
Huang Xin'er wants to let this go.

790
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,800
Why are you still making a fuss?

791
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,320
What she needs now is rest,

792
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,360
to peacefully get through this difficult time.

793
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,960
No,

794
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,520
I don't think she needs rest.

795
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,980
What she needs is respect.

796
