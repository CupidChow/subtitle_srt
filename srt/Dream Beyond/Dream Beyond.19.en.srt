1
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,960
If you're really interested,

2
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,020
I suggest reading the original text.

3
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,580
I'm surprised,

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Mr. Zhuo, you enjoy reading too.

5
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,120
So before going abroad, what did you do here?

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
I majored in Chinese literature in college,

7
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,320
and worked at the National Research Institute before going abroad.

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,240
Then you're quite the scholar of our generation,

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm impressed.

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,420
You flatter me.

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,120
Then your child must be a top student, right?

12
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
Yes,

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,800
he graduated from St. Helen University with a computer science degree

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,060
on a full scholarship.

15
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,960
By the way, Professor Zhuo,

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,690
did you notice Xu Wei's injuries this afternoon?

17
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,460
I don't think those are just ordinary injuries.

18
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,060
It looks like domestic violence.

19
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,160
Do you think David will show up tonight?

20
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,360
I've made myself very clear.

21
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,800
Now it depends on whether David

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,530
believes that Cui Fengjun will give in tomorrow.

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
Tonight is David's last chance

24
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,800
to stop Cui Fengjun.

25
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Was that phone call this afternoon

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,960
really from Professor Chris?

27
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,200
It was an alarm.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,120
Hello, Professor Chris.

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,120
I was wondering how it could be such a coincidence,

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
that at this critical moment,

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Cui Fengjun suddenly gave in.

32
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,329
I deliberately said those things for him to hear.

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,140
Did you notice his reaction at that time?

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
Hello, Professor Chris.

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
Really? Cui Fengjun's resistance has decreased?

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,460
That shows your treatment has been very effective.

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
Good.

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay.

39
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,640
You're saying there's more to the story about his attack?

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,320
I understand.

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,280
That's great news.

42
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,079
You're hoping for a breakthrough in tomorrow's session.

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Alright, that's excellent.

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,760
Looking forward to meeting tomorrow.

45
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,640
Okay, goodbye.

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,020
It seems there's really a turning point.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,720
I think he took the bait.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
Let's hope so.

49
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,159
Now we can only wait for the results.

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,920
If he shows up tonight,

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,050
then there's nothing more to discuss.

52
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
If he doesn't show up,

53
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,210
perhaps our judgment was wrong after all.

54
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,480
Here.

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,730
Thank you for helping me so much today.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't mention it.

57
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,320
Your daughter almost exposed us,

58
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,930
fortunately she had a change of heart.

59
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,120
You think she's really had a change of heart

60
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
and stopped opposing me?

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,920
She probably has some new trick waiting for me.

62
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't they say that

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,880
daughters are their mother's

64
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,159
little darlings?

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,760
In other families, they're darlings,

66
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,720
so why not in mine?

67
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,400
But who can I blame?

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,159
I chose my husband,

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,170
and I gave birth to my daughter.

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
That's some deep self-reflection.

71
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,440
Come on, tell me about yourself.

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,530
What do you mean?

73
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,400
Your spouse has been gone for so long,

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,120
and you've been both father and mother,

75
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,980
haven't you thought about finding someone new?

76
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,490
For my child's sake,

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,820
I'd rather not.

78
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,840
What's wrong?

79
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Afraid your child would object?

80
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,520
Actually, I know that

81
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,840
my son has always resented me

82
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,880
because he must have thought

83
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
I was having an affair,

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
which caused his mother such distress

85
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
that she became distracted

86
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,220
and had that accident.

87
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,620
In that case, it would be hard for your child to accept a new mother.

88
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
But did you really have an affair back then?

89
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,320
Why are you being so nosy?

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,640
So it was true.

91
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
My impression of you just got worse again.

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
Why are all men the same?

93
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,980
Anyone who hears this would misunderstand.

94
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,880
Everyone thinks it was my fault,

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,820
let alone a five-year-old child.

96
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
If you really didn't have an affair,

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,680
why didn't you explain it to your child?

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,920
But at that time, the child was so young,

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,600
only five when he lost his mother.

100
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,010
He was already pitiful enough.

101
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
So...

102
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,240
Yes, he was young then,

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
but how old is he now?

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Why don't you clear things up?

105
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,680
You've been carrying this burden for so long.

106
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,880
Some things, if not clarified at the time,

107
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,600
may never have a chance to be explained later.

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,200
That's true.

109
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,600
It's always easier to talk about other people's problems,

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,130
only when it happens to yourself do you know how difficult it is.

111
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,280
Then I can only wish that your name will be cleared soon.

112
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,060
I appreciate your kind words.

113
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
If that day really comes,

114
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
I hope I'll have the chance to

115
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,920
share a drink with you again.

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,680
Cheers.

117
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,400
Mr. Zhuo, someone's coming out.

118
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,120
I see them.

119
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,480
Is that him? I can't see his face clearly.

120
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,120
I think it is.

121
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,480
That's David's car.

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,850
They're leaving. Let's follow them quickly.

123
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
That's not Cui Fengjun.

124
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,800
Could we have been wrong?

125
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,360
We can't jump to conclusions yet,

126
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,160
let's keep watching for a while.

127
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,240
Alright, since our target has appeared,

128
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
let's keep an eye on him a bit longer.

129
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
I'm hungry again.

130
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
So hungry.

131
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
How about I get you something to eat?

132
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,960
Sure.

133
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,100
Don't let David out of your sight,

134
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,980
call my cell if anything happens.

135
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,260
Don't worry, I'll stay at my post.

136
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,160
Alright.

137
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,060
Where's David?

138
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,090
Why has he disappeared?

139
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
Should I go in or not?

140
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,760
Right, I can't let him out of my sight.

141
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,560
Where is he?

142
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Oh my god! You scared me to death!

143
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,160
Hey, Gu Nian, Gu Nian!

144
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,520
What's wrong?

145
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,280
I just noticed David was gone

146
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,120
so I went in to find him,

147
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
but he was in the bathroom,

148
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
and we nearly bumped into each other face to face.

149
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
It scared me to death.

150
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,320
Are they not leaving anymore?

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,250
Get in. Let's keep following them.

152
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,900
Do you think we might be wrong about this?

153
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,980
Let's wait and see.

154
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
If you're tired, get some sleep.

155
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,600
No, no,

156
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,860
we agreed to fight this battle together.

157
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh no,

158
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,720
I fell asleep?

159
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,540
I've been watching the whole time. Don't worry.

160
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,280
Any developments?

161
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,680
He's been at home the whole time, never left.

162
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
Could it not be him?

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,040
I don't know.

164
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,240
It's already 6 o'clock.

165
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,920
The sun is up.

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
Waiting any longer won't get us anywhere.

167
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,170
Let's go back and catch some sleep.

168
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,400
Professor Chris.

169
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,880
Zhuopeng, come to the counseling department.

170
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,940
Cui Fengjun has been attacked again.

171
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
What?

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
Chris, what happened to Cui Fengjun?

173
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
Have a seat.

174
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,320
You look a bit sleep-deprived, don't you?

175
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,960
Yes.

176
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,980
He's been attacked again.

177
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
Do you have an alibi this time?

178
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,250
This could be a good chance to clear your name.

179
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,160
Where were you last night?

180
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,080
Was anyone with you?

181
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,200
Yes, there was.

182
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,640
That's good news.

183
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,800
Because Cui Fengjun's testimony keeps changing,

184
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
the location of the attack, the timeline,

185
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,000
and so on keep changing,

186
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
which really hinders the investigation.

187
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,120
Now that he's been attacked again,

188
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
it might actually be good for you.

189
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,480
Do you know where he was attacked?

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I don't know,

191
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,010
but everything I'm telling you is insider information.

192
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,040
I understand.

193
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,680
Thank you.

194
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,960
Bye.

195
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,200
Chris.

196
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you know where Cui Fengjun is now?

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,930
He's taken leave and is at home now.

198
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
Are you awake? I'm coming to pick you up now.

199
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,930
We need to find Cui Fengjun.

200
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,940
We have something important to tell you.

201
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
Teacher Zhuo was beaten so badly.

202
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,760
Talk.

203
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
This time you can't say I was the one who beat you, right?

204
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,330
I don't understand.

205
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,280
I'm sorry that you got beaten by David again because of me.

206
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,320
Who said David beat me?

207
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,360
I deliberately told David

208
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,160
that you might give in

209
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,040
and reveal who attacked you.

210
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,080
I understand.

211
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,480
Why did David say I was going to betray him?

212
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,920
So it really was David who beat you?

213
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,840
Who else?

214
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,620
We were just guessing before.

215
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,840
You guys

216
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,280
are clever.

217
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
So you're admitting

218
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,720
that David was the one who beat you both times.

219
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,400
You're the ones who hurt me.

220
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,680
We hurt you?

221
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,360
You were the one sending harassing emails to Xu Wei,

222
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,320
all of this is your own doing.

223
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,130
Not just harassing emails,

224
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,720
you must have done something worse.

225
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,760
You insulted Xu Wei

226
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,920
specifically about her marrying a white man.

227
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
David has already called the police

228
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,240
and demanded you undergo mandatory psychological treatment.

229
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,320
He didn't attack you because of that.

230
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,020
Actually, you were beaten

231
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,680
because you refused to stop.

232
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Instead, you escalated by stalking Xu Wei.

233
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,960
But you didn't expect

234
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,490
that you would discover Xu Wei's domestic abuse secret.

235
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,460
You even used this to threaten Xu Wei,

236
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,680
which is what led David to attack you.

237
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,240
It seems David

238
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
really did hit Xu Wei.

239
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
I insulted Xu Wei.

240
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,320
Fine, my fault.

241
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,520
David.

242
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Good person, good man.

243
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,200
Goes home and beats his wife.

244
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
Psycho.

245
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,620
But you didn't expect David would come looking for you.

246
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
No, I didn't.

247
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,920
He's terrifying.

248
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,700
Are there any other memory cards?

249
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Okay.

250
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,680
I believe you.

251
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,760
But if I find out

252
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,440
that you've lied to me,

253
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,640
the punishment won't be limited to today's scale.

254
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,680
If I expose you,

255
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,920
you won't get away with it either.

256
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,520
I have nothing to fear.

257
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm just a student,

258
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
while you're a renowned biologist.

259
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,440
You not only abuse your wife and assault students,

260
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,880
you'll go to prison.

261
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,900
You reminded me of something.

262
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,850
You're a third-year biology student, right?

263
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,490
What are your plans after graduation?

264
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,640
If you plan to continue in biology or pharmaceuticals

265
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,280
down this career path,

266
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,240
then you'll definitely run into me.

267
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,920
Now, if you behave yourself,

268
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,410
there will be benefits.

269
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Otherwise...

270
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,200
You're a smart person.

271
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,920
You understand.

272
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
I remember now.

273
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,560
That day in the counseling department,

274
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,080
you were terrified when you saw Professor Zhuo.

275
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,840
Actually, you weren't afraid of Professor Zhuo at all,

276
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,800
but of David standing behind him.

277
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,240
So you were afraid of David at that time.

278
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,560
Fine, I understand why you won't testify against him,

279
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,200
but why frame me?

280
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,960
I don't like you.

281
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,960
You got Professor Zhuo suspended.

282
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,220
But your testimony is all over the place,

283
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,640
it doesn't even come close to

284
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
telling a coherent story.

285
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Overthinking makes you unhappy.

286
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,400
So are you happy now that you've been beaten up?

287
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,840
It's your fault I got beaten up again.

288
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,520
Us?

289
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,960
We saw David outside your building last night,

290
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,440
but he wasn't meeting you.

291
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,600
We waited all night.

292
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,130
What's really going on?

293
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,880
Last night,

294
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,000
David called me,

295
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,960
he asked me to meet him,

296
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,120
said he needed to discuss something with me.

297
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,840
Since the school is still investigating,

298
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,360
he specifically told me not to be seen,

299
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,000
told me to wait in the alley behind the fast food place.

300
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,720
I didn't expect him to immediately ask me

301
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,800
if I was going to change my testimony.

302
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,920
No matter how much I denied it,

303
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
he wouldn't believe me.

304
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,720
That's all.

305
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Let's go.

306
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,420
We didn't come here to listen to stories,

307
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,720
we need you to step up and testify against David.

308
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,920
Do you really want to spend

309
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,850
your whole life under his threats?

310
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,900
You want me to testify against David.

311
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,160
It's for your own sake.

312
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,560
No, no, no. I can't.

313
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
He threatened me,

314
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,480
the evidence is gone,

315
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,440
and nobody will believe me.

316
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
You should find Xu Wei,

317
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
stop putting me in danger.

318
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,960
If you keep hurting me, I'll tell David

319
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,440
that you know everything.

320
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,040
I can't believe David took the chance

321
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,280
to beat up Cui Fengjun while he was in the bathroom.

322
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,160
He came back after the assault so calmly,

323
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,240
without showing any signs of guilt or unusual behavior.

324
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,500
Cui Fengjun was right,

325
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,010
this man is terrifying.

326
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,360
Xu Wei suffers from David's domestic violence at home.

327
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,890
It's truly heartbreaking.

328
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,080
We need to help her.

329
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,080
Let's call the police.

330
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Yes, the police.

331
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,280
Don't rush.

332
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,560
Xu Wei isn't someone who doesn't know the law.

333
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,080
She's been keeping the domestic violence hidden,

334
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,440
she must have her reasons.

335
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,720
But what reasons could she possibly have?

336
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,250
I really can't think of any.

337
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,760
We can't just ignore this situation.

338
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,360
I'll call Xu Wei and ask her about it.

339
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,220
Let's not rush into this, Gu Nian.

340
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,420
This matter is too sensitive.

341
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,960
I think we should

342
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,220
avoid visiting Xu Wei at her home for now.

343
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,160
Then let's invite her out for a meal.

344
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,620
Let's hold off for a while,

345
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,760
so David doesn't get suspicious.

346
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,010
Okay, I'll follow your advice.

347
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,080
I'll take you home so you can catch up on sleep.

348
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
More like catch up on homework.

349
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,960
Hey.

350
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,000
Um.

351
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,400
I can do your homework for you.

352
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,040
What? You want to do my homework?

353
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Yes.

354
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,250
Since you've been fighting alongside me,

355
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,220
this homework,

356
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,920
Teacher Zhuo will take care of it for you.

357
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,840
Doing someone else's homework?

358
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
Teacher Zhuo, how could you do such a thing?

359
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,730
What's wrong with that?

360
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,200
Can't I do something unprincipled for once?

361
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,120
No way.

362
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,880
Teacher Zhuo has very high standards,

363
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,210
he would never do anything unprincipled.

364
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,770
See? I knew you were lying to me.

365
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,560
Let's go.

366
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,540
How's it going?

367
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,840
When I get something good, you're the first person I think of.

368
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
This lens is the latest model,

369
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,920
the image quality is outstanding,

370
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,520
truly excellent.

371
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,720
But the price is a bit steep.

372
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
If you use your bank card for installment payments,

373
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,650
the financial pressure won't be so heavy.

374
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,480
Since you're a regular customer,

375
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,840
tell you what, if you want it,

376
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,800
I can give you a discount.

377
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,320
Okay, sure.

378
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,480
But can I think about it a bit more?

379
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
No problem.

380
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,280
Honey.

381
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,260
Where did you get this new camera?

382
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,080
Just bought it. Cool, right?

383
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,600
Here,

384
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,600
let me take a photo of you.

385
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,320
Just like that,

386
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,880
don't move.

387
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
How much was it?

388
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,200
Just a little over our budget.

389
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,880
I put it on installments with my credit card,

390
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,840
no pressure.

391
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,340
How much is 'a little'?

392
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,960
Definitely within our budget,

393
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,840
and there's a discount on the processing fee.

394
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,360
Don't be such a killjoy,

395
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,890
give me a smile. Come on.

396
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,560
Three, two, one, go.

397
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Why didn't you

398
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,520
discuss it with me before buying the camera?

399
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm telling you now,

400
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,480
aren't I?

401
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
Didn't we agree

402
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,600
to give each other a heads-up

403
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
when buying expensive items?

404
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,560
Are we still saving for our wedding?

405
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,440
Yes, yes, yes,

406
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,160
I know, but this thing,

407
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
I mean, definitely.

408
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,080
I know,

409
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,800
I know I violated

410
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,130
our savings agreement.

411
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,000
But it's just this one time in all these years,

412
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,240
besides the camera,

413
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,290
I won't randomly buy other things.

414
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,020
Next time, no acting first and reporting later.

415
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,570
I've bought something too.

416
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,680
What did you buy?

417
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,880
Here

418
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,800
you go.

419
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,960
What's this? You're being so mysterious.

420
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,720
Come on, let me see

421
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,200
what surprise you've got.

422
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,400
Looks nice, right?

423
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,440
There's more.

424
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,520
Wow, this one is impressive.

425
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,360
Wait, how much did these two cost?

426
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,760
I went a little over budget.

427
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,600
These two

428
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,200
These pieces of junk are so expensive?

429
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,680
What do you mean by 'junk'?

430
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,680
I haven't bought new clothes in two years.

431
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,800
Fine, buying clothes is one thing,

432
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,730
but what is this?

433
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,480
It's even more expensive than proper clothes.

434
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,960
Don't you like it too?

435
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But it's not a necessity.

436
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,130
This isn't a necessity,

437
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,640
so your camera is a necessity?

438
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,080
You really don't get it.

439
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,680
I could take good photos with my camera

440
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,560
and possibly make money from them.

441
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,480
Besides,

442
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,280
you know photography is my only hobby.

443
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,360
But for our future,

444
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,400
I haven't bought a single one in all these years.

445
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I've been living frugally every day,

446
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,960
and finally saved up some money,

447
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,620
just to treat myself a little.

448
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,700
Just carry the camera across.

449
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,840
Liu Juan.

450
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,240
Liu Juan.

451
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,560
Hey.

452
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,840
Today,

453
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,580
you can just stay here and make yourself at home.

454
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,000
Sorry to bother you, Nian Nian.

455
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,360
I really feel bad about this.

456
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
What's there to feel bad about?

457
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,280
I couldn't be happier to have you here.

458
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,680
It's just that you left him all alone there,

459
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,160
which seems a bit pitiful.

460
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,890
What's there to pity about him?

461
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
He's more interested in cameras now

462
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,080
than he is in me.

463
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,840
You know, when two people have been together for a long time,

464
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,120
especially these past two years,

465
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,280
he's been working so hard and gets tired.

466
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,720
I completely understand.

467
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,360
That's why I bought some things,

468
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
hoping to add some spice to our life.

469
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
But he doesn't get it.

470
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,000
He doesn't even know where the problem is,

471
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,560
he just gets angry and accuses me of wasting money.

472
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,120
What did you buy that made him so upset?

473
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,840
Let me show you,

474
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,100
but don't tell anyone.

475
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,680
I won't, I won't.

476
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,520
Sexy.

477
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,520
Great figure.

478
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,250
Quick, put it away, put it away!

479
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
Wow, I wouldn't have guessed.

480
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
You dress so modestly usually,

481
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,400
turns out you're hiding your true self.

482
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,720
Cheeky!

483
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,760
When you fall in love someday,

484
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,890
you'll understand.

485
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,560
Don't worry, he'll definitely come to make up with you tomorrow.

486
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,920
I'm not going to pay him any attention.

487
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,280
I need to teach him a lesson.

488
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,140
I don't believe that for a second.

489
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,480
Alright, alright, go change your clothes now.

490
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,040
Okay, I'll go change then.

491
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,500
Zhuo Peng, Gu Nian.

492
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,520
Xu Wei.

493
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,480
Why did you guys suddenly

494
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,280
message me about having dinner?

495
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm unemployed, you know.

496
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,260
We were passing by and thought of you.

497
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,120
Let's go then. It's been a while since we ate together.

498
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,840
Let's go.

499
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,000
We saw Cui Fengjun today.

500
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,170
What happened? Did he finally say something?

501
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,700
He was beaten up again.

502
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,320
How could he be beaten up again?

503
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,920
Did they catch the attacker?

504
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,280
No.

505
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Did he offend someone?

506
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,520
What's wrong?

507
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,260
Is there something you can't tell me?

508
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
David was the one who beat him up.

509
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,690
That's impossible.

510
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,970
Why would David attack him?

511
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,280
Just because of some harassing emails?

512
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,600
That doesn't make sense.

513
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,530
It can't be true.

514
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,450
These are Cui Fengjun's injuries.

515
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,480
If David really did beat him up,

516
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
why wouldn't he just go to the police?

517
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,720
Because David threatened him

518
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,680
with his academic future.

519
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,880
That's just hearsay. He could frame anyone he wants.

520
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,840
Don't forget

521
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,120
he just falsely accused you.

522
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,560
How come you're now doing

523
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,210
the same thing, falsely accusing others?

524
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,200
Because the reason he got beaten up has to do with you.

525
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,120
So you're saying Cui Fengjun sent me harassing emails,

526
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,719
David resented him for that,

527
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,159
and then went after him?

528
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,219
If David really wanted to beat him up,

529
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,159
we wouldn't have put him through

530
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,840
mandatory psychological treatment in the first place, right?

531
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,719
After Cui Fengjun began his mandatory psychological treatment.

532
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,040
He went even further

533
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,699
and started stalking you,

534
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,239
and

535
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,320
he took photos of David abusing you,

536
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,800
then sent them to you both, right?

537
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

538
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,600
Senior.

539
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,000
I saw the injuries on your hand when I visited your place that day,

540
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,929
why are you still covering for him?

541
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,010
You've got it wrong,

542
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,159
I accidentally hurt myself while working out.

543
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,120
What I said at your place that day

544
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,120
about Cui Fengjun possibly giving in

545
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,280
was a lie,

546
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,400
I deliberately said it so David would hear.

547
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
You deliberately said it for David to hear.

548
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,160
Yes,

549
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,560
but after he heard it,

550
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,440
Cui Fengjun was beaten up again shortly after.

551
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,880
Did you actually see

552
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,410
David beating Cui Fengjun?

553
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,800
No.

554
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,850
Then what makes you think he did it?

555
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,480
Whether David beat him isn't the point,

556
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520
the point is that we care about you

557
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,050
and want to know if David has been abusing you.

558
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,280
He has, hasn't he?

559
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,000
David has had a couple of times

560
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,320
when he got really emotional,

561
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,650
and one time it could be considered abuse.

562
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,760
Xu Wei.

563
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,400
According to Chinese legal definition,

564
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,320
domestic violence occurs between family members

565
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,920
through beating, confinement, binding, abuse,

566
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,920
or other forms against family members

567
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,800
causing psychological, physical, sexual

568
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,200
harm and devastation.

569
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,360
In the US, it's much simpler.

570
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,240
Any physical violence

571
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,200
constitutes domestic abuse.

572
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,600
If David has laid his hands on you even once,

573
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
that's already domestic violence.

574
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,560
Senior.

575
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,290
Do you have some difficult situation?

576
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,360
Do you know what marriage is?

577
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,600
Dating someone

578
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,760
and marrying someone

579
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,680
are completely different things.

580
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,480
When dating, you can do whatever you want,

581
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,280
if you get along well, you're inseparable,

582
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
if not, you just go your separate ways.

583
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,490
But marriage is different,

584
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
marriage binds two people from completely different backgrounds

585
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
together.

586
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,200
It's not just about two people loving each other,

587
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,360
it's more about when facing each other's flaws,

588
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,480
learning to be tolerant of each other.

589
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,280
You need to learn to be accepting.

590
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,160
But we're talking about domestic violence now,

591
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,760
domestic violence is not acceptable.

592
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,890
I know David's personality very well,

593
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,680
he'll change if he's made a mistake.

594
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,800
The matters between us as husband and wife

595
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,530
I don't expect outsiders like you to understand.

596
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,600
As for you saying David hit Cui Fengjun,

597
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,290
I believe he's not that kind of person.

598
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,040
I'm happy that you came to have lunch with me today,

599
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,160
I really am.

600
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,840
But if it's to make me

601
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,970
add false accusations against David,

602
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,290
then there's no need to continue this conversation.

603
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,760
Honey!

604
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,240
Where are you going?

605
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
None of your business!

606
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,960
Stop this,

607
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,080
you can't keep dwelling on that.

608
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,440
It's not your concern!

609
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,840
Honey, I was wrong.

610
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

611
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,680
I shouldn't have spent money on that camera.

612
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,800
I was too selfish.

613
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,080
Please don't be angry, okay?

614
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,480
Don't you understand?

615
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,680
This isn't about the camera.

616
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,240
Honey, honey.

617
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

618
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
It's all my fault.

619
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,690
I'm angry about your selfishness,

620
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,760
you treat that camera like a treasure, but what about me...

621
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,880
I know I was insensitive,

622
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,730
I ruined your good intentions.

623
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,200
I know I was wrong,

624
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,570
and I've already returned the camera.

625
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Returned it?

626
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,160
This whole situation

627
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,040
happened because I didn't discuss it with you

628
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,880
and bought the camera on my own.

629
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,490
I'm begging you,

630
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
please forgive me,

631
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,840
don't be angry anymore, please.

632
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,000
Honey.

633
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,360
Sit down, please sit,

634
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,120
come here,

635
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,800
please, have a seat.

636
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm not trying to make excuses,

637
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,490
I've been really anxious these past few days,

638
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,020
my mind is full of worries.

639
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
So,

640
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,920
I thought about buying myself

641
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,320
something I really wanted,

642
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,480
to make myself feel a little better.

643
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,980
Is it about the overseas assignment?

644
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,760
Yes, the results will be out in a few days.

645
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,520
Your company's assignments

646
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,250
are always to far places like Southeast Asia,

647
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,920
we'd barely see each other all year.

648
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,360
But if I really get sent abroad, that would be good,

649
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,720
at least it would secure my status and job.

650
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,880
We need to think long-term.

651
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,540
It always comes back to

652
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
this work visa issue,

653
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,810
having to rely on some lottery system,

654
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,280
it's so unreliable.

655
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,960
Otherwise, with how hard you work,

656
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,820
they'd definitely give it to you.

657
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,680
You're still thinking about

658
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,320
not winning the lottery draw earlier this year.

659
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,450
I've already settled for second best.

660
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,640
I just hope

661
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
the company will give me the overseas assignment,

662
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,920
so I can hang in there until April next year

663
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,160
and try my luck again.

664
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,920
You need to stay positive.

665
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,580
The overseas assignment will work out for sure.

666
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,960
Xu Wei.

667
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,440
Any new developments lately?

668
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,160
Professor Chen, the first cycle showed good drug efficacy.

669
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,840
However,

670
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
after entering the second observation cycle,

671
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,640
we haven't seen any new progress.

672
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,170
This is already a significant breakthrough.

673
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,680
Our previous experiments

674
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,400
never even made it past the first cycle.

675
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,780
Once the drug development succeeds,

676
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
it will benefit patients across Asia.

677
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,920
That's the true value of the data, isn't it?

678
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,520
David and I, from day one,

679
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,160
have never been in this for profit.

680
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
The final results of our research will definitely

681
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,120
be introduced to the Asian market

682
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,480
to benefit more patients.

683
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,360
You're so young yet have such noble aspirations,

684
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,880
willing to give up fame and fortune

685
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,280
for the greater good.

686
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,240
I'm very pleased.

687
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,640
Come, breakfast is ready.

688
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Haven't you received the email yet?

689
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,760
Don't worry,

690
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,440
you've worked the most overtime in the company these past six months,

691
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,280
and your performance is the best in the entire team.

692
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,000
If the company doesn't keep you, who would they keep?

693
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,720
There's a bunch of PhDs waiting in line,

694
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,360
and I'm just a master's student.

695
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,760
If I don't work this hard,

696
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,040
the company definitely won't keep me.

697
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,080
I should have studied electrical engineering.

698
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,720
Without a work visa now,

699
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,120
I can't submit my application,

700
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,080
and without submitting an application,

701
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,240
nothing can be done.

702
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,040
It's not necessarily that absolute.

703
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,960
Having a job is already pretty good.

704
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,920
Even with a job, you wouldn't dare buy a house here.

705
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,560
Back in 2008, my cousin's friend

706
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,720
was working here.

707
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,720
Then he took leave to visit family in China,

708
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,980
and just as he arrived,

709
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,760
the company started layoffs and fired him.

710
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,880
The problem was

711
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,140
this guy had already bought a house here.

712
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,840
So he did everything possible

713
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,800
to come back and sell the house,

714
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,860
and then fled back to China in a panic.

715
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,240
Without a green card,

716
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,480
you just can't live

717
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,280
with any real peace of mind here.
