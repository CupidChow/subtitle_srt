1
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,240
The environment here is quite nice, isn't it?

2
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
Oh my God.

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
That's where we were before, right?

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,620
Yes, that's right.

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
We just came from over there.

7
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,730
Alright, Betty,

8
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
sit down now,

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,300
don't get too excited.

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,080
You need to rest,

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,880
otherwise you'll be exhausted from jet lag tomorrow,

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,039
and if you still want to go out,

13
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,440
it'll all be for nothing.

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,560
Sir, here's our menu,

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,620
please take a look.

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Give us a few minutes.

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,600
Certainly,

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,480
why don't you and Betty rest at the hotel tomorrow,

19
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,440
I need to go out and take care of something.

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,079
Okay.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,370
Where are you going?

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,820
I have my own plans.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Then I'll go with you.

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Where are you going?

25
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Did you guys hear a familiar voice,

26
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,079
like I'm hearing things?

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,079
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,680
I have a restraining order,

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,740
you must stay 200 meters away from me.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
This is Beijing.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,260
Your restraining order is no longer valid here.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,320
You all knew about this?

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
You're all in this together.

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,240
Oh my God,

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,040
I can't stay with you people anymore.

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
You're all terrible,

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
terrible.

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Alright.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Great! So you're back

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,340
How long are you planning to stay in Beijing?

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,480
Since you're back,

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
why not stay until after the New Year?

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,540
That's wonderful!

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,280
Here.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,620
See what you'd like to eat.

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
When did you get back?

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,680
Why are you just now telling your aunt?

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,340
I just got back today, Auntie.

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,520
As long as you didn't forget about me.

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
How could I possibly forget you?

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,690
You're my only family in China.

52
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,600
By the way, Auntie,

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,880
when will you be home?

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Just come over whenever you want,

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll cook something delicious for you.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,730
Sounds good!

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,880
My dad is back too,

58
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,000
and...

59
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,160
What's that man doing back here?

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,079
He's not welcome in our family.

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
Auntie,

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
it's been over twenty years,

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
and my dad has actually been thinking about...

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,290
Enough, don't say anymore.

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,120
You're welcome anytime,

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,760
but that man can stay away.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,560
Alright, alright.

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,640
Bye-bye.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,250
What did she say?

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,720
She didn't say much.

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,930
I understand

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
it's normal.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,560
Then I won't go over tomorrow.

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Dad, don't take it too seriously,

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
it's been so many years,

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
someone had to break the ice, right?

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
I think you could use this opportunity

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
to repair your relationship with the You family,

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,850
after all, we're still family.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Forget it,

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,880
I know her temper,

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,020
better not go and make everyone uncomfortable.

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,240
Nian Nian.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
Do you remember what we

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,280
talked about at home?

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
I remember.

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,320
You're about the same age as him,

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,400
and you have study abroad experience,

89
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,130
so he'll listen to what you say.

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
When we go in,

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
take the initiative

92
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,450
and have a good talk with Liao Cong.

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,200
Come on, you're just using me.

94
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,440
Everyone has their own path.

95
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,720
I definitely can't change his mind.

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
How is this using you?

97
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,760
They asked for our help.

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,280
We're helping someone in need, understand?

99
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,720
That sounds nice,

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,760
but you're just being nosy.

101
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Why don't you believe me?

102
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,680
Let me out!

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
Liao Congwo, listen to me,

104
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,760
if you dare walk out that door today,

105
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,690
don't ever come back to this house.

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,960
Stop arguing.

107
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
The guests are already here.

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,960
Look at his attitude.

109
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,240
Just ignore him.

110
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Please come in.

111
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Come in, please.

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,760
Hello, sir and madam.

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
Hello.

114
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,560
Nian Nian, change your shoes.

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,840
No need to take off your shoes.

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,360
Let me tell you,

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,820
it doesn't matter who you've invited today.

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,720
It's fine.

119
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,640
Please, come in.

120
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Okay.

121
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,920
Have a seat.

122
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,040
Thanks.

123
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
You brought gifts too.

124
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,840
Yes.

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,740
This kid's got a stubborn temper.

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
It's alright.

127
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,760
My daughter is here today,

128
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,220
she'll sort it out for you.

129
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,720
That's kind of you. Thank you.

130
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Come, have a seat.

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Here, have some water.

132
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,280
Please sit down.

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,320
Don't be shy.

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,480
Here,

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
have some tea.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Auntie,

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,080
is Liao Cong in his room?

138
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,960
He's in his room,

139
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
playing video games.

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,080
Yes, he's gaming.

141
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
That's good,

142
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
I actually have some gaming questions

143
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,760
that I'd like to ask him about,

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,820
so I'll go find him.

145
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,700
Wait a moment, please.

146
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
Here, have some water,

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,960
drink up.

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm sorry about this,

149
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
no problem at all.

150
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,140
Liao Cong, someone's here to see you.

151
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,620
Thank you, Auntie.

152
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,920
Kids these days

153
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,980
are hard to handle.

154
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
Playing games?

155
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,080
Actually, once you go abroad,

156
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,159
there'll be so many new experiences,

157
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,720
you won't even have time to enjoy them all,

158
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,520
let alone have time for dating.

159
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,120
Besides,

160
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,680
being at different schools is actually good,

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
it gives you both some space,

162
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,040
being together all the time gets boring anyway.

163
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
And that counselor

164
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
already helped you get your acceptance letter,

165
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,920
I think that's good enough.

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,080
He's not a matchmaker,

167
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,159
he doesn't need to manage your love life too.

168
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,800
You really need to let this go,

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
it's not a big deal.

170
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
You don't know anything,

171
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,680
what gives you the right to lecture me?

172
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,040
You should have told me so I would know.

173
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,760
Not being in the same school

174
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,320
and being afraid of breaking up isn't shameful,

175
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
but blaming it on the teacher

176
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
is definitely your problem.

177
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,130
You've all been deceived by that Tang guy.

178
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,080
At first, my family

179
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
went to him because of his reputation.

180
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
But when we asked around,

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,960
his price was several times more expensive than others.

182
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Fine, we paid for peace of mind.

183
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,480
But in all my life,

184
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,800
I've never seen such a negligent teacher.

185
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
If you try to schedule him ten times,

186
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,400
you're lucky to get one appointment.

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,880
And when you finally get an appointment,

188
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,740
he cuts the lesson time on his own.

189
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,620
Everything he teaches is already in the materials.

190
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,000
He's really carefree.

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,130
Just read it as it is.

192
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,360
If that's the case,

193
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,880
why don't you tell your parents?

194
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
You think I haven't?

195
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
It's useless.

196
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,720
They just believe in that fraud's reputation.

197
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,480
When I said I wanted to change teachers,

198
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,680
they thought I was making trouble.

199
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,400
I see.

200
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,320
If what you're saying is true,

201
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,130
then why would this Mr. Tang

202
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,280
become a star teacher?

203
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
He has a high success rate

204
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,560
simply because he goes for quantity, not quality.

205
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,400
My girlfriend and I both wanted to study film.

206
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,840
But the admission score for South Canada University is indeed quite high.

207
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,960
It was the first time I studied so hard

208
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,760
and in the last few tests,

209
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,400
my scores were already above the application threshold.

210
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,560
But this fraud

211
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,760
lied to me about having inside information.

212
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,800
He said South Canada University had raised their admission requirements

213
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
and with my grades, I had no chance.

214
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,840
Inside information?

215
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
All universities are completely transparent

216
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
about this kind of information.

217
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,840
Any updates

218
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
would be published on the school's official website,

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,480
so there's no such thing as inside information.

220
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,040
How would I have known that back then?

221
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,500
I was completely stunned.

222
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Now he's introducing me to this other university

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
and praising it to high heaven,

224
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,720
saying this school's

225
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,400
film program will soon surpass South Canada University.

226
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,930
But when the admission scores were released,

227
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
South Canada University hadn't raised their requirements at all.

228
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,640
I could have successfully applied there.

229
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,040
If all your hard work was wasted like this,

230
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,370
could you just let it go?

231
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Professor Zhuo

232
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
I have something to ask you.

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
It's like this,

234
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,040
my dad's friend's child

235
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,000
just got an acceptance letter from an American university,

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,280
but he thinks the counselor scammed him.

237
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,360
Slow down, slow down.

238
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,280
Wait,

239
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
isn't it nighttime in America right now?

240
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I'm really sorry

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,250
for calling you so late.

242
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,520
I'm in Beijing.

243
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
What?

244
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier you're in Beijing?

245
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
I could have picked you up!

246
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,360
It's fine,

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,890
I was planning to tell you after I got settled.

248
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Alright then, I'll come see you,

249
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,320
anyway, this matter

250
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
can't be explained in just a few words over the phone,

251
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
let's talk in person.

252
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,640
Then send me the address

253
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,840
and time to my phone later.

254
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,280
Okay,

255
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,640
bye-

256
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,240
bye.

257
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,440
Teacher Zhuo has come to Beijing.

258
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,040
Nian Nian,

259
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
how did your talk with him go?

260
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
Were you able to help him?

261
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,720
Not at all.

262
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
That's understandable.

263
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,400
Our Nian Nian has never been in a relationship,

264
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,960
so how could she possibly counsel someone else?

265
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,840
It's not even a relationship problem to begin with.

266
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,560
Then why is this kid acting crazy?

267
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,000
I heard it has something to do with his tutor,

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,530
but we can't just take Liao Cong's word for it.

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,240
I need to ask Teacher Zhuo myself.

270
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,700
By the way, Teacher Zhuo has come to Beijing.

271
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,720
He's here!

272
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
That's great!

273
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,600
You know, when your mom and I went to America

274
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,680
we were completely clueless.

275
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,400
We were so lucky Professor Zhuo helped us.

276
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
We should show our appreciation

277
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
and be good hosts.

278
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,640
Right, we should treat him to dinner.

279
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
How about roast duck?

280
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,720
Go make a reservation at the restaurant.

281
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Okay.

282
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,040
It's like this,

283
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,920
Professor Zhuo just landed

284
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,200
and doesn't know what's going on yet.

285
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,280
I'll go ask about Liao Cong's situation first,

286
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,800
and we'll keep in touch by phone.

287
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm going now.

288
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,440
Bye, okay.

289
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,120
Okay.

290
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
Where are you going?

291
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm going to see Gu Nian.

292
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,640
Wait, I'll get my coat.

293
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
She needs to see me about something,

294
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,280
not for fun.

295
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,200
I never said it was for fun.

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,560
Your mom will get angry again if she can't find you.

297
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,240
Oh my god!

298
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,560
A woman in menopause

299
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,120
will explode anytime even if I don't provoke her.

300
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,580
I'll just leave her a note.

301
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,880
Betty, it's your first day in Beijing,

302
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,720
can't you behave yourself?

303
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,650
Why don't you want me to go with you?

304
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,480
Do you and Gu Nian

305
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,280
have some secret you can't tell?

306
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,840
Fine, whatever.

307
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Okay, wait for me here.

308
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,720
Did that boy really say that?

309
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,920
I didn't exaggerate at all.

310
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
But what's the benefit

311
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,400
for that teacher to do this?

312
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,200
But then again, this boy has no reason to lie.

313
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,080
It can't be helped.

314
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,240
Behind study abroad agencies

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,800
there are some unspoken rules.

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Of course, I've only heard one side of the story,

317
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,260
so it's hard to say.

318
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,280
Why don't we arrange to talk with Liao Cong again?

319
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,560
This is so annoying.

320
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,600
I've spent the whole afternoon listening to this nonsense,

321
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
and what difference does it make anyway?

322
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,400
I told you

323
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
not to follow me here.

324
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,840
I regret it, okay?

325
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,120
Alright, let's change the subject.

326
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,720
Exactly.

327
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,800
I finally made it to Beijing

328
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,200
and I'm bored to death staying in the hotel.

329
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,420
Zhuopeng, you need to take me out.

330
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Leave it to me.

331
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,600
Since you're in Beijing,

332
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
I should be a good host

333
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,680
and show you around the city properly.

334
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,400
Gunian, there's really no need to go to all that trouble.

335
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,520
I appreciate your good intentions

336
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,160
but this isn't a hassle at all.

337
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,000
No problem, I'll take care of everything,

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,730
don't worry.

339
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Thank you.

340
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,640
By the way.

341
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
I don't really like rushed arrangements,

342
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,690
I prefer things to be more relaxed.

343
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,960
We don't need to hurry back in the evening.

344
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,480
Actually.

345
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,160
We could find a place

346
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,640
with a nice view to stay at,

347
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,240
and then I can enjoy a hot bath.

348
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I'll arrange everything properly.

349
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Good.

350
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,040
So tomorrow?

351
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
Tomorrow won't work.

352
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,200
Why not?

353
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,060
Tomorrow really doesn't work. I'm meeting my aunt.

354
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Zhuopeng,

355
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,840
are these gifts enough?

356
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,240
We don't want to seem insincere.

357
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
It's enough, Dad.

358
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,120
Aunt isn't materialistic.

359
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,780
It's the thought that counts.

360
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,400
No.

361
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,680
I think I should buy some flowers too,

362
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,240
that would be better.

363
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,160
Dad, come back.

364
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,890
Really, don't overthink this.

365
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,960
Making it too formal

366
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,680
will only make her uncomfortable.

367
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,200
Really?

368
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,880
Really.

369
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,400
Alright then, let's just bite the bullet.

370
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
Relax a bit, Dad.

371
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,720
It's not like we're going to war.

372
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,000
For me, it's pretty much the same as going to war.

373
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,290
It is difficult.

374
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,160
To be honest,

375
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
I didn't expect you'd agree to come with me.

376
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,080
What finally made you change your mind?

377
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,360
It's been too long,

378
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,260
I actually want to see her.

379
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,360
Let's go.

380
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,760
Coming, coming!

381
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm here.

382
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,810
Zhuopeng, you're here!

383
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Finally got you back home.

384
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,040
Auntie.

385
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,000
Come in quickly.

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,360
Zhuangzhuang, you've grown so tall.

387
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,720
Let me help you.

388
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,200
Come in. Take this.

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Just a small gift.

390
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,320
How have you been?

391
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,160
I'm good.

392
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,920
Xiaomin.

393
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
Why are you here?

394
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,640
You're not welcome in our You family.

395
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,320
Get out!

396
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,140
Auntie, please calm down,

397
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,320
it was my idea,

398
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,680
Dad and I came today

399
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,480
to discuss with you

400
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
about visiting Mom's grave.

401
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,760
What right does he have to discuss anything with us?

402
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,120
Let's talk this through calmly,

403
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,240
why don't we sit down and chat?

404
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
Don't you get involved in this,

405
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I'm the one who decides.

406
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120
Get out! Out!

407
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,000
Auntie.

408
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,160
Xiaopeng.

409
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,280
Xiaomin, it's been 20 years,

410
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,120
some things

411
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,960
should be left in the past.

412
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,240
The grudges between us adults,

413
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
I think it's better if we resolve them.

414
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,120
You say it so casually,

415
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,320
as if we can just let it go, is that it?

416
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,700
Let me tell you,

417
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,640
this will never be over for me.

418
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
There's nothing to resolve between us,

419
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,120
and no possibility of reconciliation.

420
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,920
Get out!

421
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Please calm down.

422
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,240
Say another word and you'll be out too!

423
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,770
All of you Zhuos can get out!

424
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,520
Get out

425
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,280
of here! Get lost!

426
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
Go! All of you get out!

427
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,040
Mom, what's wrong?

428
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Why are you acting like this?

429
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Stay out of adult business.

430
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,120
Yes, it's adult business,

431
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,640
but it has nothing to do with Zhuopeng,

432
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,240
he didn't do anything wrong.

433
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,840
I think you're being unreasonable.

434
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,440
The problem is that he brought his father here.

435
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,520
Then why not just ask Uncle to leave?

436
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,760
You've been looking forward to seeing Zhuopeng for so long,

437
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,680
and you kicked him out as soon as he arrived.

438
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,940
He didn't even get to eat any of this food.

439
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,040
Then hurry up and call Zhuopeng back!

440
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,720
On it.

441
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,599
Dad, don't just leave like this.

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,880
Why don't you go back?

443
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,810
Don't make your aunt angry.

444
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
Let's go back together.

445
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,839
I'll talk to her again.

446
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,359
Come on.

447
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,920
No need.

448
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,980
Her thinking this way,

449
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,480
I've expected it all along.

450
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,160
Some things

451
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
are hard to explain clearly.

452
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,200
Dad, are you okay?

453
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
What could be wrong with me?

454
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm fine.

455
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,540
Uncle, Brother Zhuopeng,

456
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
wait a second.

457
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,480
Uncle, my mom's just like that,

458
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,680
like a ticking bomb,

459
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,140
she's like this every day.

460
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,320
I get scolded plenty at home too.

461
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,200
Please don't take it personally.

462
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
It's okay, Zhuangzhuang.

463
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,730
I understand your mother's personality.

464
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,500
Brother Zhuopeng,

465
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
my mom yelling at you was just collateral damage.

466
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,320
She's feeling guilty about it at home right now.

467
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
There's a whole table of good food with no one to eat it.

468
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,090
After driving you away,

469
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
it's such a waste.

470
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
Uncle, Brother Zhuopeng, please come up for dinner.

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,640
It's alright, no need.

472
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,770
You go ahead and eat.

473
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
I'll just walk around by myself for a bit.

474
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,330
It's fine, you two go ahead.

475
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
Go on now, hurry back.

476
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
Forget it, I'll stay with my dad.

477
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,200
Don't worry,

478
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm not in a rush to leave Beijing.

479
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll come for dinner another time,

480
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,760
please apologize to your mom for me.

481
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
But if I don't drag you upstairs,

482
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,420
my mom will scold me again.

483
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Oh, by the way, Zhuopeng,

484
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,760
I have something else to tell you.

485
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,360
What is it?

486
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,140
Are you free tomorrow?

487
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,560
I can take you out for some fun.

488
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,520
Winter in Beijing is perfect for hot springs,

489
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,780
it's really relaxing.

490
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
I've been planning this for a long time,

491
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,480
just waiting for you to come back to Beijing.

492
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,320
Hot springs?

493
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,640
Sure, can I invite two more people?

494
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,440
No problem,

495
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,800
the more the merrier.

496
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
Don't worry,

497
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,240
I'll take care of everything perfectly.

498
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

499
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Bye.

500
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,920
Didn't you say you wanted to be a good host?

501
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,680
My cousin just said the same thing,

502
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,210
why don't we all go together

503
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,580
to the hot springs?

504
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Great! Let's meet at 8 AM tomorrow

505
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,000
in the hotel lobby.

506
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,880
Don't be late! Bye.

507
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
Mom, open the door.

508
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,490
I was wondering if you had any legs.

509
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,920
Coming!

510
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Sorry to disturb you.

511
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,680
What brings you here, Zhuopeng?

512
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,520
Is Betty here?

513
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
Yes, she is. Come in.

514
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,400
No, that's not...

515
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Betty! Zhuopeng is here.

516
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,480
It's nothing important.

517
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
Don't come in! Don't come in!

518
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,840
Let me get you some water.

519
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,280
No need, I'll leave after I finish talking.

520
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,440
So, tomorrow my cousin

521
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,640
has arranged for us to go to a hot spring.

522
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm wondering if Betty would be interested in going.

523
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,640
Gu Nian is coming too.

524
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,120
I'm sure she'd love to go.

525
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,600
Great.

526
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Besides, it's good for her to go

527
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
so she won't be upset with me.

528
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
Why don't you come along too?

529
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
You young people should just enjoy yourselves,

530
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
what would I do there?

531
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
Just take good care of Betty.

532
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,570
Absolutely.

533
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
What are you two talking about?

534
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,640
I'll be right out.

535
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,320
Zhuo Peng invited you to the hot springs.

536
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,520
That's great!

537
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,680
Yes, absolutely!

538
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,760
Alright, I'll head out first.

539
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,640
Please remind her

540
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,480
tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock

541
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,920
to meet in the hotel lobby.

542
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,320
Okay.

543
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
Alright, good night.

544
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,480
Where is he?

545
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
Meet at the lobby at 8 tomorrow.

546
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,660
What about you?

547
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,560
Don't worry, I'm not going.

548
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,320
What are you looking for?

549
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,640
My swimsuit.

550
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,090
Aren't we going to the hot springs?

551
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,560
Where are we going now?

552
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,600
The natural scenery around the hot springs is beautiful too,

553
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,000
so Zhuopeng and I discussed it,

554
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
we'll spend the day exploring nearby,

555
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
and when we get hungry,

556
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,680
we'll find a countryside restaurant to eat.

557
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,560
Fine, I don't care where we go,

558
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm only interested in the evening anyway.

559
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,920
Listen,

560
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,600
your mother is his mother's sister.

561
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,240
You two must be quite close.

562
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
But I've noticed

563
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,240
you brothers don't look alike at all.

564
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,460
My mom says the same thing.

565
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,880
You seem

566
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,240
more straightforward and approachable.

567
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,320
Wait, what do you mean by that?

568
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,200
Are you saying I'm difficult to get along with?

569
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,720
You're more mysterious and hard to figure out.

570
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,840
How charming.

571
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,980
That's what makes it mysterious.

572
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,940
At the end of the day, I just don't have many principles.

573
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,920
I wish I could be more like Zhuopeng.

574
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,780
You can't just learn Zhuopeng's kind of character.

575
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,640
You're fine just being yourself.

576
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,640
My mom always says Zhuopeng is like my aunt,

577
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,600
knowing exactly what he wants and doesn't want,

578
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
and he's super smart too.

579
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,000
If I were half as smart as my brother,

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,520
studying abroad wouldn't be such a struggle for me.

581
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,980
Zhuangzhuang, you want to study abroad too?

582
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,840
It's not future tense, it's present continuous.

583
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm already getting tutoring.

584
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,600
Gu Nian, Zhuopeng,

585
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,080
can you two tell me what studying abroad feels like?

586
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Is it really free and unrestricted?

587
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,360
College isn't as simple as you think.

588
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,960
The coursework is incredibly demanding,

589
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
and I'm completely overwhelmed right now.

590
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,480
She's right.

591
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,400
Studying abroad isn't paradise,

592
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
if you actually go there,

593
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,060
you might think it's hell.

594
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,840
Stop scaring him.

595
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,920
Don't worry, Zhuangzhuang.

596
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,780
Just stay calm,

597
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,220
and ask me anytime if you have questions.

598
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,340
Thanks, Zhuopeng.

599
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,200
I can't stand this mess.

600
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,490
Being a mother means working like a horse.

601
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,480
Three moves to win over Zhuopeng.

602
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,680
Zhuopeng.

603
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,240
Zhuopeng.

604
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,720
Who is it?

605
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,000
What's the rush about?

606
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,730
What's this?

607
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,560
Oh my god!

608
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,460
How could you read the child's diary?

609
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,800
Let me ask you something,

610
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,460
and you must answer honestly.

611
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,250
When have I ever lied to you?

612
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,380
I'm asking you,

613
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,080
did Betty come to Beijing because of Zhuopeng?

614
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,620
You're stepping on me.

615
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,320
So she went to Portland for Zhuopeng too?

616
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
I guess so.

617
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,080
How could you not tell me?

618
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,120
Well...

619
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,680
Liar! Liar! Liar!

620
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,360
Stop hitting!

621
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
You liar!

622
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
Alright, alright, stop!

623
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,140
That hurts!

624
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,080
She's just a young girl,

625
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,520
isn't it normal that she's experiencing first love?

626
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,680
What's the big deal?

627
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,960
Easy for you to say.

628
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,400
I think

629
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,640
our Betty has been seduced by Zhuopeng.

630
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Isn't it serious enough that she ran off to Portland alone?

631
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,140
And now she's come to Beijing.

632
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,240
I bet

633
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,040
if Zhuopeng sells Betty out,

634
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,000
she'll be counting money for him like a fool.

635
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
How is that possible?

636
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,480
You're making things up.

637
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,840
It makes me angry just thinking about it.

638
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,680
You two are emotional frauds.

639
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,400
Fine,

640
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,880
deceiving both mother and daughter.

641
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,800
That's enough,

642
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
enough already. Will you ever stop?

643
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,920
Oh no!

644
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,880
What's wrong?

645
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,600
They're going to a hot spring together.

646
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,120
Yes, what's the problem?

647
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,040
Let me ask you,

648
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,160
is your son easily tempted?

649
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,210
What are you talking about?

650
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,000
Tell me.

651
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,960
Where is your mind going?

652
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I know my son well enough.

653
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,080
He won't be interested in young girls,

654
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,720
he's a complete gentleman.

655
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,800
Think about it,

656
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,040
I'd believe he could resist anyone else,

657
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,920
but we're talking about Betty here.

658
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,960
What about Betty?

659
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,640
Betty brought sexy pajamas.

660
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,700
Betty is so cute and looks so much like me,

661
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
wearing sexy pajamas,

662
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,620
can Zhuopeng resist that?

663
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,340
What are you thinking?

664
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,440
What am I thinking?

665
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,360
Look, seriously.

666
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,040
I swear on my honor as a father,

667
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,320
Zhuopeng would never cheat.

668
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,440
No, no, he absolutely wouldn't

669
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,920
cross the line.

670
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,920
Gu Nian,

671
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,480
here are the room cards for you and Betty.

672
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,840
Zhuo Peng and I are staying over there.

673
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,320
You two should go rest first,

674
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
and once we're all settled in,

675
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,000
we'll go to the hot springs.

676
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,530
Please stop talking, okay?

677
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
Let's go to our room first.

678
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,080
See you later.

679
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,320
Are you kidding me?

680
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,360
Is that your grandmother's swimsuit?

681
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,640
It's so ugly!

682
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
I-I think it looks fine.

683
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,170
Your turn now. Hurry up.

684
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,400
When I come out, don't be jealous.

685
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,600
Just wait.

686
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
I think it looks pretty good.

687
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,000
Betty, can you hurry up?

688
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
Just a minute.

689
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,440
Nobody's rushing us.

690
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,080
I'm telling you, there's a call for you.

691
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
Teacher Zhuo.

692
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,640
What are you doing?

693
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,400
What do you mean?

694
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,060
Why did you change back again?

695
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,280
So what if your swimsuit is a bit ugly?

696
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,810
It's not like anyone's looking at you anyway.

697
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,320
Teacher Zhuo called and said something came up.

698
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,640
We need to get back right away.

699
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,000
Hurry up and change back into your clothes.

700
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,930
I'll wait for you downstairs. Bye!

701
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,760
What?

702
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,120
Are you kidding me?

703
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,720
Are you guys messing with me?

704
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
I'm sorry, Betty.

705
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
I just got a call

706
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,450
from my study abroad tutor,

707
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,680
asking me to attend class at 11 tonight.

708
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,480
Does the class

709
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,690
really need to be so urgent?

710
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,600
It is quite late,

711
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,280
and everyone would be exhausted

712
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,720
if we have to travel back now.

713
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,800
Yeah, Zhuangzhuang,

714
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,640
couldn't you talk to your tutor

715
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,840
about rescheduling?

716
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,600
I know this is unreasonable.

717
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,940
You don't understand,

718
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,020
he's a top-rated tutor in this field,

719
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,000
and it's usually very hard to book him.

720
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,080
If I miss this one,

721
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,760
scheduling the next session

722
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,080
won't be so easy.

723
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,960
Then you can go back by yourself,

724
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,690
and the three of us can stick to our original plan.

725
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
He doesn't have a driver's license,

726
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,680
and few drivers would be willing to go back to the city at this hour.

727
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,320
Let's go,

728
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,200
come on.

729
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,320
Alright, let's go.

730
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,400
Hey, Jessica.

731
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,440
Zhuopeng, you finally answered your phone.

732
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
Where on earth are you guys?

733
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,680
I've been calling all day with no answer.

734
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,740
Sorry, the signal might be poor here.

735
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,920
Zhuopeng,

736
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,000
are you guys already enjoying the hot springs?

737
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,160
Not yet,

738
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,960
we had some issues and we're heading back now.

739
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,820
It's canceled?

740
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,210
Alright, I understand.

741
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay, come back safely.

742
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,040
Drive carefully and stay safe.

743
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,520
We will, don't worry.

744
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,210
What was that about?

745
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,800
Jessica was asking where we are.

746
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,280
What a coincidence.

747
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,640
Are you sure?

748
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,920
I'm sure,

749
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,360
it's that scammer Liao mentioned.

750
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,000
What should we do now?

751
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Let's observe a bit more.

752
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,120
Don't you think,

753
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,960
meeting for lessons at this kind of skewer place so late,

754
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,490
can they even hear clearly?

755
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,280
No, I need to hear what they're saying.

756
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,440
Don't waste your energy,

757
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,900
you can't hear anything with all this noise.

758
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,100
Look, Zhuangzhuang's expression doesn't seem right.

759
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,160
Let's go.

760
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,760
What?

761
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,920
We're leaving already?

762
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
Let's go check it out.

763
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,080
Zhuangzhuang, what's wrong?

764
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,680
I saw your teacher left.

765
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,760
Cousin,

766
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,100
I probably won't get into a good university.

767
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,760
Why would you say that?

768
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,560
There's still some time before the exam.

769
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,600
That's right, this is the final sprint,

770
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,800
you can't jump to conclusions so early.

771
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
But the teacher said with my scores,

772
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,170
there's no point in aiming higher,

773
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,640
it's safer to choose some ordinary universities,

774
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,840
and those good universities

775
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,180
apparently have many drawbacks too.

776
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,240
Tell me,

777
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,100
what was your score on the last TOEFL practice test?

778
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,960
It was 91 last time.

779
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,360
That's not bad at all.

780
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,090
That's already above average.

781
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,200
Although you might not get into top universities,

782
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,730
if you push a little harder,

783
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,760
you actually have a chance at a top 50 university.

784
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,720
But, but the teacher said,

785
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,200
I should just give up.

786
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,760
Zhuangzhuang, call your teacher right now,

787
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,360
and schedule another lesson.

788
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,280
How can I do that?

789
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,740
The teacher will be angry,

790
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
I definitely won't get an appointment.

791
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,160
I don't care, you must get one,

792
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,610
and this time Gu Nian and I will go with you.

793
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,000
Listen to me.

794
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,640
Dad, I'm back.

795
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Hello, Zhuopeng.

796
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,280
Jessica, you're looking for my dad?

797
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,409
I'm looking for you. Let's have a chat.

798
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Jingying is here.

799
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,239
You, get out.

800
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,600
At this hour?

801
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,000
Where am I supposed to go?

802
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This hotel is huge,

803
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,659
just find somewhere else to hang out for a while.

804
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,520
With my charm

805
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,679
aren't you afraid that if I go out now

806
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,480
some girl might fall for me?

807
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,000
Go ahead, just go.

808
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,199
So...

809
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,159
Okay.

810
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,660
Zhuo Peng, I'm going to ask you something

811
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,440
and you must answer honestly

812
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,200
without a single lie.

813
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,530
Of course, absolutely.

814
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,960
Betty likes you

815
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
did you know that?

816
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
Yes, I did.

817
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,040
I just asked her to stay at your place for a few days,

818
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,160
how did it turn into this?

819
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
No, it's like this with Jessica.

820
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,280
Actually, the first time Betty met me,

821
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,560
she asked for my phone number.

822
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,760
Of course I refused.

823
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,160
So when you all asked her to stay at my place later,

824
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,220
I wasn't really comfortable with it.

825
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,000
Why didn't you say something then?

826
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Given the situation at that time,

827
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,620
I figured it wouldn't have made any difference.

828
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,100
Alright then, let's drop this topic.

829
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,120
I just want to tell you that

830
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm not a dictatorial mother.

831
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,560
Yes, I don't want Betty to date too early,

832
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
and I worry about her getting hurt.

833
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,920
But if you two truly have feelings for each other,

834
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,840
if you're really right for each other,

835
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
I would give you my blessing.

836
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,760
So as a mother,

837
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
I need to know

838
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,400
if you really like Betty?

839
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I really don't.

840
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,720
Really?

841
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,800
Jessica is still a child,

842
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,600
in my eyes she's just a kid,

843
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,130
she's like a little sister.

844
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,360
And even if,

845
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,080
hypothetically speaking, she were a mature woman,

846
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,760
she's not my type.

847
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,120
If you're still worried,

848
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,740
I can easily speak to Betty

849
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,520
and clear things up in front of you.

850
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,650
No, no, no. We can't handle it that way.

851
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,410
I need to figure something out.

852
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,120
Betty, this child,

853
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,540
although she seems carefree on the surface,

854
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,660
is actually very fragile inside.

855
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
Because of the relationship between me and her father,

856
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,300
she finds it hard to trust others.

857
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,520
If you reject her,

858
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,120
yes, her hopes would be cut off,

859
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,320
but I'm afraid she might not be able to cope

860
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,400
and do something foolish,

861
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
which would be terrible.

862
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,680
I understand.

863
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,520
Besides,

864
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,360
if this isn't handled properly,

865
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,800
when you two become step-siblings in the future,

866
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,520
wouldn't that be awkward, right?

867
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,200
Right.

868
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,760
Okay, meeting adjourned.

869
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,440
Oh, Mom.

870
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,480
You look so tired,

871
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,600
are you about to go to bed?

872
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Why are you calling at this hour?

873
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,360
I miss you.

874
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,720
We're about to go to bed.

875
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,880
Mom, is your shoulder still hurting?

876
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,040
Is that herbal patch I bought you working well?

877
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
It works quite well,

878
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,960
the pain is almost gone now.

879
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,160
Should I send you some more?

880
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,680
No need,

881
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,320
international shipping is too much trouble.

882
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,200
Then I'll just bring some back with me next time I visit.

883
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,360
Are you kidding me?

884
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,000
Aren't you working anymore?

885
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,530
Why come back for no reason,

886
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,480
wasting money on plane tickets?

887
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,120
Mom, you've changed.

888
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,220
You used to be eager to pay for my ticket to come home.

889
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,560
Mom,

890
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,360
what's wrong?

891
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,540
I've been busy with our family business lately,

892
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,100
your father and I are planning to go on a trip,

893
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,240
and there'd be no one to take care of you if you came back.

894
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
Where are you guys going?

895
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,120
We're going to your uncle's place.

896
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,520
Isn't Uncle in Hainan?

897
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,840
Yes,

898
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,760
we're going to Hainan.

899
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,010
Why are you visiting Uncle?

900
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,800
Haven't seen him for a while, just going for a visit.

901
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
Don't ask so many questions.

902
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,240
Mom,

903
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,720
I've been in touch with Dahua recently,

904
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,180
my high school classmate.

905
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
Doesn't he run a construction company back home?

906
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,440
He wants me to join him.

907
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,600
I've been thinking,

908
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,600
the domestic market is good now,

909
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,720
so maybe,

910
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,640
maybe after I get my degree,

911
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I could try developing my career back home.

912
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,240
That Dahua never tells the truth,

913
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,960
he's just a big talker.

914
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,900
Why come back when you have a good job in America?

915
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,840
Well, then,

916
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,400
I could go back to inherit the family business.

917
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,700
Why do you keep talking about coming back today?

918
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,240
You're not having problems in America, are you?

919
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,520
No,

920
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
it's just that over these years,

921
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,280
I've spent too little time with you both.

922
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,040
Besides, if something's happening at home,

923
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,960
you don't tell me about it.

924
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,760
Shouldn't I come back and check?

925
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,640
What good would telling you do?

926
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,240
I could help share your burdens,

927
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,640
discuss things with you.

928
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,120
Mom,

929
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,520
has something happened at home?

930
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Please don't hide anything from me.

931
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
It's nothing.

932
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,960
You know, in business,

933
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,160
there are times when cash flow gets tight.

934
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
If we ask your uncle,

935
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,600
we should be able to get through this.

936
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Well, how about this,

937
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,320
wait until I come back to China,

938
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,360
we'll go see my uncle together.

939
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,640
I haven't seen him in ages.

940
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,360
No, no,

941
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,770
you just focus on your work in America.

942
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
Don't worry about family matters here.

943
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,880
Alright, alright,

944
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,040
okay, calm down,

945
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,240
what's the big deal?

946
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,840
Fine, I won't come back then.

947
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
You're our family's only hope.

948
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,930
Just focus on your work over there,

949
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,520
we can handle our problems ourselves.

950
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Okay, got it.

951
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,600
Go to sleep now,

952
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,960
son. Bye-bye.

953
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,280
Hello, Uncle.

954
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
It's me, Guo Yang.

955
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,240
Did your mother ask you to call me?

956
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,320
No,

957
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,040
but didn't my mom say she's coming to see you in a few days?

958
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,720
It's been a long time since I called you,

959
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,760
just wanted to check in

960
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,820
and see how you've been doing lately.

961
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,560
I've already helped with everything I can,

962
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,200
but the mess your family is in

963
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,080
isn't something I alone can fix.

964
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,760
Wait, Uncle, what do you mean by that?

965
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,900
It's my dad's business that's in trouble, isn't it?

966
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,720
At a time like this,

967
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
what's the point of keeping secrets anymore?

968
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,600
Anyway,

969
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,680
there's nothing I can do about your family's problems.

970
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,360
Tell your parents

971
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,280
not to come looking for us.

972
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,640
Our whole family won't be home,

973
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,080
so it would be a waste of their time.

974
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,940
Uncle, how can you talk like that?

975
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Honey, why aren't you in bed yet?

976
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,680
What's wrong?

977
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,520
Something must have happened at home.

978
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,780
I just called my uncle,

979
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,400
he said he didn't know my mom was going to see him,

980
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,840
and that he couldn't help with whatever's happening in my family.

981
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,170
Have you asked your mom?

982
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,240
I talked to her,

983
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
but she won't tell me what's really going on.

984
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,530
Something's wrong.

985
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,840
What should we do?
