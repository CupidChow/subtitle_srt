1
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,009
Zheng Xiangdong is waiting for my update.

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
Things aren't as simple as he thinks.

3
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
Isn't the company's legal representative your ex-boyfriend, Lin Yao?

4
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,759
Figure something out.

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,160
If you miss this chance, it'll be hard to get back on your feet.

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,120
I get it, you don't need to say more.

7
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,840
Thank you, Xilin.

8
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
Let me think about it.

9
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,680
I'll wait for your response.

10
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
What a headache.

11
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,050
None of us knows how to deal with Betty,

12
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,650
we're all at a loss with her.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
I actually think that Betty

14
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,560
has quite a strong artistic sense.

15
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
I like the sound of that.

16
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,920
It's good that Betty has a hobby,

17
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
we should support her.

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,079
Hey Sam,

19
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
old friend, I'm back.

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,760
I never thought that my college hobby

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
would become my career.

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,960
Nice.

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,530
How's business at your studio?

24
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
Not bad.

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,720
I haven't had the chance to make a feature film yet,

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,400
so

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm just doing some small video projects for now.

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
I saw you were looking for actors on social media.

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,640
Yeah,

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
it's for a Chinese girl

31
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,640
who wants to make a promotional video.

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,320
Is it for the student council election?

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,840
Including you,

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,560
I've already helped two Chinese-American girls

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,820
with their campaigns.

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,050
I've always had high hopes for you.

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,079
From your early digital shorts to film projects.

38
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,940
Next would be big-budget commercial films, right?

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
To be honest, just having enough funding

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,560
to make an independent film is a blessing,

41
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,490
I can't even think beyond that yet.

42
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,220
How's your casting going?

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
Almost done,

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,280
we're about to start shooting soon.

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,010
I was actually going to recommend an actor to you.

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,880
Great.

47
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
Who is it?

48
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,600
A Chinese American,

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
a 16-year-old girl.

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,000
A Chinese American

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
16-year-old girl.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,760
If we could let the little girl have a taste of acting,

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,959
I can sponsor a bit.

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,959
How much can you sponsor?

55
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,760
5,000.

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,400
5,000? You live in the heart of New York.

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,920
5,000?

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you kidding me?

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,200
Fine, 10,000.

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,760
But she must have lines,

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,120
and there must be close-ups of her face.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
Deal!

63
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,680
Cheers!

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,960
Thank you.

65
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,560
Hello.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,240
Welcome.

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,960
I can be in a movie now!

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,040
It's not a movie,

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,520
it's a digital short film.

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,840
The director is my friend,

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,040
they're recruiting actors now,

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,400
so I got you an audition.

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,880
Oh my god, thank you!

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,120
I love you!

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
Come with me, I'll show you the script.

76
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay.

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
Whatever you like.

78
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
Alright.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,200
Let's go,

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,960
this way.

81
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,480
Which character am I playing?

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,520
You'll play a high school student from China,

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,450
all your lines are already marked.

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Such a long script,

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,960
and I only have this few lines?

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,280
Betty, even a role like this

87
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,760
I had to fight hard with my friend to get it for you.

88
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,880
Thanks.

89
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,600
I'll be straightforward with you,

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
letting you play this role comes with conditions.

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,280
I knew it.

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Let Chen Yingxi stay at your place.

93
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,880
What's that got to do with you?

94
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,120
If that's the condition,

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
I won't do it.

96
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,960
This could be your weapon.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
What?

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,000
When your mom criticizes you again,

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
just throw this DVD at her,

100
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,960
show her that professionals recognize your talent,

101
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,160
and shut her up as she's just an amateur.

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,840
Do a good job.

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,040
When filming wraps,

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,360
I'll get you a Sennheiser,

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,480
and pick out a nice guitar for you.

106
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,960
Alright, deal.

107
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
Good,

108
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,540
then study the script carefully.

109
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,760
Betty agreed to the exchange student program.

110
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,480
Really?

111
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,600
I told you to find the right approach.

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,730
Young girls are easy to get along with.

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,130
So that's why you got her that acting role.

114
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
Kids these days aren't easily persuaded.

115
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
It's simpler to make deals with them.

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,760
How did you get her this role?

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,840
Do you remember

118
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,900
that guy Sam who filmed for me before?

119
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,820
Is he still making movies?

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
That shabby film crew of his,

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
everyone basically works for free,

122
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
only enthusiasts like Betty would want to join.

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
So,

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
good deal, right?

125
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,300
You must have paid something, right?

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
Not much. Just 10,000.

127
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,840
You would have done the same thing.

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,300
You didn't have to do this.

129
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
I just wanted to help you.

130
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,720
By the way,

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
want to go watch Betty filming in a few days?

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Why would I go?

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,659
To see how this little girl's acting skills are.

134
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,010
She might become your sister someday.

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Alright then.

136
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
I need to tell you something.

137
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Chen Yingxi's situation has been resolved,

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,520
Betty agreed to let her move in.

139
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,960
That's impossible.

140
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
Stop joking around.

141
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,560
Do I look like I'm joking?

142
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
Yes.

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,520
You won't even look at me,

144
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,580
how would you know?

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,680
Fine.

146
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
So how did you convince Betty?

147
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
It wasn't me. It was Lin Yao.

148
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,370
Doesn't Betty have dreams of becoming a star?

149
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,000
Lin Yao arranged an acting opportunity for her,

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
with that as the condition for letting Chen Yingxi move in.

151
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,200
Betty agreed right away.

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,640
What's wrong?

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,120
Everything's resolved but you don't seem that happy.

154
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,280
Lin Yao is quite thoughtful.

155
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,760
Morning.

156
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,560
Luo Yan.

157
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,720
How are you doing?

158
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm perfectly fine.

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,400
Professor Wu published a new paper.

160
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,600
I remember you did all the related experiments,

161
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,130
so why isn't your name on it?

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,240
Let me see.

163
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,040
Where is it?

164
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,920
At the back.

165
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,520
[Nelson-Wu Model]

166
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
How is that possible?

167
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
Luo Yan

168
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,380
What kind of garbage conclusion is this?

169
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,640
I... I spent over 500 hours on experiments

170
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,760
and this is the conclusion I reached.

171
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,480
The characteristic curves of your latest storage device

172
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
under accelerated softening conditions

173
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
don't match

174
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,240
my Niels-Wu model at all.

175
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,800
Go back and check carefully

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,720
review your experimental conditions

177
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,380
and data processing methods.

178
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Something must be wrong somewhere.

179
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
Professor Wu,

180
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,920
your Niels-Wu model was developed

181
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,320
based on technology from 10 years ago

182
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
and the technological capabilities

183
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,600
and storage device dimensions available at that time.

184
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,560
It was derived from observations under those conditions.

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
But today's new storage devices

186
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
have reached nanometer scale,

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
and this has triggered

188
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
many new physical mechanisms.

189
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,760
It's perfectly normal that the Niels model

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,160
can't explain these phenomena.

191
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,400
Are you suggesting

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,040
that my Niels-Wu model is wrong?

193
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm saying...

194
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
Society evolves, science advances

195
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,600
Society evolves, technology advances,

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,160
but truth remains eternal.

197
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,420
Take it back and fix it.

198
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
How am I supposed to fix this?

199
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,600
Make it fit my model.

200
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,850
Professor, are you asking me to falsify data?

201
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm guiding you to the right path,

202
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,960
don't be ungrateful.

203
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,540
Take it back and fix it,

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,860
I want it in three days.

205
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,840
A scientist's mission is to explore facts

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,920
and pursue truth.

207
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
I've discovered the truth,

208
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,920
and you're asking me to alter it.

209
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,680
If I change it,

210
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,240
I'd be disrespecting the world

211
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,040
and disrespecting myself.

212
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
You want to respect the world

213
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,960
and respect yourself,

214
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,160
but have you thought about respecting me?

215
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
Luo Yan,

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
who rescued you from that sorghum field?

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
Who provided you with such a high-end

218
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
laboratory and sophisticated equipment?

219
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
And who gave you the opportunity

220
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,490
to collaborate with world-class companies?

221
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,840
You remember everyone else,

222
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,240
but forgot the one you should thank most.

223
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't want to see you.

224
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,320
Get out!

225
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
My experimental results weren't like this at all.

226
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,640
He tampered with my data.

227
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,920
Don't panic. Take your time.

228
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
My experiments showed that the Niels-Wu model

229
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,800
isn't applicable in all situations.

230
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,530
It has additional conditions.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,840
When he heard this, he flew into a rage

232
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,640
and told me to go back and change it.

233
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,680
But facts are facts.

234
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,880
How can I turn black into white?

235
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,640
I never imagined

236
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,200
that such a prominent academic figure

237
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,400
would so blatantly falsify data.

238
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,400
Calm down, calm down.

239
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,280
Yanzi, have a seat.

240
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,640
He really went too far.

241
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,880
Have some water.

242
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,680
Lao Xiang, what should I do now?

243
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
What do you want to do?

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
Academic fraud is a crime in the US,

245
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,440
it's a serious offense,

246
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
senior.

247
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
If Mr. Wu isn't worried,

248
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,360
why are you?

249
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
I'm aware of what's happening,

250
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
and if I don't report it,

251
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,600
if this ever comes to light, I'll be considered an accomplice.

252
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll be held liable too!

253
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,440
Actually,

254
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,080
with such specialized academic papers,

255
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,960
the chances of fraud being exposed are minimal.

256
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,600
Think about it,

257
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,060
didn't you mention before

258
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,880
that you spent 500 hours on experiments

259
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,600
to get these results?

260
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
So consider this:

261
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,840
who would be willing to spend another 500 hours

262
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,920
just to verify if your data is accurate?

263
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,120
just to verify if your data is accurate?

264
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
Xiang, you've changed.

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,120
I still remember your speech.

266
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,520
I still remember your speech,

267
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,250
I still remember what you said.

268
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,520
I, Xiang Nongchao, in this lifetime,

269
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,880
swear allegiance to only two things:

270
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,040
the woman I love and the truth.

271
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,820
And now you're saying these things to me,

272
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,600
it's truly terrifying.

273
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Yanzi.

274
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,960
When you've been like me,

275
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,320
walking on eggshells, treading on thin ice.

276
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,680
When you've struggled alone in a foreign country for seven years

277
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,720
and still can't get your degree,

278
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,080
you'll learn to compromise and make concessions.

279
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
You'll discover that this world

280
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,370
isn't just black and white.

281
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,400
Sometimes turning a blind eye

282
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,360
isn't wrong.

283
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
Do you think this kind of fraud

284
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,840
is Mr. Wu's first time?

285
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,820
It's been old news for a long time.

286
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,970
You report it to the school,

287
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
they send someone to investigate,

288
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,200
and then what?

289
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,320
You'll have to find a new advisor

290
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
and start everything from scratch.

291
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,600
But what if they find nothing wrong with Professor Wu?

292
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,860
Your life will be miserable from then on.

293
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Since we've chosen to endure this.

294
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,320
Your degree is in Professor Wu's hands,

295
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
he is your master,

296
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,840
your god.

297
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,080
Yanzi, just give in.

298
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,720
Back then you advised me to leave,

299
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,380
but I couldn't make up my mind.

300
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,320
Now I finally have enough motivation.

301
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,780
This time I absolutely will not compromise.

302
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,680
Dear Professor Hepburn,

303
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,960
my name is Luo Yan,

304
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,000
and your recruitment information

305
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,880
has greatly caught my interest.

306
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,280
First, let me introduce myself.

307
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Welcome!

308
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,880
Welcome, Xixi.

309
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,800
Just call me Jessica from now on.

310
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,760
Hello, Jessica.

311
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
Welcome, Xixi.

312
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,640
Hello, Mr. Zhuo.

313
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,680
Hello, Betty,

314
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,940
please take care of me.

315
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
Just as I thought.

316
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,040
What?

317
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,200
A plain gray hoodie,

318
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
silly overalls,

319
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,880
isn't this the typical nerd look?

320
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,320
Betty, be nice.

321
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,040
This is how students should dress,

322
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,240
unlike you with your bare shoulders

323
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
and exposed belly button.

324
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
That's what doesn't look like a student.

325
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,680
Alright, alright.

326
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,960
Let's be harmonious.

327
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,120
Cut the cake!

328
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Let Xixi and Betty cut the cake together.

329
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,880
From now on,

330
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
you'll be partners in daily life

331
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,800
and in your studies.

332
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
Take good care of each other.

333
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Come on!

334
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,160
Go ahead!

335
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,040
Let's stay out of each other's way from now on.

336
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,380
You mean, mind your own business.

337
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,600
Cut!

338
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Zhuopeng, take the flowers on the table.

339
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,360
They're for Betty.

340
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,680
Got it.

341
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,160
I've been thinking,

342
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,760
it's not convenient for you while pregnant,

343
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
the filming site is so chaotic,

344
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,290
you'd better not go.

345
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,800
No way,

346
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,560
I promised Betty,

347
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,960
and I need to keep my word.

348
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,880
Thank you so much this time, Lin Yao,

349
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
for all your help.

350
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
If it weren't for you,

351
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,360
I wouldn't know how to convince Betty.

352
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,890
Which one looks better?

353
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,960
This one.

354
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,960
Actually,

355
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
I need to ask for a favor.

356
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,760
What is it?

357
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,160
Anything I can help with.

358
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,840
There's a way now

359
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,440
to pay off all my debts.

360
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
What solution do you have in mind?

361
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,920
There's an investor proposing to acquire Lizhong Education.

362
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,400
Acquire Lizhong Education?

363
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
They're a listed company,

364
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,680
after the acquisition,

365
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,560
they plan to expand Lizhong Education

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
and turn it into a nationwide chain.

367
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,119
I... I never thought about selling Lizhong Education.

368
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,960
But if you agree,

369
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,760
it would not only pay off all my debts,

370
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,400
you'd also make a fortune.

371
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,839
Lin Yao, you know that

372
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,839
Lizhong Education isn't just my own hard work.

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,329
I don't think I have the right to make this decision on my own.

374
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,640
I... I understand.

375
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm sorry,

376
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,920
I really can't help you with this.

377
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
It's okay,

378
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,560
let's drop it.

379
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,290
I'll put this back and we can go.

380
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,640
Hello, Dad.

381
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
What? You're already at the airport?

382
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,240
I'll come pick you up right away.

383
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,160
How did he know you were here?

384
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,400
He must have heard some rumors.

385
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,960
This is quite strange.

386
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,200
What should we do?

387
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,440
He's already landed.

388
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,480
Don't worry,

389
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,240
I'll go pick him up.

390
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
You stay here, okay?

391
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,640
Don't panic. I'll go right away.

392
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,040
Where's Lin Yao?

393
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,200
She's pregnant,

394
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,360
car rides are uncomfortable for her,

395
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,020
she's waiting for you at home.

396
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,920
What's really going on with Lin Yao?

397
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,920
Why isn't Jiang Zhenghao with her?

398
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,160
Businessmen are always flying here and there.

399
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,960
Don't worry, Mr. Lin,

400
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,640
Lin Yao is at home taking care of her pregnancy,

401
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
nothing's wrong.

402
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,560
She's having his baby and he's not even here.

403
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,490
Everyone's keeping me in the dark.

404
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,120
Dad.

405
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,690
So you still remember I'm your father.

406
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,760
Ms. Lin, let's talk this through calmly.

407
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,200
She's pregnant.

408
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
Why aren't you in New York?

409
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
I came here for my pregnancy.

410
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
You see, I have friends here,

411
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,040
a familiar environment,

412
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm happier living here,

413
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,810
which is better for the baby's health.

414
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,040
You came here alone with no one to keep you company.

415
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,280
Where's Jiang?

416
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,480
How did you end up like this?

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,080
Zhenghao is busy with work,

418
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
he can't come.

419
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,520
Still so stubborn.

420
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,560
Jiang Zhenghao has abandoned you.

421
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,960
Dad,

422
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,840
who's been feeding you this nonsense?

423
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,560
Don't listen to those rumors.

424
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,290
The truth will always come out.

425
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,320
I told you before. He's 20 years older than you,

426
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,400
old enough to be your father.

427
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,520
You think he truly loves you?

428
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,040
He just wants you because you're young and pretty.

429
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,520
Look at you. You've had his child,

430
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,680
and does he take care of you?

431
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,400
Where is he?

432
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,730
Did you fly all this way just to lecture me?

433
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
You don't want me to be happy, do you?

434
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,920
Lin Yao.

435
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,320
I don't want you to have a good life.

436
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,400
You.

437
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,400
Ms. Lin! Ms. Lin!

438
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
What's wrong? What's wrong?

439
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,240
Dad, are you okay?

440
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,120
My father is having an attack.

441
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,880
Quick, get his medicine!

442
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,520
Where's the medicine? Where is it?

443
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,840
Jacket pocket. Jacket pocket.

444
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,960
Medicine.

445
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
Here, take this.

446
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,280
Good.

447
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,520
Okay, don't rush, don't rush.

448
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

449
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,520
It's okay.

450
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
Oh my God, I'm late!

451
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,680
Mom, don't wait for me for dinner.

452
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,480
Sister Gu Nian,

453
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,210
you should come visit me often.

454
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,400
Where did Betty go?

455
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't know.

456
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,480
What fell?

457
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,960
This must be Betty's script.

458
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
Huang Xin'er.

459
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,250
Is this the short film Betty's going to act in?

460
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,440
Yes, she showed it to me.

461
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,770
Do you know where they're filming?

462
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I need to find her,

463
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,810
this film can't be made.

464
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,600
I'll... I'll send you the address later.

465
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
Our start time was 10 o'clock

466
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,600
and we're already 20 minutes behind,

467
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
so everyone needs to pick up the pace.

468
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
For the lighting team,

469
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,080
we need some warm lighting from the side lights on the left.

470
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,280
And regarding the sound,

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,800
the sound... the sound.

472
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,120
Hey, Gu Nian,

473
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,800
this is Lin Yao.

474
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,080
Zhuo Peng is busy right now.

475
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,680
Is there something you need?

476
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,240
No, nothing.

477
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,360
Forget it. Better to rely on myself than others.

478
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,720
Action.

479
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,480
Is there anything

480
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,410
I can help you with, new classmate?

481
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
Sister.

482
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,360
I've always looked forward to college life,

483
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,400
and I want to

484
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,720
have a boyfriend.

485
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,560
What's going on?

486
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,400
Can't you remember just two lines?

487
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm sorry, really sorry.

488
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Come on, how can you call yourself an actor?

489
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,800
Let's try again.

490
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm asking if you're done with this.

491
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,880
Who called cut?

492
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,160
Huang Xin'er, you lied to me.

493
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
What did I lie about?

494
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,960
That video we recorded at dinner

495
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,480
wasn't for completing an assignment at all,

496
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,960
but for your student council campaign.

497
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,800
We're filming here!

498
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,280
Why are you causing trouble?

499
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,200
I was just preparing for the student council election,

500
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
what's wrong with that?

501
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,560
Running for election isn't the problem,

502
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,840
but you can't go around disparaging Chinese people

503
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,320
just to make yourself look better.

504
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
Don't you think that's despicable?

505
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,160
I don't understand what you're saying.

506
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,080
You think Chinese international students are like this,

507
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,800
and actually they really are like this,

508
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,560
but I'm different from them.

509
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,720
What is this?

510
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,280
These are just some transitional lines.

511
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,280
Okay, I'll continue reading.

512
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,440
These are the answers

513
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,080
to interview questions for Chinese Student Association members in your script.

514
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,340
Saint Helen is nothing but an empty name,

515
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,400
really just trying to glorify itself.

516
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,920
What's the meaning of life?

517
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,200
I just want to get through these years quickly.

518
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
Those campus cultural festivals

519
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,080
are nothing but empty formalism without any substance.

520
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,040
You're taking things out of context

521
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,040
just to put others down and make yourself look better.

522
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,400
Get out!

523
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,240
I'll leave when I'm finished speaking.

524
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,000
And you got her to play

525
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
a brainless student

526
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
who only thinks about dating

527
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,480
and how to find a boyfriend.

528
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
Is this how you see Chinese female students

529
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
studying abroad?

530
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
What right do you have to interfere with me?

531
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm going to interfere anyway.

532
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,480
You can say I love making friends, that's fine,

533
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
but you can't call others nerds,

534
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,080
and you definitely can't use Chinese international students as your reference point.

535
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,800
Aren't you just a nerd?

536
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,880
If you have a problem,

537
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,040
you can compete with me fairly,

538
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,570
what's this supposed to be?

539
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,680
I think you're just here to cause trouble, aren't you?

540
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,280
Fine, let's compete fairly.

541
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
Then I'm telling you now,

542
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,860
I've decided to run for student council.

543
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,240
Fine, we'll see about that.

544
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
Betty, are you coming or not?

545
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
I'll count to three.

546
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,280
Three, two...

547
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
Do you know

548
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,720
Gu Nian?

549
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,040
Not really,

550
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,920
let's just continue.

551
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,840
So,

552
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,240
you two are working together to cause trouble, right?

553
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,720
Fine. Sam, get someone else.

554
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,800
Replace her immediately.

555
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,330
She's completely useless.

556
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
Betty, why did you come out?

557
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,720
Are you satisfied now?

558
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,720
No, listen to my explanation.

559
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Betty,

560
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,080
what Huang Xin'er is producing

561
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,880
is smearing us Chinese.

562
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
Zhuopeng, you're here.

563
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,920
Where's Gu Nian?

564
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
In Betty's room.

565
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,180
They've been arguing,

566
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,360
your presence won't help.

567
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,760
Betty has already exploded.

568
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,940
I can't handle her,

569
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,780
and I think Gu Nian can't take it anymore either.

570
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,360
When she

571
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,280
goes crazy, she won't listen to anything.

572
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,120
It's better to let her fend for herself.

573
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,920
Art! Do you understand art?

574
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,600
You make a scene and walk away

575
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,080
leaving me in such an awkward position.

576
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,760
I finally got a chance to be in a film,

577
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,880
and you just have to ruin it, don't you?

578
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,120
What do you want me to do then?

579
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,840
I want you to get lost.

580
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,880
Betty, don't.

581
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,520
Lin Yao,

582
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,320
I don't know why,

583
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,200
but Gu Nian won't let me do this film.

584
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm not stopping you from doing this film.

585
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,200
I just told you so much—

586
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,480
Gu Nian, could you please stop talking?

587
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,520
I know what happened.

588
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,880
Let's talk about it when we get back.

589
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,810
You know? What exactly do you know?

590
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,800
Betty was in Huang Xin'er's campaign video,

591
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,120
and you went there to cause trouble?

592
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,680
Yes, she was just making trouble.

593
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
You don't know anything.

594
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,080
In that video, she's playing someone who knows nothing

595
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,040
and only cares about making friends.

596
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,000
Please shut up, will you?

597
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,840
You're just jealous of Lin Yao, okay?

598
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,480
She managed to arrange for Chen Yingxi to stay at my place,

599
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,520
something you clearly couldn't accomplish.

600
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,280
I think you're just here to cause trouble because you can't stand it,

601
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
this is revenge, isn't it?

602
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
That's not what Sister Gu Nian meant.

603
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,560
You shut up too, will you?

604
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,520
Get out!

605
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Betty, can we stick to the facts?

606
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,960
I'm grateful that Lin Yao could help you,

607
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,480
but there are problems with this script, that's a fact.

608
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,040
Gu Nian, please stop talking, okay?

609
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,360
So I'm not even allowed to speak now?

610
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,820
What you need right now is to calm down, okay?

611
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,080
Fine.

612
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Gu Nian.

613
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,160
Gu Nian.

614
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
Gu Nian.

615
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,720
Gu Nian.

616
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,600
You've been crying.

617
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,120
You know Betty's personality.

618
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,760
How can confronting her solve anything?

619
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,480
Besides, what you did was inappropriate.

620
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,640
I don't think so.

621
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,080
Given another chance, I'd do the same thing.

622
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,640
Regardless of whether you have the right

623
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,320
to interfere with someone else's campaign,

624
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
haven't you considered that

625
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,040
Lin Yao finally won Betty over,

626
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,480
and now with your outburst,

627
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,160
how is Chen Yingxi supposed to manage at Betty's house?

628
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,400
It's because of Lin Yao,

629
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
isn't it? You're criticizing me because of her?

630
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No. What are you really upset about?

631
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,120
Does it matter?

632
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,040
I thought no matter what happened,

633
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
you would always take my side,

634
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,360
but I was wrong.

635
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,440
There aren't so many guarantees in this world,

636
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,640
and even if there were, they wouldn't be for me.

637
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,240
Gu Nian, can't you be more straightforward

638
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
and just say what you mean?

639
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,080
There's one thing you said that was right.

640
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,840
What?

641
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
I'm not thinking clearly right now.

642
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, shut up!

643
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,360
Gu Nian!

644
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,850
Don't follow me!

645
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,860
Makes a mistake and then kicks me.

646
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,880
Gu Nian.

647
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,520
Is this your campaign video plan?

648
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,360
We had some unexpected issues today,

649
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,040
so we couldn't finish everything.

650
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,320
What do you think?

651
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,040
Have you considered that

652
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,240
the entire school will see this video?

653
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,200
That's exactly what I want,

654
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,440
otherwise why would I make it?

655
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,400
Aren't you afraid of alienating the Chinese students?

656
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,200
So what if I do?

657
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,120
I don't need their few votes anyway.

658
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,920
There's a Chinese saying about sacrificing the small to gain the big.

659
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,160
Though I'm sacrificing them,

660
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,490
I'll gain approval from many more people.

661
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,040
And I, Huang Xin'er, want to establish

662
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,120
an image completely different

663
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,560
from other Chinese students.

664
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm sure they'll vote for me.

665
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,480
Ivy, your thinking is completely wrong.

666
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,080
How could it be?

667
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,840
It seems you still don't understand

668
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,440
mainstream culture abroad.

669
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,000
In our society,

670
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,730
racial discrimination is a very serious matter.

671
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,880
By distancing yourself

672
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,720
from other Chinese students,

673
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,600
you're already showing signs of racial discrimination,

674
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,800
and worse, you're discriminating against your own people.

675
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,560
Someone who doesn't respect their own people

676
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,890
will never be respected by others.

677
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
So what should I do now?

678
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,560
The problem is I've already shot it like this,

679
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,720
and there's no time to change it now.

680
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Abandon this video.

681
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,410
Win over the Chinese students.

682
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,000
Do you have class tomorrow?

683
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,720
No.

684
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,400
Perfect, come with me then.

685
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,040
What for?

686
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,440
To sit-in at the company and protest.

687
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm not going.

688
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,520
But you don't have class, right?

689
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,680
I already said I'm not going,

690
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,280
so stop bothering me.

691
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
What's going on?

692
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,920
Look at you,

693
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,320
not eating, not watching TV,

694
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,200
just sitting there like a zombie.

695
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,160
I'm feeling troubled.

696
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,200
How can I help if you don't tell me what's wrong?

697
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,560
I'm trying to figure out how to win over the Chinese students,

698
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,760
how could you possibly help with that?

699
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,000
Can you?

700
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,480
That's easy!

701
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,600
Treat them to meals, use the sugar-coated bullet approach.

702
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,280
Haven't I taught you this before?

703
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,480
Stop talking nonsense.

704
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,010
You don't know anything about the situation.

705
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,680
Here's what we'll do. Come to the company tomorrow,

706
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,560
there'll be food and drinks,

707
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,490
and you can think it through there.

708
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,360
Alright, it's settled then.

709
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,880
Enough, stop overthinking.

710
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,560
Jessica will be back soon.

711
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,720
Please have a seat.

712
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,360
Of course I know.

713
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,440
I'm fully aware of her schedule.

714
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,560
Have some more tea.

715
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,360
Don't think you're off the hook.

716
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,240
If I were you, I'd rush to the legal department

717
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,600
to figure out the follow-up issues

718
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
and prepare for a lawsuit.

719
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm sorry.

720
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,760
Please have some cookies first.

721
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,320
Jessica,

722
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,840
there's a document that needs your signature.

723
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,520
Okay.

724
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,920
That woman is here again.

725
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,880
I know.

726
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,040
She's been coming for a week now.

727
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,760
It's annoying how she just sits there every day.

728
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,280
Everything alright?

729
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,360
It's fine.

730
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
If she comes,

731
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,320
just treat her well

732
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
and then continue with your work.

733
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,120
Okay, I'll get back to work then.

734
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,240
Coco, have you finished your own tasks?

735
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,800
Are you that bored?

736
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
I'll go get busy then.

737
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
What are you playing at?

738
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,920
Sending her away as soon as you return,

739
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,560
afraid I'll scold her,

740
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,520
or worried she might slip up

741
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,760
and I'll catch you?

742
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,090
You've misunderstood.

743
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,480
Coco really does have a lot of work to do.

744
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,320
Your company is quite bold,

745
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,520
still daring to employ her.

746
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,850
You really have no fear.

747
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,520
Rest assured,

748
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,240
all our employees have professional qualifications.

749
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,560
You know perfectly well about those qualifications.

750
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,040
But if your company doesn't give me an explanation,

751
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,100
I'll just keep coming here every day.

752
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,400
Ms. Li,

753
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,719
you are our company's valued client,

754
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,199
and you're always welcome here.

755
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,360
Keke.

756
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,719
Li Mei is here again.

757
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,239
She's been coming for many days in a row,

758
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,560
and we don't dare upset her,

759
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,159
serving her the best food and drinks every day.

760
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,480
Just let her come,

761
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,740
don't be afraid of her.

762
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm not afraid of her,

763
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,420
I just feel guilty.

764
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,040
If I had known taking the exam for someone else would be so nerve-wracking,

765
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,570
I'd rather not have gotten this certificate.

766
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,320
Keke, remember this,

767
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,320
your certificate is real,

768
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,280
your qualification is real,

769
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,280
there's nothing to be afraid of.

770
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,360
Tell me,

771
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,400
is this matter really taken care of properly?

772
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
Of course it is.

773
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
I wouldn't possibly leave any evidence,

774
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
so relax.

775
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,840
This matter,

776
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,280
only you, me, heaven and earth know about it,

777
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,440
no one else.

778
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,040
I'm still feeling uneasy.

779
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,400
Alright, alright, let's not talk about it now,

780
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,730
we'll discuss it later.

781
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,440
Mom, let's go home.

782
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,320
Where are you going?

783
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,760
It's no use sitting here.

784
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,960
I'll tell you when we get home. Let's go.

785
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,880
You have something to discuss?

786
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,560
You should have said so earlier.

787
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,200
Jessica, I'll come back tomorrow.

788
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,400
Why did you make a scene and drag me out?

789
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,120
Mom, that person who helped you buy the house,

790
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,240
was her name Zhu Keke?

791
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,000
Yes, it was.

792
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,880
Do you still have her ID information?

793
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,360
I do. It's all written in the contract.

794
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,240
Good, that makes things easier.

795
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,280
Mom, we need to sue them.

796
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Filing a lawsuit?

797
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,360
Lawsuits in America are such a hassle.

798
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,800
They cost a fortune and drag on forever.

799
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,520
The thing is,

800
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,250
I already signed the contract,

801
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,840
and they're not letting it go,

802
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
so I can't get the upper hand.

803
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,320
Mom, just trust me.

804
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,650
You find a lawyer and I'll handle the rest.

805
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,920
This person took the exam for someone else.

806
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,520
Can you help me find a way to investigate?

807
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,280
Test-taking for others has its own code of conduct.

808
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,360
The information is private and won't be disclosed casually.

809
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Yanzi.

810
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,880
Senior, please sit down.

811
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,000
Senior, I've come to say goodbye.

812
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,920
I've contacted other schools,

813
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,880
and found a professor willing to take me.

814
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,440
My flight is tomorrow noon.

815
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,120
Did Professor Wu approve your transfer?

816
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,440
I wasn't planning to tell him.

817
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,200
If Professor Wu doesn't sign,

818
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,640
you can't transfer.

819
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,480
I'll forfeit these credits.

820
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,520
I'll just consider this time

821
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,450
as if I joined some pyramid scheme.

822
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,560
Where is your new school?

823
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,400
The central region where few people live.

824
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
Can you get used to living there?

825
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
As long as I can get away from Old Wu,

826
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,890
I'm willing to give it a try.

827
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,050
Are you really sure about this?

828
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,800
Only by giving up everything

829
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
can I gain my freedom.

830
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,960
I'm sorry. It's my fault for getting you into this.

831
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Senior,

832
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,480
there's something I hope you'll be honest with me about.

833
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,040
I think I know what you want to ask.

834
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Why did Old Wu suddenly

835
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,920
agree to accept a student from another school?

836
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,700
If you didn't come, I couldn't leave.

837
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,760
Without someone to fill my position,

838
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,620
I would never be able to graduate.

839
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,730
So it was true after all.

840
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,560
That post you shared on social media

841
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
about the professor recruiting students

842
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,360
was actually just bait.

843
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,640
I took the bait

844
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,170
and became your bargaining chip for freedom.

845
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,400
I can't believe this truth,

846
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,060
and I don't want to believe it.

847
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm sorry.

848
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,480
When it comes down to it,

849
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,760
I was just too eager for

850
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,720
the Saint Helen's prestige.

851
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,280
I'm just facing the consequences of my own choices.

852
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,680
You're not at fault. Saint Helen's isn't either.

853
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,480
The villain is Old Wu.

854
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,760
And me.

855
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
But if I leave like this,

856
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,560
won't Old Wu make things difficult for you?

857
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,640
You haven't defended your thesis yet.

858
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,600
What if because I left,

859
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,730
he doesn't let you defend your thesis?

860
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,440
Yanzi, when you talk like that, it makes me feel even worse.

861
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,080
Though Old Wu is despicable,

862
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,000
but

863
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,240
I've worked hard under him for so many years.

864
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,200
Even if I haven't made great achievements, I've put in the effort.

865
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
Besides, the school has regulations

866
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,320
that PhD students in our program can study for a maximum of seven years,

867
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,760
and I've already been here for six and a half years.

868
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,240
I should be almost through this ordeal.

869
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,760
Let's hope he still has a tiny bit of mercy left for you.

870
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,520
I actually thought

871
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,720
we could work on some project together.

872
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,280
Who would have thought.

873
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,600
Senior,

874
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,120
take care.

875
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,480
Who knows when we'll see each other again.

876
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,440
Hey, didn't I say we'd video chat later?

877
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,040
Why are you calling so urgently?

878
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,170
I have good news to tell you right away.

879
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,080
Now, Zheng Xiangdong thinks

880
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,640
that you're unwilling to sell Lizhong Education,

881
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,440
so he's offering new terms.

882
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,280
After the deal goes through,

883
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,640
he'll make you the CEO of Yangfan Education.

884
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,280
Make me the CEO?

885
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,960
A small company like Lizhong Education

886
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,680
can sell for millions,

887
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,880
and you'll become the CEO.

888
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,360
You can completely turn your life around.

889
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,720
This is the best possible outcome.

890
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,680
I told you,

891
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,880
I tried to negotiate but failed,

892
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
not that I was unwilling.

893
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,650
Someone like Zheng Xiangdong won't just let this go.

894
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,280
He's negotiating nicely with you now,

895
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,600
you'd better accept.

896
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,880
If you don't agree,

897
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,840
a person like him,

898
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,640
I don't know what he might do.

899
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
My dad came to Seattle a few days ago,

900
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,160
saying he heard that Lao Jiang and I were having problems.

901
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,000
Besides Zheng Xiangdong causing trouble,

902
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I can't think of anyone else

903
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,060
who would tell my father such things.

904
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,280
