1
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,479
I'm sorry, Nian Nian,

2
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,640
I don't think I can make it to rehearsals anymore.

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
What?

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,600
How am I supposed to find someone to replace you at this point?

5
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,479
I'm so sorry, Nian Nian.

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
I knew my twitching right eyelid was a bad omen.

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,600
If there's no other option, maybe Eva could try.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Eva?

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
Is she up for it?

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
She'll have to be,

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,220
after all, Eva's English is pretty good,

12
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,840
so she should be able to memorize the lines quickly.

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,280
I guess we'll have to make do with what we've got.

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
Fine, we have no other choice.

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,960
I'll call her now and tell her.

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,340
Tell her to get familiar with the script right away.

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm hanging up now.

18
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,760
Everyone, this is Eva.

19
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,680
Hello everyone, I'm Eva.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,760
Nice to meet you all.

21
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,320
Since Huang Xin'er is sick,

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
I'll be taking her place,

23
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,040
and I hope we can work well together.

24
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,280
Alright, let's continue rehearsing.

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,080
Okay, everyone.

26
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,840
Have you all read the script?

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,480
Yes.

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
Then let's run through it once.

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,060
You'll enter from over there.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,240
Okay.

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,079
Hello.

32
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,800
This is my first time doing theater,

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,520
and I'm not familiar with a lot of things,

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,650
so I hope you can give me some guidance.

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Don't be nervous. Just relax and perform.

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
By the way, do you have a script?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Not yet.

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,400
Thank you.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,240
You're in the third...

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,040
The third act.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,480
Right.

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,560
So this scene might be everyone...

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
Could you help me run through my lines?

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,440
Sure.

45
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,140
There are still many empty seats.

46
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,090
It's the first show, don't worry about it.

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,240
Even if there's only one person,

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,640
we still need to give our best performance.

49
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,760
I see Juan.

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
Do you see her?

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Juan.

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,800
She brought all her classmates from her department,

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,660
the ones I know.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,580
Your parents are here too.

55
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,880
Dad.

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,400
My daughter directed this.

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,440
My daughter directed this. Go for it!

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
My parents told me

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,530
they won't miss a single performance.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,720
Alright then.

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,780
Let's go get ready.

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Okay.

63
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,280
Good luck!

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Let's do this!

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,480
Chuan, I cannot let you graduate.

66
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,440
These are all lies.

67
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
Would you be my mentor?

68
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm afraid I can't.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
Would you be my mentor?

70
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,159
No.

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
Would you be my mentor?

72
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
No.

73
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
Would you be my mentor?

74
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
No.

75
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,560
Go back, you cowardly deserter.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,720
At this moment, Li Chuan

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
after being rejected by all other mentors,

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,090
becomes emotionally unstable

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,760
and develops a personality completely opposite to his previous one.

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
Is your existence merely

81
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,360
to cause trouble for others?

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
You're right.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Thank you.

84
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
Thank you for discovering the value of my life.

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,120
So my existence isn't worthless after all.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,280
My value is to cause trouble for others,

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,600
that's my purpose.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,200
Wang Lei, thank you.

89
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
Mom.

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,720
I'm so tired.

91
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,800
Son,

92
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,200
say something,

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
son!

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Goodbye, world.

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,160
Goodbye, Saint Helen.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,280
Goodbye, Mom.

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,840
Farewell.

98
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,880
Goodbye to the black cat at the library,

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,200
and the cucumber sandwiches from the cafeteria.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
Goodbye.

101
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,320
Life is an adventure,

102
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,320
and I have fought the good fight.

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,360
Even though I lost.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,000
It's time to go home,

105
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,080
back to where I came from.

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,160
The eternal

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
dreamland.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,760
I think so too.

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Come on, hurry up and cut the cake, Dad.

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,040
Please welcome the writer and director of our play,

111
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Gu Nian,

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,200
everyone.

113
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,200
Okay.

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,130
Thank you all for coming to this performance.

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,480
First, I want to say

116
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm not trying to defend Song Zhiyang with this play.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,880
I hope if anyone is like Song Zhiyang,

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,440
suffering from mental illness,

119
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,360
they can learn to open up

120
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,600
and seek professional help before tragedy strikes.

121
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Song Zhiyang was a patient.

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,200
May the dead rest in peace,

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
and the living grow stronger.

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
Thank you all.

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
Look at this one:

126
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
Children are not tools for parents to fulfill their dreams,

127
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,120
please don't impose your

128
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,250
unfulfilled dreams on your children.

129
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,560
I like this one:

130
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,480
He says we can't expect everyone to be kind,

131
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,760
it's enough if most people can tell right from wrong.

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,820
I hope everyone will go see this play,

133
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,930
and afterward understand that

134
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,560
individual actions are just individual actions.

135
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,290
There's a reply to his comment:

136
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm Black,

137
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,560
and I completely agree with your point,

138
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,620
reject all forms of discrimination.

139
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,800
Gu Nian,

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,730
isn't that exactly why you're staging this play?

141
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,640
I hope his death can have meaning.

142
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
There's another show tonight,

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,280
I hope more people will come see our play.

144
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,440
It definitely will be. With such success

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
our reputation has already spread.

146
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Tonight will definitely be packed.

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
By the way, Xin'er

148
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,560
are you feeling better?

149
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,760
I'm almost completely recovered

150
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,820
thanks for asking.

151
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,960
Eva, Ivy.

152
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,000
What is it?

153
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Eva

154
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
you performed last night

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,200
and had your fill of stage time

156
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,160
could you let me

157
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,520
perform the final show tonight?

158
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,780
How could you say that?

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,200
It's just like having alternating roles

160
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,280
you do one show, I do one show

161
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,680
it's completely normal.

162
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,570
If you're going to be nice, be nice all the way.

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,240
Ivy, I'm not trying to criticize you

164
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,200
but you shouldn't have come for last night's show

165
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
aren't you just inviting people to be suspicious of us?

166
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,520
But I really want to perform.

167
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,080
Hello

168
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,760
Eva.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
Ivy, you helped me get this role,

170
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,740
and I'll always remember your kindness.

171
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
But

172
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,840
if you go on stage tonight,

173
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
people will get suspicious,

174
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,280
and all our efforts will be wasted.

175
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
Is that what you want?

176
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,760
I...

177
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,370
Enough, say no more.

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
I need to fix my hair,

179
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,720
touch up my makeup and stuff.

180
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,040
You should go now.

181
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Eva...

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,160
Nian Nian.

183
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,360
Xin'er.

184
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,840
Um...

185
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
I came to check on Eva.

186
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
You go ahead with your work.

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,780
Good luck with your performance.

188
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,440
Thank you.

189
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,920
Thanks.

190
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,520
Gu Nian,

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,160
let's go get some late-night snacks.

192
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,040
You're the star tonight,

193
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,520
everyone's waiting for you.

194
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,160
You guys go ahead,

195
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,720
I'll join you as soon as I finish up here.

196
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,640
Alright, don't take too long,

197
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:42,880
okay,

198
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,740
we'll go first.

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Xin'er, let's go together.

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,920
It's fine. I'll stay with Gu Nian.

201
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,850
You all go ahead.

202
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm leaving now. Bye,

203
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,520
bye.

204
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,520
Why did you give your role to Eva?

205
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,840
Judging by your reaction,

206
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,000
I must be right.

207
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
What could I do?

208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
It was really difficult.

209
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,570
Were you faking being sick?

210
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
Why would you do that?

211
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,010
Because you didn't give Eva a role.

212
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,720
So you just gave her yours.

213
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,890
I don't understand.

214
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,880
You put in so much effort

215
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,240
to get this role.

216
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
You were so brilliant at your first audition,

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,130
you were the first actor we confirmed,

218
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,240
and now you're the only one who didn't perform.

219
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Well, Eva did a good job too.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,260
Are you being sincere?

221
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
What can I do?

222
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,680
Eva is my friend,

223
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,120
she really wants this role,

224
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,180
and I don't want to let my friend down.

225
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,520
Yes, I want this role too,

226
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,160
I also want to be on that stage.

227
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,880
But

228
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,860
I can only choose one side in this situation.

229
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
Maybe

230
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,840
I'll regret it no matter what I choose.

231
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,500
This situation is bound to end with regrets.

232
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,440
Come on, let's go,

233
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,770
they're waiting for us.

234
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,680
Forget it, I didn't even perform,

235
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,880
I have no right to join the celebration.

236
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
Let's go.

237
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,040
You're part of this show too. Let's go.

238
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,920
Your bag.

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,880
Mom, you were amazing this time.

240
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,560
When you decide to act,

241
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
you really

242
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
blow everyone away.

243
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
Mom and Dad are really leaving this time.

244
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,040
If anything happens,

245
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,680
don't try to handle it all by yourself.

246
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,400
Take good care of yourselves too.

247
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,880
Don't worry about us.

248
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
To be honest,

249
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,130
the food here is absolutely terrible.

250
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,560
It's fine. He doesn't understand Chinese.

251
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,280
When you come back after summer break,

252
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,840
I'll take you out

253
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,040
and we'll have all your favorite foods.

254
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,360
Dad, your cooking is the best.

255
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,480
Good.

256
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,640
I can't lose this weight,

257
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,080
and it's all your fault.

258
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,000
How can it be all my fault?

259
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,400
Right.

260
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Nian Nian,

261
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,400
it's such a shame that Teacher Zhuo Peng

262
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,680
couldn't come today.

263
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,160
Otherwise, before leaving,

264
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,000
we should have treated him to another meal.

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,960
Yeah,

266
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,560
Teacher Zhuo is very busy,

267
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,760
you're really treating him like free labor.

268
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm not treating him like labor,

269
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
I see him as...

270
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,560
I've seen how well he takes care of you,

271
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
we wanted to thank him in person.

272
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,920
Yes, exactly.

273
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,920
Don't worry, I'll pass your thanks to him.

274
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,200
Take care of yourself,

275
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,260
drink plenty of water and eat fruits.

276
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,320
After we arrive safely,

277
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,480
we'll send you a message.

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,200
Alright.

279
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,200
Nian Nian, remember,

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
stay in touch with Zhuo Peng.

281
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,360
Mom, enough,

282
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,680
sit down properly now.

283
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,400
Okay.

284
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,480
Be careful.

285
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,240
The play was a great success.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,660
Professor Zhuo, you're here.

287
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,520
Your play has helped heal many anxious students,

288
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
did you know that?

289
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,440
Really?

290
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,520
Many students who had scheduled counseling sessions

291
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,650
have canceled them.

292
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,960
Professor Chris thinks this was

293
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,120
a somewhat risky but

294
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
very successful experiment.

295
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
He also asked me to

296
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,060
express his appreciation and gratitude to you.

297
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,010
Professor Zhuo,

298
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,780
Professor Chris told me everything.

299
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Thank you so much.

300
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,960
If it weren't for you,

301
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,560
I'd still be that coward afraid of nightmares.

302
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,920
No need to thank me.

303
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,240
I was mainly worried you'd cause trouble everywhere,

304
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,970
you were really difficult to deal with back then.

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,920
Really?

306
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,080
You probably weren't aware of it yourself.

307
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
But...

308
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,960
Anyway,

309
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
thank you,

310
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,040
sincerely.

311
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,880
What's this?

312
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,880
It's mint.

313
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Mint.

314
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,040
Avi.

315
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,380
To be honest, I'm really grateful to you,

316
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,440
if you hadn't given up your role to me,

317
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,640
I know I couldn't have played this role.

318
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,280
Why so formal?

319
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,920
I know you really wanted this role,

320
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
and I know you especially wanted to perform that final scene.

321
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,560
So?

322
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,920
I didn't let you perform,

323
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,320
you must feel pretty upset about it, right?

324
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,920
No, it's all in the past.

325
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,480
There's no need to deny it,

326
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,140
it's perfectly normal to feel unhappy about it.

327
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,680
Eva.

328
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,120
It's me.

329
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,040
Enjoy your drinks.

330
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,280
Thank you.

331
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,680
So I specifically invited you out for drinks today,

332
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,880
and to tell you a secret.

333
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,480
But I should warn you first,

334
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,960
you need to prepare yourself mentally,

335
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,280
don't get even more upset

336
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,640
after I tell you this.

337
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,280
What secret? You're making me nervous.

338
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,240
How's your relationship with Gu Nian?

339
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,560
That's such a sudden question,

340
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,290
I don't even know how to answer.

341
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,520
Actually, she and I...

342
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,400
Avi, listen carefully,

343
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,960
this play we've been fighting over,

344
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,240
is nothing but a by-product of psychological therapy,

345
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
it's not even worth mentioning.

346
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
What do you mean by that?

347
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,920
So you really don't know.

348
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,850
What are you talking about?

349
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
This play,

350
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
and everything related to it,

351
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
was all arranged by Zhuo Peng,

352
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,440
who asked Professor Chris to give Gu Nian

353
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,300
a form of psychological therapy.

354
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,360
Gu Nian has a psychological disorder

355
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,080
called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

356
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,520
They had her complete this assignment,

357
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
to write a script.

358
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
No, not write - they helped her write the script,

359
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
then helped her bring it to the stage,

360
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,720
so she could face her trauma directly,

361
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,680
and heal from it.

362
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,970
Do you understand what I'm saying?

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,130
That's impossible.

364
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
That would be way too elaborate.

365
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,520
Absolutely impossible.

366
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,380
Who would use an entire play to treat one person?

367
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,640
So you see,

368
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,000
how terrible is that?

369
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,600
We're just here to accompany the princess,

370
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
we're all just puppets, all supporting characters,

371
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
and only Gu Nian is the main character,

372
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,680
the only main character.

373
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,170
That's impossible.

374
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,280
When has my information ever been wrong?

375
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,840
This friend of yours is ridiculous,

376
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,800
what Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?

377
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,560
She's just being dramatic,

378
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,620
trying to get everyone's attention.

379
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,040
And that Zhuo Peng, seriously,

380
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,560
don't you think he must have feelings for Gu Nian?

381
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,020
Why else would he go out of his way to help her?

382
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,440
They're just playing with all of us.

383
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,000
Avi.

384
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm telling you seriously,

385
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
you should be careful around Gu Nian,

386
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,760
don't be too honest with her,

387
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,200
and you need to recognize who your real friends are.

388
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,380
Baby, have you been waiting long?

389
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,880
We're leaving now.

390
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,240
I invited him to see a movie today.

391
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,880
Hello.

392
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
You guys

393
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,520
We're dating.

394
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,040
When did this start?

395
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Right after the celebration party.

396
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,520
Honey

397
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,360
Could you get me a slice of cake to go?

398
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,800
We can eat it later during the movie.

399
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,260
Sure, you two chat for now.

400
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,720
Let me tell you something.

401
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,080
Why did I insist on being in this play?

402
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,760
It was all because of him.

403
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,720
If I wasn't in this play,

404
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,680
how would I ever get close to him?

405
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,040
Right.

406
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,440
Now my wish has come true.

407
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,680
I'll tell you two secrets today,

408
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,160
consider it repaying your favor.

409
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,560
What secrets are you talking about? I was only gone for a minute.

410
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,120
Just girl talk.

411
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,640
We're heading out.

412
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,360
Bye, Aiwei.

413
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,280
See you another day.

414
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,840
Bye-bye.

415
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,160
Mom

416
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,040
I'm serious this time.

417
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,400
I can't be around Gu Nian anymore.

418
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,600
It's either her or me.

419
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,400
What's going on?

420
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,130
Why the sudden change of heart?

421
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,920
I just found out

422
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,520
that Gu Nian's script and her rehearsals

423
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,250
were all arranged by Zhuo Peng.

424
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,080
All to treat her so-called

425
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,410
post-traumatic stress disorder.

426
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,280
And to think I worked so hard for that role,

427
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,560
even got upset when I lost it.

428
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,120
Only to end up as a prop in someone else's story.

429
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,960
What kind of nonsense is this?

430
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,680
By the way, what's wrong with Gu Nian?

431
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,560
What illness?

432
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,920
There's no illness at all.

433
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,280
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

434
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,200
Is she the only one who's fragile and sensitive?

435
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,960
So all our efforts

436
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,520
were just to treat her condition?

437
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,960
That's ridiculous!

438
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,360
Then my sacrifice was completely worthless.

439
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,480
I just wanted to sincerely

440
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,120
make a friend,

441
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,240
why is that so difficult?

442
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,960
There, there, sweetheart.

443
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,240
Didn't I tell you before?

444
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,360
Only family will truly care about you.

445
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,680
People outside will change their relationship with you

446
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
because of various interests.

447
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Alright, don't be sad.

448
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,440
Mom is still here for you.

449
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,520
I'll support you.

450
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,280
You just don't want to live in the dorm anymore, right?

451
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,480
Fine, I'll take you to look at apartments this afternoon,

452
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
and we'll move out tomorrow.

453
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,640
Okay.

454
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,200
Mom, you're always the best to me.

455
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,320
There, there, baby.

456
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
It's okay, don't cry.

457
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,900
What's wrong with Xin'er?

459
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,180
You're moving out of the dorm?

460
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Why so suddenly?

461
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,120
It's nothing.

462
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,320
I just can't get used to living in the dorm.

463
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,160
But you seemed fine living here before.

464
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,880
And if you leave,

465
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
I'll be all alone.

466
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,440
No, you won't.

467
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,140
Don't you have so many people who care about you?

468
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,640
What's wrong with you? You're talking strangely.

469
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
It's nothing.

470
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
My mom is waiting for me downstairs.

471
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,650
I'm leaving.

472
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,760
Xin'er, you're just leaving like this?

473
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,760
Gu Nian,

474
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,680
have you ever truly considered me a friend?

475
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Of course I have. Why would you ask that?

476
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,000
Xiao Xiang!

477
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,860
Hello, auntie.

478
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,760
Looking for Xiaoyun?

479
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Xiaoyun isn't here. She went out for a walk.

480
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,160
Where's Keke?

481
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,560
Keke is upstairs taking care of the child.

482
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,520
Auntie, please rest. Let me do this.

483
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,580
No, I can't let you do this rough work.

484
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,450
I feel uncomfortable if I don't keep busy.

485
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,120
Alright.

486
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,080
You look like someone who knows how to work.

487
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,730
Xiaoman.

488
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,720
She's asleep.

489
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,280
She's truly a little angel.

490
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,140
You seem to like children.

491
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Hurry up and find a wife

492
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,180
to have one of your own.

493
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,010
Who would want to be with me?

494
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
Keke is a good girl,

495
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,880
kind-hearted and capable.

496
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,340
Don't let Ma Xiaoyun boss you around all day.

497
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,620
Did we wake you?

498
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,840
Xiaoman.

499
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,840
Keke.

500
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,680
You just gave birth,

501
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,480
come and rest a bit more.

502
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,200
Give me the baby.

503
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,680
Okay.

504
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,120
Auntie will hold you.

505
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,480
She's still asleep.

506
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,610
She hasn't woken up,

507
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,880
she's sleeping,

508
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,610
fast asleep.

509
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,320
So sweet!

510
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,610
Something's up.

511
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,080
Hello,

512
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
good morning.

513
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
Is anyone home?

514
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,040
Good morning.

515
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,210
What can I do for you?

516
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Could I have some

517
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,320
of the tangerines from your yard?

518
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,160
Tangerines?

519
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,040
Those small tangerines growing in your yard,

520
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,520
there are so many of them,

521
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,540
and you're not even picking them.

522
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
Could you... no, I mean,

523
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,440
if you're not eating them, could you give me some?

524
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,680
You knocked on my door just to ask for some tangerines?

525
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,440
Yes.

526
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,500
If you want tangerines, go buy them at the supermarket.

527
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,720
An Asian woman

528
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,280
came by asking for tangerines from our backyard.

529
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,240
Tangerines?

530
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,160
Are you sure that's all she wanted?

531
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,560
That's what she said.

532
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,640
She's not a cop.

533
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,760
Doesn't seem like it. Her English wasn't even fluent.

534
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,160
Cops are the best at pretending.

535
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,020
She looked like she was pregnant.

536
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,120
That makes her even less suspicious to us.

537
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,160
Something's not right,

538
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,780
everyone should leave for today.

539
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Gunshots.

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,120
I don't know. I'll go check.

541
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,000
What the hell is this?

542
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,600
Hello.

543
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,840
What?

544
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,080
I'll be right there.

545
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,600
Keke, what's wrong?

546
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,680
Keke, help me,

547
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,180
they've kidnapped me.

548
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,360
My name is Coco.

549
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,440
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gonzalez.

550
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,520
You speak Spanish and you know who I am?

551
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,180
Just a little, sir.

552
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,040
You're the most respected person in the neighborhood.

553
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,640
Do you know her?

554
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,200
Of course, she's my relative.

555
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,360
If your relative is staying at your place,

556
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,960
you should take better care of her.

557
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,920
People come to my door asking for donations or help,

558
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,200
but nobody has ever asked me for oranges.

559
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,640
She must have ulterior motives.

560
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,560
Because yours are free.

561
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
Like this.

562
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
You like free stuff.

563
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,920
She says she likes it

564
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,080
too.

565
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,720
Who in this world doesn't like free things?

566
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,880
Right.

567
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,840
What are you doing?

568
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,120
Now, I'm treating you to these tangerines.

569
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,000
Eat all of them.

570
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,640
What are you all doing?

571
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,240
You scared me, ma'am.

572
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,440
You know what,

573
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,120
she's the one who wanted to eat oranges.

574
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,960
You're not leaving until you finish this basket of oranges.

575
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,960
No!

576
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
Stop!

577
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,840
Mr. Gonzalez,

578
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,120
I've always heard from neighbors that you're a true gentleman,

579
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,760
but forcing a pregnant woman like this

580
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,360
doesn't show any gentlemanly behavior at all.

581
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,520
Pregnant?

582
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,080
Pregnant women are extremely careful

583
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,880
to protect their babies.

584
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,280
But this lady completely disregarded safety

585
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,680
and threw oranges at my windows and door before running away.

586
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Since she doesn't care that she's pregnant,

587
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,500
why should I treat her like a pregnant woman?

588
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,320
Let her go.

589
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,480
I'll eat the rest of the oranges.

590
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,920
How touching.

591
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,000
You want to take her place?

592
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,120
Fine by me.

593
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,920
You've got quite a sharp tongue.

594
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,960
Time to shut that mouth of yours.

595
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,440
What are you doing?

596
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,880
Teaching her what happens when you offend a gentleman.

597
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,440
Do you know Diego Maldonado Gospel?

598
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,640
Diego,

599
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,880
yes,

600
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,720
he used to be my neighbor.

601
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,120
But I haven't seen him for over four years.

602
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,880
He gave you a parrot, didn't he?

603
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,320
No, it was a turkey.

604
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,680
Correct answer.

605
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,580
You can go home now.

606
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,400
Let's go.

607
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,970
That's outrageous.

608
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,200
These thugs, I'm calling the police.

609
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,440
I'll make sure they all go to jail.

610
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,440
Why are you glaring at me?

611
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,380
I'm the one who feels wronged.

612
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,120
Coco.

613
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,080
What's wrong?

614
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,080
What is it now?

615
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,680
Coco.

616
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,800
Coco.

617
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,920
Coco.

618
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,520
Coco.

619
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,280
Coco.

620
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,920
Coco, don't walk so fast.

621
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,840
Coco, what's wrong?

622
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,120
Tell me what happened.

623
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,920
Coco.

624
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,960
Coco, please explain what's going on.

625
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,290
What are you doing here?

626
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Stay away from me!

627
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,720
I'm worried about you.

628
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,120
Who asked for your help!

629
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,580
This is all because of you!

630
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Go ahead, hit me,

631
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,720
as long as it makes you feel better,

632
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,650
you can beat me to death if you want.

633
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,850
I must have owed you in my past life.

634
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,520
We've never run out of fruit at home,

635
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,080
yet you had to pick someone else's.

636
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,760
Do you know who Gonzales is?

637
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,800
He's a gangster.

638
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,130
Nobody in that area dares to mess with him.

639
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,500
Can't we just call the police?

640
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,280
Call the police?

641
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,400
Are you kidding me?

642
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,560
Before they'd arrest Gonzales,

643
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
they'd arrest me first.

644
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,440
Ever since I opened this postpartum center,

645
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,920
I've been on edge constantly,

646
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,520
I get nervous just seeing police cars patrolling nearby,

647
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,250
afraid they'll raid the place.

648
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,760
Xiaoman just gave birth,

649
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,690
and Sister Zhang is due next month.

650
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,440
Xiaoman even referred her friend to us,

651
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,920
who's already booked her flight.

652
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,159
They trust me so much,

653
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,360
how could I let anything happen to them?

654
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,679
Ma Xiaoyun really doesn't think about others,

655
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,409
she's so selfish and immature.

656
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,040
Right, too selfish.

657
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,040
I've never dealt with such a frustrating situation.

658
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
I really want to kick her out.

659
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,360
But kicking her out would put you in a difficult position.

660
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,199
I can't make things difficult for anyone else,

661
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,800
so I can only make things difficult for myself.

662
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Another bottle.

663
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,090
Stop drinking, you've had enough.

664
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,810
Mind your own business.

665
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,440
You still like her.

666
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Otherwise, with such an impossible personality,

667
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,440
how could you stand her?

668
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
I don't like her.

669
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,920
I swear I...

670
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
I don't like her anymore.

671
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,740
I'm not defending her.

672
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,260
Ma Xiaoyun's personality actually has a reason behind it.

673
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,240
She has a brother she never met.

674
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,880
When she was six,

675
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,840
her brother went swimming with classmates,

676
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
and drowned.

677
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Her parents had her afterwards,

678
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
and they spoiled her completely,

679
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
which is why she turned out this way.

680
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,240
But she's married now,

681
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,800
she's someone else's wife.

682
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,000
I just...

683
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,960
Ma Xiaoyun,

684
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
she got married right after college,

685
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,360
she's never had a job,

686
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,960
no social experience whatsoever, she just...

687
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,040
Anyway, I just hope that now she's had a baby,

688
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,840
becoming a mother will help her mature a bit,

689
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,040
and be more sensible.

690
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,600
Surprising,

691
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,530
you look so rough around the edges,

692
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,210
but you've got a kind heart.

693
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,400
Me? Well...

694
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,880
Apart from that,

695
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,800
there's not much else about me

696
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,200
worth praising.

697
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,240
What happened to your leg?

698
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,040
It's nothing,

699
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,800
I just pulled a muscle

700
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,400
when I was running after you.

701
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,600
Open up!

702
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,240
Open the door!

703
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,520
Hey,

704
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,280
what were you about to do?

705
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,400
Nothing at all.

706
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,610
You were clearly about to kiss her.

707
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,200
She had something on her face,

708
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,060
I was just helping her wipe it off.

709
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,840
I saw it with my own eyes and you're still lying.

710
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,320
Do you know what she does for a living?

711
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,400
She runs a postpartum care center,

712
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,860
how could you stoop so low?

713
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
Say that again if you dare.

714
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
What's wrong with running a postpartum center?

715
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,480
Does that mean I'm not qualified

716
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,600
to kiss a man?

717
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,320
What relationship do you two have that gives you the right to kiss?

718
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,720
Since when do you need a relationship to kiss?

719
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,880
I kiss whoever I want.

720
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,300
You're shameless!

721
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,800
You crazy woman!

722
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
You can rest completely assured,

723
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,320
I would never take your used goods.

724
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,840
Used goods? Used goods?

725
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,920
How did I become used goods?

726
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,120
Keke, how am I used goods?

727
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,120
You,

728
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,600
explain yourself to me.

729
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm already 'used goods',

730
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,560
what is there to explain to you?

731
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,410
Xiang Nongchao!

732
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,640
Xiang Nongchao!

733
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,440
Hello.

734
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,080
Just a moment.

735
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,280
Hello, welcome.

736
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,080
Wait,

737
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,160
let me guess,

738
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,840
you're Japanese.

739
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,000
No, Korean.

740
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm Chinese.

741
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,280
Chinese, huh? I can never tell you all apart.

742
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,600
It's fine.

743
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Okay, how can I help you?

744
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,560
I saw this yesterday,

745
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,290
and I wanted to make sure I came to the right place.

746
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,480
The flyer.

747
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,240
What do you think?

748
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,400
Looks good, right? I designed it myself.

749
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
Really, I'm impressed.

750
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,400
Thank you.

751
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,560
My name is Kevin.

752
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Welcome to AA,

753
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,980
this is the Power of Heart.

754
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,760
By the way, what's your name?

755
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,800
Looks like someone wants to remain anonymous.

756
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,040
My name is Jade Emperor.

757
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,320
God,

758
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,960
grant me the serenity

759
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,640
to accept the things I cannot change,

760
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,960
courage to change the things I can,

761
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,760
and wisdom

762
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,760
to know the difference.

763
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,640
Well then.

764
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,920
Before we begin,

765
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,160
I'd like to introduce our new member,

766
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,240
Jade Emperor.

767
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,960
Please stand up and introduce yourself.

768
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,440
Is this necessary?

769
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,240
Yes, very necessary.

770
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,440
Hello everyone, I'm Jade Emperor, Chinese.

771
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,880
Hello, Jade Emperor.

772
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,800
This is my first time at AA.

773
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,160
Nice to meet you all.

774
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,960
I...

775
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,680
I'm sorry.

776
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,320
Excuse me, is this Alcoholics Anonymous?

777
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,440
Yes, it is,

778
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,040
and you're late.

779
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,170
I'm sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.

780
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
It is difficult to park around here,

781
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,240
don't be late next time.

782
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,320
Okay.

783
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,680
Please.

784
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,480
No, no, please continue.

785
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,200
I'm done.

786
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,920
You barely said anything,

787
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,280
but that's okay.

788
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,520
First-timers are always like this,

789
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,160
take your time.

790
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,240
And what about this late lady?

791
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
Please introduce yourself too.

792
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,560
All right.

793
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,920
Hello everyone, my name is

794
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,640
Queen Mother of the West.

795
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,560
