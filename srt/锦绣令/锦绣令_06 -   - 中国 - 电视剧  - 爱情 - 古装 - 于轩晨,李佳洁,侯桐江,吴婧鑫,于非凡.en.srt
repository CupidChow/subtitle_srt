18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
Mr. Song.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
Miss Yu, where are you going?

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,440
The moonlight is beautiful.

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm coming out to admire the moon.

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,400
But it's overcast today.

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
There's no moon.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Mr. Song, let's talk inside.

25
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,720
Mr. Song, what brings you here?

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,480
I have something for you.

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,640
You've given me so many gifts.

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,920
I don't need anything

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,600
anymore.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,560
This isn't a gift.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,840
It's...

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Wan.

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,720
Look what I brought you.

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,760
Wan.

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,960
Madam.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,280
Look.

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,320
I brought you some dresses.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,480
Try them on.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,760
Madam, these dresses are obviously

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
made of premium fabric.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,200
How about I try them on

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760
after my bath tomorrow?

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,040
Don't bother.

44
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,600
Try them now.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,760
Madam, I'm rather tired today.

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
Let me try them tomorrow.

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,360
I'll leave them in the wardrobe.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Take your time tomorrow.

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,280
What's wrong?

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
I had something cold for dinner.

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,920
My belly hurts.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Get up.

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,440
Should I bring you some medicine?

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,560
No need. I'll just rest early.

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,520
We're family. Don't be shy.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,320
Once you marry Qiming,

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,280
everything in Shili Pavilion
will be yours.

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
Rest early.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,320
You've been so cheerful since you left

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
Miss Yu's room.

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,680
Did something happen?

62
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,480
Nothing much.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Pass on my words.

64
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Start preparing

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
for Qiming and Miss Yu's
wedding tomorrow.

66
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
Are you saying that

67
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,320
Young Master was in Miss Yu's room?

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
Your mother hasn't gone far. Be careful.

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
W-What were you about to say earlier?

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
I have something for you.

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
This is...?

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,640
The front gate is guarded.

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,960
And the back gate is locked.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,640
This is the key.

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
My mother will go to bed in two hours.

76
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,920
You can leave
through the back gate then.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
Mr. Song.

78
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,160
Why are you letting me go?

79
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,880
The truth is, I can tell that

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,480
although you bicker with the City Lord,

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,480
you still care for him.

82
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,400
And he's pretending to dislike you.

83
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,560
No matter how much I adore you,

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,600
I can't force you

85
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
to do things against your will.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
Mr. Song.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,160
You won't force me to marry you?

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,280
If your heart belongs to another,

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,520
what's the point

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,760
even if you marry me?

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,560
Marriage

92
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,840
should be between willing hearts.

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,080
Forced marriage brings no happiness.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,840
Mr. Song.

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you.

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Miss Yu.

97
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,064
(Shili Pavilion)

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,560
Where did you get the key?

99
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,760
Do you think silence hides the truth?

100
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,720
How dare you

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
steal the key from my room?

102
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,320
I didn't steal anything.

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,880
This is our home.
I simply took the key from you.

104
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,400
Don't talk back at me.

105
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
I worked hard to find you a wife,

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,960
but you're letting her go?

107
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,040
What a great son.

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,720
Madam, I made Mr. Song do this.

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
Don't blame him.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
I know my son very well.

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,280
Don't bother covering for him.

112
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
If it happens again,

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
I'll break your legs.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,440
Mother.

115
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
I've always obeyed you.

116
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,800
This time, let me decide.

117
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Let you decide?

118
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,400
On what?

119
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
You locked up Miss Yu

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,080
without even asking my opinion

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
and forced her to marry me.

122
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Do you care about my feelings?

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,760
I've worked tirelessly for you.

124
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
But you don't appreciate it at all.

125
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,440
You've grown some guts

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,400
to defy your own mother?

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Actually, I wanted to leave...

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
It's not your turn to speak yet.

129
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,480
You've disappointed me time and again.

130
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,960
I've lost all patience with you.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Jinchai, bring the baton.

132
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,560
Madam.

133
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,960
I wasn't escaping.

134
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,080
I was going to divorce the City Lord.

135
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
Please give me four hours.

136
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,520
Tonight,

137
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll return as a single woman.

138
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
If I fail to do so,

139
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,520
feel free to punish me.

140
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,960
Do you confess?

141
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,440
Grandfather.

142
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,320
What did I do wrong?

143
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
You still won't confess?

144
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,040
Fine, I'll beat you until you apologize.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,920
Grandfather.

146
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,240
Do you wish to
beat your grandson to death?

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,640
What a disgrace to the family.

148
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,080
It's precisely your fickle affections

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,680
that drove Wan away.

150
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,560
You've broken her heart.

151
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,560
Grandfather, I went to find her.

152
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,160
She chose to stay at Shili Pavilion.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
How dare you make excuses?

154
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,280
Yunhao, what are you doing?

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,720
Want a beating too?

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,680
Please calm down.

157
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,120
Yunqing is City Lord.

158
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
He mustn't be hurt.

159
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,520
Think about the citizens.

160
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,600
Look at your elder brother.

161
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
Now look at yourself.

162
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,360
I should have died with your parents,

163
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
so that I don't have to
see you like this.

164
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Grandfather.

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Come on.

166
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,720
Don't be mad.

167
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,240
It sounds so lively in here.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
Lord Duan,

169
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
did you come here

170
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,960
to announce His Majesty's decree?

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
His Majesty is deeply concerned,

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,840
fearing that some City Lords
might commit treason.

173
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
Don't worry, Lord Mu.

174
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm merely here to observe

175
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
which City Lords prove truly capable.

176
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,840
The City Lord's Token

177
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,120
can prove that you have no connection
to the Mobei barbarians.

178
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
My lord.

179
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
I bet you have

180
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,840
the City Lord's Token at home, right?

181
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,680
Just a minute, Your Excellency.

182
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,040
Let me fetch it.

183
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,440
Stop. Let me tag along.

184
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,080
I hate to trouble you.

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,120
You keep stalling it.

186
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,080
Is your City Lord's Token

187
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,200
somewhere else?

188
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,040
There is no such thing.

189
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,480
