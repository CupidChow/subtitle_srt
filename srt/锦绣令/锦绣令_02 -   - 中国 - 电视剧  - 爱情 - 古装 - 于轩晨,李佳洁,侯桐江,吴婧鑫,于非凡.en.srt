18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,000
This is a Mobei assassin group's totem.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
What's your connection to Mobei?

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,680
What are you scheming?

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
I happened to see it.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
Just curious about it.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Are you trying to police my curiosity?

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
If you keep lying,

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll have to kick you out of my mansion.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
What totem did you mention earlier?

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,560
I've never seen it.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
Why don't you draw it for me?

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Mu Yunqing.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
Let go of me!

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,280
We've not consummated our marriage yet.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,880
I can still send you back home in time.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
Or I can divorce you right now.

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,840
Choose one.

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,600
Two options.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,720
What if I reject both?

37
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
What scheme brings you here?

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
My scheme is about you.

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,320
I covet your beauty.

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,400
I cherish your tenderness.

41
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,560
I even fantasize about your love.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm warning you.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,160
If you plot anything,

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,960
don't blame me for turning ruthless.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,120
Childhood sweethearts?

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
It's all lies!

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
I'll stubbornly stay in this mansion,

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
making you loathe me day and night,

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
yet unable to drive me away.

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,520
Bring me the good wine.

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,192
It's run out.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,040
You drank it all.

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,240
If you don't fetch it,
I'll get it myself.

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,760
My lady.

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,632
My lady!

56
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:34,600
Calm down!

57
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:36,600
Calm down.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm not calm!

59
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,560
Maybe I should just jump down here.

60
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,320
This life is unbearable!

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,440
I might as well jump...

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me just jump and end it.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,560
I was already at the gate...

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,528
Listen to me.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,720
He's at the Flower House.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Flower House?

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,120
Help me up.

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,360
Where's the Flower House?

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,320
The eastern part of the city.

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,584
There?

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,088
Go.

72
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:07,520
(Flower House)

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,720
It's getting late.

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,519
A night like this
is too precious to waste.

75
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
Why not do something interesting

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
to spend it?

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,600
I've heard many Mobei merchants

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,040
enjoy listening
to your Ballad of the Desert.

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
Are you from Mobei as well?

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,240
You must be kidding.

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,480
Someone of my status

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
needs unique talents

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,120
to make those Mobei merchants

84
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,840
spend willingly on me.

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
Didn't you also spend
extravagantly for me,

86
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,280
my lord?

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,160
Miss Luo,

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,760
(Holding Wine Against the Wind)
if you remember my generosity,

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,280
refuse those Mobei merchants

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
and accompany only me from now on.

91
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
The night is long.

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
Let's go to bed early.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
(Continuing will alert her.)

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,320
(Better retreat for now.)

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
No need.

96
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,768
I should leave.

97
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,488
(City Lord's Mansion)

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Catch me! Here!

99
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm here!

100
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:43,920
Here!

101
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
I caught you!

102
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,200
This way!

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,400
Madam, here!

104
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,720
I caught...

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
I caught you!

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,584
What?

107
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:56,736
Who allowed you to...?

108
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,760
Are you satisfied?

109
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
Who...?

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,248
Yu Yingwan,

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,720
what's with your taste?

112
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
All of you, get out!

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,520
My taste?

114
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,520
Look at yourself and you'll understand.

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
Disgraceful!

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,664
Yu Yingwan,

117
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,520
do you realize what you're doing?

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,144
If you can visit the Flower House,

119
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,440
I can have fun too.

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,800
(Breeze, Cloud)
I'll find my own fun.

121
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:58,320
Let me go.

122

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
Am I dreaming?

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
Is it only in dreams

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,520
that you wouldn't bully me,

126
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,080
wouldn't divorce me,

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,840
wouldn't abandon me?

128

Yunqing.

129

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to.

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
You're absolutely terrible.

153
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,840
No! Last night,
you were the one who started it.

Then I...

155
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,960
Still gesturing about it?

156
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
I drank too much.

157
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,440
Why didn't you push me away?

158
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,304
Because...

159
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
I...

Because what?

161
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,728
I...

162
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
What?

163
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,320

164

(This is incense from Mobei.)

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,080
You visited the Flower House last night?

170
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,880

between us last night,

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,840
you're asking about that courtesan?

173
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,440
That's not what I meant.

174
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
I mean,

175
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
you approached Luo Shishi last night?

176
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
