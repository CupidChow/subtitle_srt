18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,720
(Wan, the way I treated you before)

19
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:59,120
(was because I didn't want
to drag you into this.)

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,840
Your wife is already dead.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,680
Hand over the City Lord Token now,

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,280
and I might spare your life.

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,639
What's the point of living as a coward?

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,760
(I've had the same dream three times.)

25
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,040
(I've tried three times,)

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,560
(but still couldn't change our fate.)

(When I was young,
an elder once told me)

(about the prophecy

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
(Never thought it'd all come true.)

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,800
(As he said,
this must be the final chance.)

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
(I wonder this time)

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,920
(if I can change the dream
and grow old with you.)

35
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:27,280
Mother.

36
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,200
Today's your death anniversary.

37
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:37,760
I miss you both so much.

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,600
I have grown up.

39
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't worry.

40
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,520
I'll never let you down.

41
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,560
I'll try my best

42
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,520
to protect Jin City's people

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
and safeguard Jin City.

44
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,200
It's been so many years.

45
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,920
Yunqing has grown up.

46
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:31,560
And he married Wan this year.

47
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:38,360
May your souls rest in peace now.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,320

Father, Mother.

52
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,000
Yunqing.

53
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,760
Your parents

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,960
were ambushed on their way back
from the capital

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,200
and both perished.

56
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,880
Your elder brother
was adopted years ago.

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
Now you must take on the responsibility
of being the City Lord.

Let the bygones be bygones.

61
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,400
Though this incident

62
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,960
started with Wan breaking the vase,

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
those who killed your parents

64
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,160
were from Mobei.

65
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,160
I know.

66
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,320
I've never blamed Wan.

67
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,760
Now Mobei grows more rampant.

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
They're our true enemy.

69
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,920
Glad that you understand this.

70
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,960
My teachings to you didn't go to waste.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,160
Wan was adopted,

72
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,800
with a tragic background.

73
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't let Wan

74
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:21,240
know about these matters.

75
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't worry, Grandfather.

76
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,280
I'll take good care of Wan.

77
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,280
Good.

78
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,960

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,904
(Shili Pavilion)

80
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Never knew you could play the flute.

81
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,840
Mother forced me to learn it.

82
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,720
She said if my sister were alive,

83
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,320
she'd master all arts and music.

84
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,760
So I had to learn them too.

85
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,320
Later,

86
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,840
my sister vanished.

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,456
After that,

88
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,768
Mother put all her hopes

89
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,240
onto me.

90
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:40,920
But I...

91
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
It's all my fault.

92
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,160
Don't think that way.

93
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Mother says Father died by Mobei hands.

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,760
And my sister vanished that same time.

95
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,640
So Mother forced me

96
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,080
to keep in mind the hatred
towards the Mobei people.

97
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,040
But I wasn't even born yet.

98
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,920
I can't fully understand her hatred.

99
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,720
I want to escape,

100
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,640
but can't leave Mother behind.

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,400
Don't think like that, Mr. Song.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Your mother loves you deeply.

103
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,080
Try talk it out with her?

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,760
You have no idea

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
that my mother has...

106
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,280
What?

107
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,280
Nothing.

108
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,600
She just wants me to be like her,

109
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,559
but I can't.

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't open your eyes yet!

111
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,120
Wan, where are you taking me?

112
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
You'll know soon.

113
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,320
Are we there yet?

114
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,520
Not yet. Hold onto me. Don't worry.

115
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
Godmother, steps ahead.

116
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,880
One, two... There!

117
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,880
Are we there?

118
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Almost there.

119
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,520
Let me help you sit down, Godmother.

120
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,960
Come over here. Sit down.

121
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,104
Why put on such a show?

122
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,760
Can I open my eyes now, Wan?

123
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,120
Yes, open your eyes.

124
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,640
W-What are these?

125
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,160
Godmother.

126
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,640
I heard Mr. Song mention

127
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,840
you had a daughter,

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,080
and she must be around my age now.

129
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,560
Godmother, my mother always said

130
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,400
a daughter is born and raised
by her mother's love.

131
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
Today, I wish to fulfill
that filial duty on her behalf.

132
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,440
Look!

133
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
This might be
her first attempt at painting.

134
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Her very first portrait was of you.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,960
In her mind,

136
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
her mother must be the one
she loved the most.

137
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,120
And this.

138
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,800
She bought this for you

139
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
after her adult ceremony.

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,560
And this.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,640
She made this rouge

142
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,120
for your birthday.

143
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,840
She wished for your eternal youth,

144
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
free from burdens.

145
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,560
Wan, thank you. Thank you.

146
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,760
Godmother, if you don't mind,

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
could you tell me more about her?

148
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,880
Her name was Baozhu.

149
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,120
When she was a baby,

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,920
I took her to enjoy
the lantern festival,

151
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,680
and she was so excited.

152
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
Is this pretty?

153
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
Is it pretty?

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,920
Is it pretty?

155
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:27,920
Move!

156
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,640
Move!

157
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,520
My husband!

158
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,560
My husband!

159
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,800
Hush now, don't cry.

160
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:58,920
Good girl.

161
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,840
(I was pregnant
with Qiming at the time,)

162
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
(so I had to leave Baozhu in the alley.)

163
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,520
(Who'd know that farewell
would be permanent?)

164
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,640
Baozhu's loss has been

165
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,280
the heaviest burden in my mind.

166
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,000
I searched for her,

167
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,680
but it was like finding
a needle in the ocean.

168
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
I found no trace.

169
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,960
My husband served as deputy general

170
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,720
to Mu Yunqing's father.

171
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,680
He was fatally poisoned,

172
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,400
beyond saving.

173
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
After giving birth to Qiming,

174
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:03,080
I never stopped
searching for my daughter.

175
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,120
Years had passed,

176
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,160
so I had no choice but
to leave with Qiming.

177
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,160
If I hadn't lost Baozhu,

178
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,920
I wouldn't be having
such a hard time now.

179
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,880
It's all my fault.

180
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
It was my fault.

181
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Godmother.

182
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,840
She must stay alive.

183
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
You must believe that.

184
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,960
And now,

185
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,560
you have me.

186
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,240
I will take good care of you for Baozhu.

187
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,840
