Wan.

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
I caught this fish for you

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
and made this soup

just for you.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,160
I raised this chicken

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,000
and made this stew

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,480
just for you.

Moreover,

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,520
Miss Yu's preferences might

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
change.

when she moves.

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,440
You are cheating!

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,200
You just can't out-argue me.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
I don't need to.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's see what she prefers.

44
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:40,544

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,640
Why won't you leave me alone?

So many tables available.

I'll take Wan home for a proper meal.

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,240
Indeed.

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,400
I'll prepare a feast
at Shili Pavilion today

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,480
to celebrate

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
the one-week anniversary
of Miss Yu's shop's opening.

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,400
She dislikes the feast.

67
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,640
She only enjoys

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,680
having meals with me.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,440
You make a valid point.

70

Song Qiming, tell me.

74
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Why do you fancy my wife?

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,440
You're already divorced.

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
This concerns Miss Yu's reputation.

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
Mind your words, City Lord.

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,760
If I must pinpoint when it started,

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,280
I think it was

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
the moment she appeared beside me.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
You're just lusting after her beauty.

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Don't you like her beauty?

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
We two

84
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
grew up together.

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
We like being with each other
and attract by each other.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,480
Not as shallow as you.

87
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,040

88
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:09,280
Enough! I don't bother arguing with you.

89
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
Just do what we should.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,480
You deserve it.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Song Qiming,

92
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,360
I have matters to attend to.

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,520
I'll take my leave.

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
Go back to rest early.

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,160
Wait.

96
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
I heard on the opening day,

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
Miss Yu was harassed

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,520
and you saved her.

99
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,880
I naturally

100
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
protect my wife.

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,280
Teach me swordsmanship.

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,880
Then when you're absent,

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
I can protect Miss Yu.

104
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,120
Teach you?

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Why would I?

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,440
Wait!

107
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Sir, please pay for the tea.

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,600
He... I...

109
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,800
Thank you.

110
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
You turn. Catch the sword!

111
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,280
What did you teach him?

112
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,880
Chest out, stomach in.

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,080
Your rear.

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,560
Hold the sword higher. Keep it steady!

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,320
City Lord,

116
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:36,800
how much longer do I have to practice?

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,240
My arms are getting tired.

118
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,120
Didn't you want to protect Wan?

119
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,920
That requires lots of effort.

120
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,000
But I really can't hold on.

121
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,120
No, no.

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
I can never master this.

(City Lord's Mansion)

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Confirmed it?

125
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,760
At the Flower House,

126
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,280
I got into her room

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
to deliver your gifts.

128
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,160
But she seemed to notice it,

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,160
and the fragrance has gone.

130
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,840
Something's suspicious.

131
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,640
My efforts to approach her
didn't go in vain.

132
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,440
Perhaps this fragrance
is our breakthrough.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,600
City Lord.

134
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,880
I have an idea.

135
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,920
Say it.

136
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
We might as well arrest her

137
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,360
and interrogate her.

138
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,640
Don't rush.

139
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
There must be someone behind her.

140
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,600
What should we do next?

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
Just wait

142
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
patiently.

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,640
Liu Bingmo, what's wrong with you?

145
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Didn't practice for long?

146
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
I did it on purpose.

147
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Watch me.

148
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,600
Mr. Song, you are amazing!

149
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,640
High five! Amazing!

150
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,320
Thank you.

151
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,280
Let me try too.

152
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,464
Wow!

153
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,840
City Lord, amazing!

154
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,880
My grandfather

155
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,520
taught me my pitch-pot throwing.

156
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,520
What's there to be pride of?

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,720
Watch me.

158
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:10,040
Impressive!

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,880
Grandfather also taught me
my pitch-pot throwing.

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Why were you so thrilled when he hit it?

161
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,640
But you're so cold to me.

162
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
You know the martial arts.

163
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,920
It's normal that you hit it.

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,320
Today is Mr. Song's birthday.

165
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,880
Why are you being jealous here?

166
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,760
City Lord has to protect the people.

167
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,320
My success earlier was just luck.

168
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm flattered.

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,160
Don't be modest, Mr. Song.

170
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,080
I quite envy you

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
for living freely and unrestrained.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
Forgive me.

173
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,040
Let us all wish Mr. Song

174
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
a happy birthday today!

175
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,440

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,640
Really?

Yunqing.

181
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,720
What's wrong?

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,560
Nothing.

183
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Wan, look!

184
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,520
How beautiful Mr. Song's mansion is!

185
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,680
I heard you excel at chess.

186
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
I wonder if we can

187
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,840
have a game of chess.

188
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,040
Not really.

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,080
Come on.

190
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,640
Then let's begin.

191
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
Black goes first.

192
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,560
I can tell

193
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,000
you care deeply for my lady.

194
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,600
She's a fair lady, after all.

195
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,040
You come from a prominent family,

196
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,760
and possess such elegance.

197
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,080
Many ladies must

198
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,680
wish to marry you.

199
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,080
I am loyal only to Miss Yu.

200
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,640
I'll go check

201
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,120
if they want

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
some pastries.

203
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
Finish the game first.

204
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
Your move, Mr. Song.

205
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,200
Please.

206
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
With this move,

207
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,720
I might win.

208
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,880
Not really.

209
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,440
Absolutely.

210
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
Not really.

211
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,000
I win.

212
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,800
Wei Feng...

213
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,600
Mr. Song, you didn't win.

214
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,400
I... You...

215
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,280
Look at him!

216
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,040
Mr. Song.

217
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Another game!

218
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,560
I really envy Mr. Song.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
After my parents died,

220
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,640
I was forced to be the City Lord.

221
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,040
From that moment on,

222
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,840
I had to be a good City Lord,

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,520
protect my people,

224
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,920
and defend against
the invasions from Mobei.

225
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,080
I was not even ten years old then.

226
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,280
I often doubted myself

227
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,880
if I could handle all this.

228
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:58,640
