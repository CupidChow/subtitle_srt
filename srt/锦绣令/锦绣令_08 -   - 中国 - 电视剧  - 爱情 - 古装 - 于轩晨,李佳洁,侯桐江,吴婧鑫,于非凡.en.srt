18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,880
Madam, the City Lord
stayed outside all night.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,680
He's still there.

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,840
If he insists on staying,

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,920
let him be.

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,120
Let me see. Isn't it beautiful?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,360
Qiming, what are you doing?

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
Forgive me.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,039
Mother,

26
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,760
please stop forcing Miss Yu to marry me.

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,280
Miss Yu didn't ask me to say this.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
It has nothing to do with her.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,600
This is my own decision.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
I've always given you

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,440
everything you wanted.

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Have I ever failed you?

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,280
You won't marry the girl you love.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
What do you want?

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,440
Mother, ever since
my sister went missing,

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,920
you've been seeking

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,320
her reflection through me.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
You've always offered me the best,

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
and you do love me.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
But your love weighs on me.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,640
I can't bear it.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
You've piled the love

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
for my sister onto me as well.

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,240
You want me to be filial, considerate,

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
obedient, and sensible.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
But have you ever

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,240
considered what I truly desire?

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,840
You've never had an opinion.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
When did you ever want something?

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,320
Mother, I'm grateful you raised me.

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,840
But I don't want

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,760
to rush into marriage so blindly.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,000
Miss Yu doesn't love me.

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
So, I can't marry her.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,200
If one day

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,520
she says she loves me

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,320
and wants to marry me,

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,600
that will be the time

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,360
for us to get married.

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,720
You...

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,240
Qiming, you've matured.

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240
I will do as you say.

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,200
Since Qiming won't pressure you,

64
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,040
forget about the wedding.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,640
In the end, I'm not meant to be
your mother-in-law.

66
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,120
Madam.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
May I ask you

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
for something?

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
What are you doing?

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,640
I met Mr. Song too late

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
and I need more time to know him.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
But if you don't disdain me,

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
will you be my godmother first?

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
If you don't answer,

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll take it as a yes.

76
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,520
You...

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,200
Fine.

78
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,520
Cone on. Get up.

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Is that a yes?

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,640
From now on, I'll call you Godmother.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,680
Godmother, please sit.

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,080
Let me massage your shoulders.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,080
Don't be like this.

84
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,800
We're like family.

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Godmother, how's the pressure?

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Wan.

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
Since you've divorced the City Lord,

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
stay here at Shili Pavilion

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,520
if you don't wish to go back
to your home.

90
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Alright, Godmother.

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
Godmother.

92
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,160
Actually, there's
one more thing I must do.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Thank you.

94
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,840
(Recruitment)
Welcome

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,640
to the unprecedented,

96
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,560
utterly unique,

97
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
and unmatched

98
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Yu's Courier
for delivery and errand services.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,280
Liu Bingmo.

100
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,080
Coming.

101
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,560
(Yu's Courier)
It's our first day in business.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,800
Let's work together from now on,

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
grow stronger, and achieve new glory.

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
We have a bright future.

105
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,400
Are you confident?

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
- Yes!
- Yes!

107
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,280
My lord.

108
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,040
What's wrong?

109
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,000
My lord.

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Madam didn't marry Mr. Song.

111
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
What did you say?

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,520
She didn't marry him.

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
She's at West Street.

114
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Will you go see her?

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,200
She didn't marry him.

116
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Wan.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
Move aside.

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,960
Make way.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Make way.

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
Look who we have here.

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,800
The City Lord's wife

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,960
started a business, huh?

123
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
I've already divorced

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,040
the City Lord.

125
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
Remember my name.

126
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,792
I'm the owner of Yu's Courier,

127
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,720
Yu Yingwan.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,080
You divorced the City Lord

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,120
and came to

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,480
compete with common folk like us?

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
You're just a woman.

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,920
Can you even run a business?

133
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah, can you?

134
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,080
Want trouble?

135
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,400
Liu Bingmo.

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
Whether I can run a business

137
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
isn't for you to question.

138
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
That's enough. Get lost.

139
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,120
Don't mess with my business.

140
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,320
Yeah, get lost.

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,280
You want a fight?

142
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,040
Say that again.

143
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Take it easy.

144
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,200
You're a woman.

145
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,240
Marry someone

146
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,480
and have children.

147
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,080
Stop showing up

148
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,000
in public, right?

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,960
You only care about

150
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,920
marrying someone and having children.

151
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
What are you

152
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,040
doing for yourself?

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
No wonder people say you're ill-mannered

154
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
and got dumped.

155
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,080
You're so sharp-tongued.

156
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,880
Men don't like you.

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Exactly.

158
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Many people appreciate

159
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,280
this sharp tongue of mine.

160
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,920
Besides,

161
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,880
I don't need men's approval to live.

162
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm living life on my own terms.

163
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
And remember.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,920
I chose to divorce the City Lord.

165
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,080
I dumped Mu Yunqing.

166
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Y-You...

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
You brought ill fate to your in-laws.

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,720
Nobody wants you.

169
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
I'll count to three.

170
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Get lost or I'll get the authorities.

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:31,960
You...

172
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,720
What are you doing? Open up.

173
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Open up. It's not City Lord's Mansion.

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,040
My lady.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,960
My lord.

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
We're divorced.

177
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Why did you come to my shop?

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
Didn't you marry Song Qiming?

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,800
Why are you here?

180
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,760
I...

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
I changed my mind.

182
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,520
Why should I tell you?

183
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
Song Qiming isn't the one for you.
Let's go home.

184
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,040
No.

185
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,320
Lord Mu.

186
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm not going back with you.

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,960
Things are perfect at Shili Pavilion.

188
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,160
Besides, we're divorced.

189
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,880
I can't go back with you.

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
We're not divorced.

191
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,520
Lord Mu,

192
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,600
I don't love you anymore.

193
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Please leave.

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,680
Let me go.

195
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Calmer now?

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,760
If you don't let go,

197
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
I'll call for help.

198
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,920
You scoundrel.

199
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,920
Wan, I made a mistake.

200
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
When this is over,

201
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,840
I'll explain everything.

202
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
Every word is sincere, I swear.

203
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
Trust me.

204
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,360
I can't live without you.

205
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,440
Then tell me.

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
What's your deal with Luo Shishi?

207
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
I did try to approach her.

208
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,560
(This is incense from Mobei.)

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,680
Miss Luo,

210
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,480
could you tell me

211
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,840
where you obtained
the incense in your room?

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
But I did that for a reason.

213
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,760
Trust me.

214
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
How can I trust you?

215
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
(Code of Male Virtues)
Code of Male Virtues.

216
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,200
A husband...

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Keep it down. Don't read out loud.

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,720
A husband should uphold moral virtue.

219
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,160
Always please your wife.

220
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,680
Be punished if you cheat.

221
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,720
Alright, from now on,

222
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,280
I won't let you off

223
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,800
if you break even one

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,880
of these rules.

225
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
Come home with me tonight.

226
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
That depends on my mood.

227
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,280
Wan, you're back.

228
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm just grabbing some clothes.

229
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,600
Wan, I have a gift for you.

230
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,320
What is it?

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
A lotus emerges pure from clear waters,
unadorned by artifice.

232
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,920
This hairpin suits you perfectly.

233
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
It's just a hairpin.

234
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,360
What's so special about it?

235
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,400
So pretty.

236
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you done?

237
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
May I leave now?

238
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,040
Wan, come back home, please.

239
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,320
I promise

240
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,360
I won't treat you like before.

241
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,240
Really?

242
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
The person

243
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,480
who abducted me
left me at Shili Pavilion

244
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
for Madam Hong to keep me there.

245
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
I must find out who this person is.

246
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't worry.

247
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,400
I'll look into it.

248
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I can investigate too.

249
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
After all, I have
certain advantages you don't.

250
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,120
Wan.

251
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,480
Stop investigating

252
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,160
that totem, okay?

253
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm going back there.

254
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,640
Can't you stay?

255
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Not today. We'll talk tomorrow.

256
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,640

change everything this time?)
