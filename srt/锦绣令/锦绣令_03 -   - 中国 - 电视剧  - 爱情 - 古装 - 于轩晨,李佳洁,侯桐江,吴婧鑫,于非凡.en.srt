He doesn't love me.

Wait.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,672
My lady.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,704
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,888
I brought you wine.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,440
- You two, put the wine over there.
- Yes.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Premium osmanthus wine. Try it.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
(I vaguely remember basking
in his affection in my dreams.)

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,560
(Only then could I drink freely.)

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,392
Wan.

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,656
What are you doing?

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,792
I'm planting flowers.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
Why did you buy so much wine?

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Because I know you enjoy drinking.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
From today onward,

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,520
I will never drink another drop of wine.

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,480
Who is your inside informant?

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,200
Do you think I can't find out
just because you won't tell me?

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Go ahead and investigate.

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,320
Even if I die,

42
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,680
I'll never tell you
who the informant is.

43
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,280
Wei Feng, release him.

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,000
My lord, we finally caught one.

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,040
Releasing him will waste our efforts.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,760
I said it. Release him.

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,120
If your accomplices

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,840
see you safely released,

49
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:01,440
what fate awaits you?

50
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
You should know better than I do.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,272
You...

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Still not telling me?

53
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
I only seek

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
to die honorably for Mobei.

55
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,360
Wei Feng, watch him.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,760
Throw him out in a few days.

57
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Yes.

58
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,560
Mu Yunqing!

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,840
Just kill me!

60
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Mu Yunqing!

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,800
Will you really throw the assassin out?

62
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,864
No more interrogations?

63
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,200
Look at him.

64
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,960
Does he look like
he'll give us anything?

65
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Those Mobei assassins were too bold.

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
Attempting to kill you
on your wedding day.

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,520
An inside job.

68
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,120
They're overreaching.

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,200
The Madam was investigating
before the assassins came.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Could she know something?

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
Watch Liu Bingmo closely.

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Find out what they're really planning.

73
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:00,600
Yes.

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,000
Things are getting tense.

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,440
Every city has those coveting my token.

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,920
We must plan ahead.

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
What do you plan to do?

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,680
Spread the word
that the assassin has confessed

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,200
and will be released soon.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,896
Yes.

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,080
I'll make them know

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Jin City is not theirs to touch.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
Neither is the Central Plains.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,176
Who?

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,336
Let's go.

86
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,520
(Shili Pavilion)
Mr. Song, drink with us.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,680
Madam Hong let us teach you how to talk

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,360
(Song Qiming, Madam Hong's son)
to girls.

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,840
Don't be shy now.

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,240
Lady,

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
maintain boundaries.

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,840
Please show restraint.

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,440
Mr. Song.

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,040
- Okay.
- This is your home.

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,664
Take it easy.

96
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
Drink up.

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,560
Sir, drink.

98
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,392
Go on, drink.

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,320
I really can't drink anymore, ladies.

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,176
Miss.

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
Miss.

102
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,320
(Why do I feel so close to this lady)

103
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,240
(the first time we meet?)

104
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
You were so shy earlier,

105
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,520
but now, you're embracing another girl.

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
- I...
- Mr. Song.

107
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Seems you don't need any teaching.

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
Let's go.

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
S-S-Safe travels.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,440
Ladies,

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,240
next time my mother summons you,

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,680
please don't come!

113
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,784
Miss.

114
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
Miss.

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,888
Miss.

116
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,032
Yu Yingwan.

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,528
Sir,

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,728
the woman beside you is my wife.

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm taking her back now.

120
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,560
Wait! Stop!

121
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
How can you prove she's your wife?

122
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:11,720
Look, I got it.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,608
Brilliant.

124
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
Wan, are you alright?

125
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:21,960
You're bleeding.

126
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,520
There's a wound on her neck.

127
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
You are lying.

128
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,000
Her neck bears no scar whatsoever.

129
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,720
(How could this be?)

130
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,464
(Could it be...?)

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,320
That man abandoned
her here without explanation.

132
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,640
What if you want to harm her?

133
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,240
What if that man was trying to save her?

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,360
If I give her to you,
wouldn't I be an accomplice?

135
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,208
How about this?

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,840
When this young lady
awakens tomorrow morning,

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
I'll escort her

138
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,160
wherever she wants to go.

139
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,440
You may leave now.

140
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,680
No.

141
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,120
My lord, this is the Shili Pavilion.

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,200
Madam Hong is renowned for her virtue.

143
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,360
Moreover, the mansion
isn't secure tonight.

144
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,360
Let's return

145
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,880
and let the Madam sleep here peacefully.

146
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
We'll come get her tomorrow.

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,704
Mr. Song.

148
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,520
I know your family

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,560
is a prominent merchant family.

150
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
You're a gentleman.

151
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,640
I trust you will

152
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,360
take good care of my wife tonight.

153
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
We shall take our leave now.

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
If any harm befalls my wife,

155
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,680
you know the consequences.

156
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,368
Miss.

157
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,344
What is this?

158
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,616
(Keep Miss Yu at your mansion.)

159
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Found the poisoning source?

160
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,640
The autopsy is pending.

161
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
We'll report to you immediately.

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,984
Red sores.

163
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,680
I've never seen this type of poison.

164
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,920
Everyone who entered the prison today

165
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,360
has been questioned.

166
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,920
No irregularities.

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,640
Identify this poison without fail.

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,592
My lord.

169
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,160
This must be the work of that Mobei spy.

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Shall we dig deeper?

171
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,440
It was done so secretly.

172
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,760
The perpetrator knows my mansion well.

173
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:07,720
They're hidden,

174
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,640
but we're exposed.

175
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,600
Don't alert the enemy.

176
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,360
But we can't stay idle.

177
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,760
Look into the Yunluo Incense

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,080
and then the mole.

179
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes.

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,160
