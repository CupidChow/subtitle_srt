(I must do something.)

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Mother.

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Where are you going?

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,720
Nowhere.

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,640
Nowhere?

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,680
You think I don't know

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
what's on your mind?

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
Are you going to free Miss Yu?

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,600
Mother.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,720
How do you know?

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
You're my son.

30
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,760
Every move of yours

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
tells me what you're up to.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,560
Nothing escapes me.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,040
Mother.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,080
Please let go of Miss Yu.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
I promised the City Lord

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,640
to send her back safe and sound.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
But you even

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,960
locked him up.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,560
Your arm stopped hurting?

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,760
And you're playing the saint now?

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Mother.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
Who told you to lock up Miss Yu?

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
That person is up to no good.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,080
It's not something

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,040
for you to ask about.

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,160
And you're not going anywhere.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
Stay in your room.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
(Shili Pavilion)

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Stop struggling. It's pointless.

50
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
If it weren't for you,

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
I wouldn't be suffering
such humiliation here.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,360
You find it funny?

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,920
You remind me of our childhood days.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
Back then,

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,080
you didn't despise me like you do now.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,680
Naughty boy.

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Don't you dare get up

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
without permission.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,280
Yunqing, this is all my fault.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,760
I broke that thing by mistake.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,720
I should be the one punished.

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,480
Don't cry, Wan.

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
But you took the lashing.

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,640
You could die.

65
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm just hurt.

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
I won't die.

67
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,240
If I'd known

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,360
you'd fall for
another man so easily now,

69
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,640
I shouldn't have
covered for you back then.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
Mu Yunqing, why do you care who I like

71
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,480
if you don't want me?

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,320
Also,

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
why do you care to save me?

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,600
Song Qiming is not the one for you.

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm helping you out.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
So who is the right one for me?

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,320
Who?

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,400
Who is it?

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,680
You should stay single.

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,360
You...

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
In that case,

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
let's get divorced.

83
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,560
Stop dawdling.

84
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
Stop threatening me with divorce.

85
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
Forgot how you refused to leave

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,520
the City Lord's Mansion?

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,880
That's right, I refused to leave.

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,800
But I never asked you to save me.

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,920
You stopped me from

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,680
investigating...

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,640
Investigating what?

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
None of your business.

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,400
If you're truly into Song Qiming,

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,520
I'll step aside.

95
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,600
Alright.

96
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,040
I'd love for you to step aside.

97
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,480
Mr. Song is kind and handsome.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,840
And he spends on me.

99
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,800
Unlike someone else

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,920
who only makes me mad.

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
I won't live past thirty
if I stay with you.

102
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
Unreasonable.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,200
The City Lord must learn to sweet-talk.

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,120
Even City Lord

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,440
can't bully our young lady.

106
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,120
Let go.

107
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,880
Calm down.

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,520
Move aside.

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,320
Enough.

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,000
Calm down.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Our City Lord didn't mean it that way.

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,600
I admit

113
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
our City Lord has some problems.

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,360
But they finally

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,200
have a chance to talk it out.

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
If you barge in now,

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,440
how can they talk?

118
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,160
What's there to talk about?

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
You just don't care about our lady.

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
Step aside now.

121
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Step aside.

122
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
I sealed your acupoint.

123
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,920
Once they finish talking,

124
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
I'll unseal it.

125
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
What did you say?

126
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,880
Cursing me, huh?

127
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
Enough. Stop cursing me.

128
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
Let's enjoy the show first.

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,520
Enough.

130
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,240
We need to find a way out.

131
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm the City Lord of Jin City.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Madam Hong wouldn't dare harm us.

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,280
Madam Hong dotes on Mr. Song.

134
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,240
You stabbed him.

135
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
She won't show mercy.

136
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you scared of Madam Hong

137
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,920
or worried you couldn't marry Mr. Song?

138
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,280
What's wrong with you?

139
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,160
You're still obsessing over it?

140
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,120
Focus on something more important,

141
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,480
like how we're getting out.

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,880
At critical moments...

143
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm on my own.

144
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
What are you doing?

145
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
No more questions.

146
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,320
Saving you, obviously.

147
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,520
Don't be reckless.

148
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,240
There.

149
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Let me cut the ropes.

150
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
With what?

151
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
Don't cut me by mistake.

152
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,120
Shut up.

153
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,520
Yu Yingwan, be gentle.

154
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,040
Stop nagging.

155
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,240
Yu Yingwan, go easy.

156
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,200
That hurts.

157
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,560
I know.

158
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400
Keep it down.

159
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
Am I supposed to

160
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
listen to something so scandalous?

161
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,400
I can't see.

162
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,240
So I may cut you.

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,440
Stop. Come closer.

164
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,040
Keep still.

165
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,880
Hurry.

166
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
What's wrong?

167
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Are you okay?

168
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,320
I scratched my neck. Left side.

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
(Why did this happen?)

170
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,679
I'm almost reaching it.

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,760
Look, I got it.

172
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Brilliant.

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
Wan, are you alright?

174
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,520
(In the end, I couldn't prevent
what was meant to happen.)

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,760
Mu Yunqing, work with me here.

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
Once you get out,

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll be able to focus on my mission.

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
What are you up to?

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm staying here.

180
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,560
Why are you so determined to stay?

181
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,520
I have things to do.

182
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,600
Give me a few days.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,560
Once I get what I need,

184
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,760
trust me,

185
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,840
I'll go back to you.

186
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,600
Staying here will be
quite inconvenient for you.

187
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,360
It eases my mind to

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
leave this with you.

189
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:48,576
(Token)

190
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,726
Don't move, you...

191
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,960
My lord.

192
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
My lady, are you fine?

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,400
Madam. Emergency.

194
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,960
The City Lord and Miss Yu escaped.

195
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
What did you say?

196
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
To the City Lord's Mansion.

197
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,240
- Madam.
- Mother.

198
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
I'm still here.

199
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Miss Yu.

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,160
I've decided to marry Mr. Song.

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,560
I'll treat you as my own daughter.

202
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,080
(I must find the mastermind soon.)

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,080
You have such great hair.

204
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,560
When I was young,

205
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,000
I had such nice hair, too.

206
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,640
I bet you were

207
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,960
the renowned beauty across the region.

208
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,480
Spare me the flattery.

209
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm old now.

210
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,040
This world belongs to your generation.

211
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,840
I sense you mean me no harm.

212
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
Could you please tell me

213
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
who wishes me ill?

214
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
That I cannot disclose.

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,920
You could give me some hints.

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,120
Does this person covet my position

217
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,520
or the City Lord's?

218
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,640
You're really sharp, young lady.

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,440
But such tactics won't work on me.

220
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm not revealing anything to you.

221
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,840
Unless

222
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,880
you can keep Qiming happy forever.

223
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
You know very well

224
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,640
that the Mobei army repeatedly invades

225
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,760
our borders...

226
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,040
As a woman,

227
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,640
I have no grand ambitions.

228
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,960
I won't support Mu Yunqing.

229
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
Nor will I side with Mobei.

230
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,480
I just want a place for my son and me

231
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,600
to live our lives in peace.

232
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,080
If you behave and stay here,

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,160
I might tell you a few things.

234
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,720
Otherwise,

235
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
I'll hand you over to those people.

236
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,960
Let me toast you with tea

237
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,200
to welcome you into Shili Pavilion.

238
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,560
Madam, what if I change my mind?

239
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,480
Then I shall kill you.

240
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,960
Tomorrow is the fifth day
of the sixth month.

241
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
It's an auspicious day.

242
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,160
In my opinion,

243
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,480
it's time to send the divorce papers
to the City Lord's Mansion.

244
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,560
(Madam Hong is omnipotent.
I'll play along for now.)

245
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,840
(In the dream,)

246
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,560
(Eunuch Duan will come to inspect)

247
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,880
(the City Lord's Token tomorrow.)

248
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,920
(Yunqing entrusted it to me
on our wedding night.)

249
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
Mobei has long been targeting us.

250
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,880
If the villains obtain
the City Lord's Token,

251
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
they will surely collude with Mobei.

252
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,920
Because whoever possesses the token

253
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,560
becomes the legitimate City Lord

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,360
and commands Jin City's 30,000 troops.

255
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,880
Everyone

256
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,920
must obey that person without question.

257
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,080
So the token
can mobilize military forces, too?

258
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,760
That's right.

259
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,640
Will you join me

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,560
to protect the City Lord's Token

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,680
and our people?

262
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,560
Yes, I will.

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,760
(Last night, he gave me
the City Lord's Token again.)

264
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,400
(I must find a way to give it back.)
