1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,728
They betrayed me.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,528
How could you do this to your sister?

3
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:06,432
Shouldn’t come here.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,176
But you came.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,168
The only person I’ll trust

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,000
is me.

7
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:27,304
(Are sisters friends, )

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,904
(attachments, )

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,384
(or enemies given by parents?)

10
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:40,264
(Being the oldest sister is a duty, )

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,272
(a responsibility, )

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,544
From now on, do it for yourself.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,660
Don’t do things for anyone else anymore.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,888
(and a burden that’s too heavy to bear.)

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,864
(Since you don’t get to carry all these like I do, )

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,064
(then don’t you dare judge me.)

17
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,360
10 HOURS AGO

18
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:19,620
Will you stay here for long, Miss Bua?

19
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,432
Hmm…

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,464
I’m still not sure.

21
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,552
Probably until the things about the Farm

22
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,328
and Chatfah are sorted out.

23
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,296
Aunty Chom.

24
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,272
You’ve heard about what the police found

25
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:43,152
at the farm already, right?

26
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,000
I don’t quite know about the details

27
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,416
but I think that body was probably someone

28
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,980
who have been working at the farm for a long time.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,392
Probably since I was young.

30
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,776
Do you happen to know

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,936
if anyone has disappeared mysteriously before?

32
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,896
Back in the days,

33
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,216
this area was not so developed.

34
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,840
No one notices people coming or leaving.

35
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:16,536
Then what about a case?

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Say…

37
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,088
Has anyone fought with Dad

38
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,440
or Uncle Kajorn before?

39
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,056
About the past,

40
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,400
I have forgotten about them already.

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,688
Memories,

42
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,160
they tend to trick us.

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,328
Sometimes, things that we’ve always believed

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,296
might be just something in our heads

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,976
and not the truth.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,400
I’ve never asked you

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,856
how long you have been working here.

48
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:51,150
Is it even before I was born?

49
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,680
Before you were born.

50
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,576
And before Miss Pimol came in.

51
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,768
I owe a lot to Mr. Asok.

52
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,952
I promised him

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,248
to love and be loyal to Mr. Asok

54
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:15,496
and his family.

55
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:18,320
I will not let anyone

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,928
trample on what used to be Mr. Asok’s at all costs.

57
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,824
You can trust in me, Miss Bua.

58
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,808
* NO CONNECTION AS FATHER AND CHILD *
RESULTS OF DNA PATERNITY TEST

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,376
As I’ve mentioned earlier

60
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,992
about the new breed of our orchid.

61
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,456
As a result, for this semester,

62
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,460
we’re fully booked

63
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,880
by the orders from skincare companies.

64
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,704
If something happens to me,

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,112
You and your sisters won’t get off the hook either.

66
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,920
The body that they found,

67
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,080
it might not be the only secret in our family.

68
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,792
If it comes to a project under Mr. Kajorn,

69
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,152
we're resting assured.

70
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,540
Thank you so much.

71
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Uh…

72
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm not sure if I'm mistaken

73
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,568
but this project

74
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:15,304
was actually my Dad’s idea.

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,664
But without Mr. Kajorn’s ability

76
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,000
to take it to a further step,

77
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,160
then it wouldn’t have come this far.

78
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,064
Actually,

79
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:28,312
it’s not that I’m not impressed with the figures or anything.

80
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,480
But right now,

81
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,864
our pressing agenda should be

82
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:38,190
that a body was found at our farm.

83
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,580
About that, the PR department is taking care of it.

84
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,232
Since when?

85
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:45,544
I didn’t know about that.

86
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,872
Well, I sent the command

87
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:50,304
as soon as I heard about the issue.

88
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,820
But we have something more important.

89
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,312
I'd like you all to have a read of this document

90
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:03,256
and please sign the consensus.

91
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,656
To prevent misinformation

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,880
which could impact the company.
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

93
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,160
I believe we should have a mutual agreement

94
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,504
including your sisters.

95
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,048
Do you not trust us that much?

96
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,456
Judging from things I’ve seen so far,

97
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,952
the answer is

98
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,176
probably yes.

99
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,008
What you did

100
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,936
is like throwing me and my sisters under the bus

101
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,760
in front of the board of directors.

102
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,040
Let’s say that I know you guys well.

103
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:57,912
If my sister were to work here,

104
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,910
no one would take them seriously.

105
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:00,912
Wait a second,

106
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:02,168
do you really think that

107
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:04,256
our sisters would get to run this company?

108
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,296
Which one?

109
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,704
The one with her nude video being released all over the internet.

110
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,544
The one who has just disappeared.

111
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,512
Or…

112
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,104
the one who doesn’t even dare speak up to fight for herself?

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,928
Uncle Kajorn.

114
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,976
If you don’t sign it,

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,980
that’s when things would seem incredible.

116
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:27,928
You’re doing this

117
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,152
because you’re trying to nitpick us, right?

118
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,240
So that if we breach the agreement,

119
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,360
you would be able to get rid of us easily, right?

120
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,360
Then just don’t breach the agreement.

121
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,640
You’re just like what Mom said.

122
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,712
You can’t be trusted.

123
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Again.

124
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,656
“What Mom said”, again.

125
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,632
Do you think that woman

126
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,952
can really be trusted?

127
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,096
I understand.

128
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,680
All children see their parents as heroes.

129
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,968
But when you grow up,

130
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,664
you learn the truth that

131
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,760
parents aren’t heroes.

132
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,040
They’re humans just like us.

133
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,176
With a dark side

134
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,240
and a bright side.

135
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,368
Would you be able to accept it?

136
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,208
If they, too, had done something wrong.

137
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,210
If Chatfah is still gone like this,

138
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,792
I think we have to divide up the wealth again.

139
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,760
When that time comes,

140
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,864
you should stop running to your Mom and Dad, crying.

141
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,296
The body that they found,

142
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,952
it might not be the only secret in our family.

143
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,408
The well is discovered.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Do you think…

145
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,768
that you won’t be dragged into it?

146
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,544
PRESENT

147
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,540
Are you saying that

148
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,248
the body is the person you saw drowning

149
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,430
when you were young?

150
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,210
I can’t confirm it.

151
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
It’s more like a dream.

152
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,760
But at the scene of that incident,

153
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,776
there were my Dad,

154
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,096
Chatfah,

155
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,144
and Uncle Kajorn.

156
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,056
But I don’t know

157
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,600
whether Uncle Kajorn would tell me the truth

158
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,370
if I were to ask him.

159
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,056
We'd do our best in investigating, no matter what.

160
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,024
But thank you so much anyways

161
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:33,520
for providing more information.

162
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,224
But from now on,

163
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,128
I won’t come and meet you like this anymore.

164
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,080
If you have any more information

165
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,792
then I’d appreciate it if you follow the procedures.

166
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:07,768
I’m sorry

167
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,304
if I put you in a hard place.

168
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,330
But the reason why I wanted to talk to you

169
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,088
is because you’re the only one I trust.

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,472
I’m confused by so many things right now.

171
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,232
Even the person I used to trust the most

172
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:30,290
can’t seem to be trusted anymore.

173
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,904
As soon as this came to mind,

174
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,312
the first person I wanted to talk to was you.

175
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,368
I didn’t think it through.

176
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,424
We're no longer just some old friends anymore.

177
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,384
I’m sorry.

178
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,456
From now on, I won’t bother you anymore.

179
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,968
Anyways, thank you for coming to see me today.

180
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,136
2006

181
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,000
Miss Picha!

182
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:34,232
Miss Picha!

183
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,816
Mr. Asok!

184
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,008
Mr. Asok!

185
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,248
Miss Picha is having a seizure again!

186
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:39,272
Picha!

187
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,144
Miss Picha!

188
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,168
Picha!

189
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,630
What’s wrong with you, Picha?

190
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Picha.

191
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,720
Please move aside.

192
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,568
Open your mouth.

193
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,368
What are you doing?

194
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,592
She might bite her tongue.

195
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,304
What are you doing?!

196
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,880
Stop that right now.

197
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,128
Get off her!

198
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,160
Picha, my baby.

199
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:03,192
Picha!

200
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Picha!

201
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,896
Easy there, baby.

202
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:07,936
Picha.

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Picha.

204
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,672
What were you doing?

205
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,392
Are you going to let her kill our child?

206
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:19,536
Picha…

207
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Picha…

208
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,170
When our child has that symptom,

209
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,488
I don’t know what to do.

210
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,496
I’ve already spoken to the doctor.

211
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,920
They said we should just monitor her.

212
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,968
A seizure like this should be gone

213
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,600
within 2-3 minutes.

214
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,360
I also noticed that she’s getting better and better.

215
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,544
Then why were you gone for so long this time?

216
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,344
I am back, though.

217
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:52,184
This time, I will take care of the children

218
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,952
and of you too.

219
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,904
I don’t want to be sick like this.

220
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,900
I made Dad stressed.

221
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,920
Oh dear.

222
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,104
Dad has always been stressed out.

223
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,656
Hmm?

224
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,608
It’s good that he’s stressed about his child sometimes,

225
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,512
so he wouldn’t just be stressed out about work.

226
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:19,536
Sounds good?

227
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,856
I’ve brought you lots of snacks.

228
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,120
Let me get them for you.

229
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,208
The kids in America love these.

230
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,352
But…

231
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,744
Dad doesn’t allow such sweets.

232
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,728
It’s alright.

233
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:40,288
Just keep it a secret between us.

234
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:41,520
Alright?

235
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,896
Mom!

236
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,232
Mom!

237
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,328
I’ve missed you guys.

238
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:53,936
Did you guys miss me?

239
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,784
Yes!

240
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:56,864
Did you guys fight?

241
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,624
Are you sure?

242
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,448
(Hello! You’re watching Hashtag Tag Tag!)

243
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,816
(It's still an ongoing gossip, )

244
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:28,080
(for the disappearance of Chatfah, )

245
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,320
(an heiress to a famous family.)

246
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:32,464
(There’s no progress on the investigation just yet)

247
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,928
(but there are lots of things that seem shady.)

248
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:35,664
(The internet is curious)

249
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:36,904
(as to who's really behind this.)

250
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,008
(Is it the fiancé or the 3 older sisters?)

251
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,520
(But the one that’s got the highest vote from the internet)

252
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,608
(is probably the third sister.)

253
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:46,016
(Since she has just been awarded a prize)

254
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,568
(in an international jewelry award.)

255
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:50,800
(This piece would also get to be manufactured in Dubai.)

256
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:53,592
(The thing is, the sketch of this jewelry set)

257
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,736
(happens to be similar to the sketch for)

258
00:16:55,768 --> 00:16:56,688
(next season’s jewelry collection)

259
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:59,920
(by God Gem, a brand that Chatfah, her sister, )

260
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,166
(is holding the brand ambassador title.)

261
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,920
(It’s so similar that it seems like)

262
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:04,036
(the same sketch has been submitted.)

263
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,440
(Rumor has it that the prize the third sister’s company)

264
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,712
(is going to get from the competition)

265
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,272
(is over tens of millions!)

266
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,784
(So the internet is suspicious that, )

267
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,144
(just maybe, this could be the motive.)

268
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:16,140
What are you doing?

269
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,872
What are these pictures?

270
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,944
Nothing.

271
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,480
I thought

272
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,088
you liked Chatfah all along.

273
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
I used to.

274
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,776
But people

275
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,656
can always have a change of heart, right?

276
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,144
It also doesn’t mean that

277
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:49,860
you can hold this against me.

278
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,464
I’m not lenient like Nathat.

279
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,352
Don’t forget

280
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,248
that I’m

281
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,568
holding your secret.

282
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,312
And about that scissor,

283
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,864
I think you should stop searching.

284
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,080
You won’t find it.

285
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,280
Yes?

286
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:34,392
(Chompoo!)

287
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:36,504
(It’s good that you’re already up.)

288
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,168
(Can you quickly do a live streaming)

289
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,056
(to sell some clothes instead of Sarah?)

290
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,960
(I couldn’t contact her since this morning.)

291
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,728
Did you find him, Aunty Chom?

292
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:48,073
No.

293
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,488
But Dad never disappeared

294
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:50,920
without telling anyone.

295
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,032
Maybe he went out for a run.

296
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:55,168
These days, Mr. Kajorn is into running at night

297
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,928
or at dawn.

298
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,088
He says it’s not hot.

299
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:02,370
But shouldn’t he be back by now?

300
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,672
Well, if you’re worried

301
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:07,040
then I’ll help you look for him.

302
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,184
Dad likes to run in this area.

303
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:15,384
I’m afraid that he might pass out

304
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:16,728
and collapsed while he was alone.

305
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,048
Then…

306
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,608
I’ll have a look around for you.

307
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,064
Miss Pi, the press keeps calling.

308
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,160
I know.

309
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,752
The judges want to hear about our response.

310
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:10,840
They said it’s being reviewed.

311
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,088
The judges don’t want to be targeted either.

312
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:16,264
We really didn’t copy them, right?

313
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:19,072
Do you have any connections with the judges?

314
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,540
I want to have a talk with them.

315
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,528
Alright, I’ll try to get connected from our side.

316
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,776
This…

317
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,936
Someone sent it to you.

318
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,744
TO MISS PUDPICHAYA BUPPHACHINDA
PICHAGEM CO., LTD.

319
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,376
NOW YOU REALLY GET TO BE THE VICTIM.

320
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Hello?

321
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,200
Uncle Kajorn!

322
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,176
So cute!

323
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,560
This one's a must-have too.

324
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:17,656
Someone just placed an order,

325
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:18,712
let me just check.

326
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,656
(Chom, I’m sorry about what happened to Uncle Kajorn.)

327
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:27,984
(What’s up with this household?
(The real bloody legacy.)

328
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,290
Parn!

329
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,688
What happened?

330
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Dad!

331
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,032
Dad!

332
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:44,960
- Dad!
- Hey! Parn!

333
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,328
Parn!

334
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,096
Dad!

335
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:54,848
Uncle Kajorn…

336
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,560
Parn, what happened?

337
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,344
You guys are the ones to tell me.

338
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,910
Parn,

339
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,592
we don’t know about this.

340
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,248
If this really is a game for the legacy

341
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,272
then what did I do wrong?

342
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,944
What did I do wrong

343
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,736
that I have to be dragged into this?

344
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:18,168
Calm down, Parn.

345
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Parn,

346
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,824
no one sees it that way.

347
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,416
Are you sure?

348
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,944
Then answer me, where has Bua gone?

349
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,632
I can’t reach her by phone.

350
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,880
The car is parked in the same place.

351
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Could it be

352
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:50,072
that Bua was kidnapped

353
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,728
by the attacker who killed Uncle Kajorn?

354
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,736
No matter which way you think of it,

355
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,110
none sounds good.

356
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,128
I don’t understand, Pi.

357
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
What’s really happening to our family?

358
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,184
But someone like Bua

359
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,368
would never disappear all of a sudden.

360
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,000
The only thing I can think of now

361
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:15,192
is that she got kidnapped by an attacker.

362
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,496
Don’t forget, Pi,

363
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,424
that girl can also do anything

364
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:25,152
for her own benefit.

365
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,184
Chom.

366
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,552
Did I say anything wrong?

367
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,672
Look at what she did to me

368
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
and to everyone.

369
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,460
Then what are you trying to say?

370
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:37,768
Are you saying that

371
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,448
Bua is the one who killed Kajorn

372
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:40,944
and ran away?

373
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,944
That’s not who Bua is.

374
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,570
Then what’s everyone really like?

375
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,912
After everything that has happened,

376
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,664
I don’t know who we really are anymore.

377
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,776
What are our personalities?

378
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:57,872
I don’t even know

379
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,928
even when we grew up together,

380
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,520
with the same parents,

381
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,864
were brought up the same way,

382
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:04,440
and taught to love each other.

383
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Look at our ‘love’.

384
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
If we really love each other,

385
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,408
would our family be a wreck like this?

386
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,288
Chom.

387
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,712
You’re lashing out.

388
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,280
I understand.

389
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,776
I’m not lashing out

390
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,368
but I’ve just come to my senses.

391
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,544
In our family,

392
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:31,056
we weren’t taught to love each other.

393
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,064
We were taught to love ourselves.

394
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,096
Love ourselves in the way that

395
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,512
you put yourself first.

396
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,176
That’s not true.

397
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,720
That’s not what Mom said.

398
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:46,736
Are you sure?

399
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,568
If you want anything,

400
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,300
you should try harder.

401
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,944
Because if you haven’t got it,

402
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,920
then that means you didn’t try hard enough.

403
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,256
This world has no place for failure.

404
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,600
Even when it comes to your own desire.

405
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,944
2016

406
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:36,950
Here you are!

407
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,120
I’ve been looking for you.

408
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,568
It’s nice and cool here.

409
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,040
Where’s Chat?

410
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,616
I don’t know.

411
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,000
Our bodies are not stuck together.

412
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,488
For Chompoo, from Nop.

413
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Nop?

414
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,792
The school team footballer, Nop?

415
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,440
Is he hitting on you?

416
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,544
I don’t know.

417
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,976
We’ve never talked.

418
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,104
But opening other people's bags like this

419
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:22,320
is so damn rude.

420
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,970
Trash that.

421
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,360
You’re pretty popular, huh?

422
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,984
Of course.

423
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
What are you drawing?

424
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:40,208
Is it nice?

425
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,272
The Buppachat Mansion.

426
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,160
You’re Chompoonuch, right?

427
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:49,032
Yeah, why?

428
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Ouch!

429
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,976
If your reason is not good enough,

430
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,680
you’re done for.

431
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,120
Why are you flirting with my friend’s boyfriend?

432
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,456
Flirting what?

433
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,876
(- You look so cool when you play football.)
(-Then come and watch me play.)
(-I don’t dare go. Your girlfriend would be angry.)
(-I don’t have a girlfriend.)

434
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,168
You know damn well

435
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:14,936
that I’m Nop’s girlfriend.

436
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:16,940
So why did you DM my boyfriend?

437
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:17,952
Huh?

438
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
A girlfriend?

439
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,576
Did you know she’s his girlfriend?

440
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,952
Even he himself said that you’re not.

441
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:28,160
You’re delusional.

442
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:31,872
You!

443
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,784
One more thing,

444
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,176
the account you saw was a fake one.

445
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,160
That’s not my account.

446
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,968
I’ve never flirted with your boyfriend.

447
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,016
It’s yours!

448
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:44,496
This bitch!

449
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:45,992
Why are you picking on me?

450
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,584
I told you

451
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:48,728
that it wasn’t my account.

452
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,216
I’ve never flirted with your boyfriend.

453
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,400
If you're sick, then go see a doctor,

454
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:53,480
don’t just come and pick on me.

455
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
Why?

456
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Come here!

457
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,128
Chom.

458
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,136
Chom.

459
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:01,256
That’s enough.

460
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:02,696
Chom, that’s enough.

461
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
This bitch!

462
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:05,912
You crazy bitch!

463
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:07,408
Stop it!

464
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,816
What are you guys doing?

465
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,216
What are you guys doing?

466
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:16,696
STUDENT WELFARE DEPARTMENT

467
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,680
I’m so bummed out, Mom.

468
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:22,110
Why did I get my points deducted?

469
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,288
I wasn’t the one who started it.

470
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,576
She started it, and I even got hurt.

471
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:28,368
Look.

472
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,720
Instead of realizing what she did wrong…

473
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,776
Remember, as a girl,

474
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:36,344
don’t just put on makeup or dress prettily.

475
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,888
You have to behave nicely too.

476
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,288
Otherwise, a rowdy personality would show.

477
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,776
People could tell how one was brought up.

478
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,180
That’s true.

479
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,460
Some people put on makeup to make themselves look pretty

480
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,592
and carry themselves nicely

481
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,352
but still don't look beautiful.

482
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,488
If being beautiful is easy

483
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,584
then why aren’t you beautiful?

484
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,264
That was so funny!

485
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:30,860
You should have seen the face of that Mom.

486
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,720
She was dumbfounded.

487
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:32,512
For real.

488
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:33,128
Wow…

489
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:34,384
What a shame.

490
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,976
I want to be at the scene too.

491
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,624
This kind of girl should be put in her place.

492
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,620
Her Mum probably didn’t educate her.

493
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Woah.

494
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,536
So scary.

495
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:48,952
But never tell Dad about this.

496
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:52,000
He’s even scarier than the student welfare teacher.

497
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,784
Definitely not telling.

498
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,752
Chom, you have to be more patient.

499
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,224
Alright, Mom.

500
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,888
If you want to be a news anchor,

501
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:10,032
you have to look pretty

502
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:11,456
and carry yourself gracefully.

503
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,830
She’s not worth losing yourself for.

504
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,624
Roger that, Mom.

505
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,960
But I’m still annoyed.

506
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:21,936
I wonder who made the account to impersonate me.

507
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Mom,

508
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,328
it’s time for my piano lesson.

509
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,776
Then I’ll give you a lift.

510
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Okay.

511
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,056
Don’t touch my stuff!

512
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,392
What’s up with her?

513
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,960
No idea.

514
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,712
Why is she so pissed?

515
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,768
Oh, there’s Chom.

516
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,888
Where did she go?

517
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,328
What are you doing?

518
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,032
That’s crazy.

519
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,128
What has Chom done to them?

520
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:38,000
Why did they have to go this far?

521
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,944
Uh.. do you really not know?

522
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,568
Your sister is hated by so many people.

523
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,400
She even has anti-fans on the internet.

524
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,400
What has my sister done to them?

525
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,400
They said your sister

526
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
likes to send DMs to guys

527
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:55,864
who are already taken.

528
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,768
It happened to a lot of people.

529
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:01,280
But your sister, Chatfah,

530
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:03,504
has talked it out for so many cases.

531
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,584
That’s why your sister got away with it.

532
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,152
I think you’re definitely getting to become

533
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:17,152
the school’s drum major this year.

534
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,480
Oh, I’m not sure about that.

535
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,480
That’s always been Chom’s role.

536
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,608
Maybe she’ll get to do it this year too.

537
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:25,784
Actually,

538
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:28,432
Chom used to be Miss Popular Votes every year too.

539
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,320
But you managed to replace her.

540
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:32,040
But how can you not get it?

541
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:34,496
Chom was texting every senior boy who was taken.

542
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,960
The whole school hates her now.

543
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,496
Let me see the pictures.

544
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:39,536
Sure.

545
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,640
Pretty, right?

546
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:42,664
So pretty!

547
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:43,432
So pretty.

548
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,864
Well deserved.

549
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,632
- Sooo pretty.
- Love it.

550
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:48,656
Right?

551
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,056
I shouldn’t have let Chat do that to Chom.

552
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,744
It’s my fault

553
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,608
that I didn’t stop her.

554
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,224
I know that you’re not worried about

555
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:05,768
those votes and all.

556
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,536
But I don’t want Chom to be hated

557
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,960
when she hasn’t done anything.

558
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,016
Don’t cry.

559
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,992
Calm down.

560
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:24,688
I’ll take care of it.

561
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,912
Yes?

562
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:29,040
And stop blaming yourself.

563
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,952
It’s alright.

564
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,080
I know you tried your best to help me.

565
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,936
You know why I called you over, right?

566
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,424
I do.

567
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,224
Why did you do that?

568
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
I want to be a drum major.

569
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,752
I have a dream to become one like Chom.

570
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,160
I want to become a star.

571
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,824
I want to become famous.

572
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,820
I want to have a good profile.

573
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:38,536
I see that Chom got the opportunities

574
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:41,728
because Chom is pretty,

575
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,168
and Chom is smart.

576
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,576
Chom gets to be the school’s star

577
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,736
since she was in middle school.

578
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
She got to be the drum major

579
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,176
since she was my age.

580
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,940
And she has always been one.

581
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:54,810
But I can’t be like Chom

582
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:56,384
if she’s still holding that position.

583
00:35:56,408 --> 00:35:57,800
But you shouldn’t get it

584
00:35:57,832 --> 00:35:59,592
with such a dirty trick, right?

585
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,990
Chat,

586
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,536
Chom got it with her own abilities.

587
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,096
You should get it with your own ability too.

588
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
Your sisters are right.

589
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,584
When you want something,

590
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,800
you should get it with your own abilities.

591
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,544
Also,

592
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:30,260
you can’t do that

593
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:32,610
because she’s your sister.

594
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:35,670
She’s a family member.

595
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,008
We have to love each other since we’re a family.

596
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,032
When people look in on us,

597
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:44,064
how would they perceive our family?

598
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,408
Have you ever thought about that?

599
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:05,860
But I would like to praise you.

600
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,592
I would like to praise you

601
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,590
for your effort.

602
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,960
Because there are probably not many people

603
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,752
who would try this hard

604
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,128
to get what they want.

605
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,752
If you want something,

606
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,008
you have to put effort into it

607
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:33,024
and make it yours.

608
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,230
Therefore,

609
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,600
if Chompoo fails,

610
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,040
this will be a lesson for you that

611
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,600
you haven’t tried hard enough.

612
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,536
Because this world

613
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,200
has no place for you to fail.

614
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:18,784
Even when it comes to your own desires.

615
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:25,552
Do you understand?

616
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:28,270
We really were taught that way.

617
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,304
Even if we have to kill each other,

618
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,736
if that gets us what we want

619
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,664
then that’s the right thing.

620
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,048
So is it still there?

621
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,064
The sincerity among our family?

622
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,160
It’s not there anymore.

623
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,408
The only thing left now is

624
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,112
of all the things that have happened,

625
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,104
who was the one behind it?

626
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,456
YOU ARE NEXT.

627
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,144
Who sent this?

628
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,020
I don’t know.

629
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,208
But for a moment, I thought

630
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,136
there’s only one person

631
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,140
who uses such a dirty trick.

632
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,992
Chatfah.

633
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,552
Why would Chat do that?

634
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,128
I don’t understand.

635
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:00,000
So,

636
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:03,896
Chat made up a story that she’s gone

637
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,424
to come back and stab us in the back

638
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,848
one by one like this?

639
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,288
She might be the only one

640
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,424
who’s trying to find out that truth.

641
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,128
What truth?

642
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,184
Can’t you remember?

643
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,312
That night, when she fell down and disappeared,

644
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,624
what was she talking about then?

645
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,496
She was talking about

646
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,032
who killed mom.

647
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:34,370
(There’s no enemy more frightening)

648
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,560
(than an enemy who knows you best.)

649
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,840
But we both already know the truth

650
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,176
about who killed Mom.

651
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,584
Yes, we knew.

652
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,160
But is what we know

653
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,872
really the truth?

654
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:54,870
What do you mean?

655
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:58,180
Is the Mom we love so much

656
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,384
the Mom we really know?

657
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,160
(So hide your true colors.)

658
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,344
(Don’t let anyone cross the wall into your heart.)

659
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,624
(Sometimes, even family)

660
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:20,620
(might not be a safe zone.)

661
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,264
(If you still want to live, )

662
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,488
(the only one you should protect)

663
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,656
(is yourself.)

664
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,728
Why would you pretend to care about me?

665
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:13,648
I didn’t pretend.

666
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:15,320
That night, when the fire broke out,

667
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:17,072
Sarah probably didn’t escape in time.

668
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:18,576
I can testify for you.

669
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,912
That you were with me all night.

670
00:42:20,928 --> 00:42:22,910
There's CCTV in front of the place.

671
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,152
MISSING

672
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:25,784
Have you seen these two in the pictures?
