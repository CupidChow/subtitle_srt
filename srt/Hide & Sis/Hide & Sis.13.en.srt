1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,696
You must be the one who killed Chat.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,432
I didn’t kill her!

3
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:06,936
You’re here to find out the truth about your dad

4
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:08,940
and now, you know everything.

5
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:12,240
So the two of us no longer need to stay together

6
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:14,240
Please don’t be angry at me.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,816
Eat up!

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,976
Don’t f*cking bother my sisters.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,140
What are you doing in here?

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,856
I’m sorry.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,260
I…

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,664
I thought you went out.

13
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:47,776
So I came in to clean the room.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,352
My friend came to visit me last night.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,280
We had a bit too much to drink.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,632
So I got up late today.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,776
I’ll come back
when you finish getting dressed.

18
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,300
Mr. Asok has been busy with work.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,920
He has a lot of stress because of it.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,520
He won’t be home much.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Yes.

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,512
Don’t bother him with unnecessary things.

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Here.

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,904
I just hung out with my friend
and enjoyed the wine.

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,032
It’s not something

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,728
that Mr. Asok needs to know, right?

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,248
Mr. Asok often told me.

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,344
He trusts me to take care of this house.

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,184
I need to tell him everything
that happens in the house.

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,456
No matter what it is or who it’s concerned.

31
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,328
Does it include…

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,696
your habit of secretly wearing my clothes

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,128
and walking around the house?

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,448
As if…

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,816
you were the lady of the house.

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,840
I get it.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,752
Every woman,

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,552
We all want a rich husband

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,640
who can provide a comfortable life for us.

40
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:32,792
I’m also a woman.

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,768
I get it.

42
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,792
But I’m not sure

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,472
if Mr. Asok will understand it.

44
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,170
If one day he finds out

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,624
that his maid…

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,984
who has been taking care of his house and kids,

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,496
she has this secret ambition.

48
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,792
I can’t imagine

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,576
how he would react.

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,184
You should stick to the job you are good at.

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,824
Cleaning up the house.

52
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
Pi.

53
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,350
Bua.

54
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,048
Come and help me with her.

55
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,050
Picha.

56
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,968
Pi.

57
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,008
Pi.

58
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,800
What did she put in her tea?

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,272
I don’t know.

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,610
Old witch.

61
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:55,460
What did you put in her tea?

62
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,136
Hello, Tina.

63
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
What?

64
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:10,510
Hold on. I can’t hear you.

65
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,400
Hello?

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,656
You bitches.

67
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,104
Buntharika.

68
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,408
Chompoonuch, Pudpichaya, Chatfah.

69
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,120
You think you are the flowers
of Bupphachat Mansion, right?

70
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,048
But the truth is that you are insects
swarming around rotten garbage.

71
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:01,640
You’re not superior to others.

72
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Tell me.

73
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
What the hell did you put in her tea?

74
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,368
It’s pesticide.

75
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,904
I wanted your parents to see

76
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,176
how screwed up their daughters are.

77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,320
Why the fuck did you do this to us?

78
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:29,512
What have we ever done to you?

79
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:33,048
You are living in an ivory tower.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,050
You didn’t know anything.

81
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,560
Mrs. Fai died because of you guys.

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,384
Parn ended up like this because of you.

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,568
Many people lost everything

84
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:49,176
because of your family.

85
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,456
It serves you right.

86
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,104
Damn, what the hell is she talking about?

87
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Pi.

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,280
Pi.

89
00:05:58,312 --> 00:05:59,080
Pi.

90
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:00,864
Let’s take her to the hospital.

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Pi.

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Pi.

93
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,224
Picha.

94
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,232
Pi.

95
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,072
(People whom we love)

96
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,432
(they can hurt us more than those who hate us.)

97
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,552
(The more we love them)

98
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
(The less we should trust them.)

99
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,680
You can’t come in.

100
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,760
I’ll take care of her.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Okay.

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,664
(Because a serpent, )

103
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,624
Yes, Captain.

104
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,064
(it’s not as scary as a friend who betrays you.)

105
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:44,608
Aunty Chom is still there, right?

106
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,610
Yes, she’s still here.

107
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,832
She is the one
who killed Uncle Kajorn and Chat.

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,528
(If you are bitten by them,
no serum can heal you.)

109
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,016
We need to investigate it further.

110
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,296
But…

111
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,416
I’m afraid we won’t get any info from her.

112
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,912
(Only death is waiting for us.)

113
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Here.

114
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,000
I can’t believe Aunty Chom killed herself
to run away from her crimes.

115
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,384
I was worried about Pi.

116
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,744
So I forgot that we should keep an eye on her
until the police arrived.

117
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,049
No one would think about it
if they were in our situation.

118
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,872
I can’t believe it.

119
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,608
Aunty Chom was the murderer.

120
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,856
I almost let her get away with her crimes.

121
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,568
I think…

122
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,824
she might not be the murderer.

123
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,630
Excuse me.

124
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,192
If it wasn’t her, who else could it be?

125
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,080
She almost got me into the ICU with Pi.

126
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,240
I know.

127
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,432
I know that she hated us.

128
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,160
But Chat’s attack,

129
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,920
I don’t think she did it.

130
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,144
If it’s not her.

131
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,808
Is it you?

132
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Hey.

133
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,408
You haven’t told me.

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,712
Where have you been
since Uncle Kajorn was killed?

135
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,704
I have my reason to run away.

136
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,656
Then tell me your reason right now.

137
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,660
Otherwise, I’ll get you arrested.

138
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,424
Aunty Chom also sabotaged me.

139
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,984
She switched my medication,
and my sleepwalking got worse.

140
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,544
I sleepwalked to where Uncle Kajorn was.

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,448
But when I found him,

142
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:45,910
he was already dead.

143
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,152
Do you remember Mangkorn?

144
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,768
Mangkorn from Chat’s journal.

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,320
His name is Arch.

146
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,048
He saved me.

147
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,240
He took care of me.

148
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,752
He helped me
investigate things that happened.

149
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:02,776
Wait.

150
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,104
You trust him?

151
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,400
I trusted him at first.

152
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Until…

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,696
There’s one thing you need to know.

154
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
What is it?

155
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,312
Miss Pudpichaya’s family,
the doctor wants to see you.

156
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,760
Pi’s condition is now out of danger.

157
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,632
The doctor said she was lucky
that she only took a small sip of the tea.

158
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:39,408
They gave her an antidote.

159
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,552
Where is Baibua?

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,640
You told me she was back.

161
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,072
She said she would cooperate with the police.

162
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,240
She’s talking to the doctor right now.

163
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,992
I’m sorry about this.

164
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,152
I never thought it would be
someone close to us like Aunty Chom.

165
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,470
I have one more thing I need to tell you.

166
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Um…

167
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,560
When Chain and I were on our way
to Bupphachat Mansion,

168
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,860
we received a call.

169
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,712
You, check that way.

170
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:31,728
Yes.

171
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:36,936
We believe that he ran his truck
into a tree on the side of the road.

172
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Mr. Thana was found dead at the scene.

173
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,664
Headquarters, we found a dead driver.

174
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,160
We think the accident happened
around the time you took Picha to the hospital.

175
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Chom.

176
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,472
Are you okay?

177
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,576
I stayed at my apartment last night.

178
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,032
So I wasn’t here.

179
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,432
Yes.

180
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,930
Miss Parn.

181
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,280
Where were you when this happened?

182
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,240
I took a sleeping pill.

183
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,320
I was sleeping in my room.

184
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,400
No matter how many times we face a loss,
we don’t seem to get used to it.

185
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,944
I’m ready to fully cooperate with the police.

186
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,304
I will also tell you where I was all this time.

187
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,744
You said you ran away to avoid
being a suspect in Mr. Kajorn’s death, right?

188
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,250
Yes.

189
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,872
I was investigating everything that happened
to prove my innocence.

190
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,896
You found everything in this flash drive
by yourself?

191
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,656
No, someone helped me.

192
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:12,400
He’s Chatfah’s half-brother.

193
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,090
Hello.

194
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,376
We contacted the deceased’s family
living in another province.

195
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,144
They will come to receive his body this evening.

196
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,176
Thank you.

197
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,320
When his family arrives, can you call me?

198
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,736
What was your relationship with Mr. Thana?

199
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,656
I was his friend, his close friend.

200
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:44,816
Sure.

201
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,248
Excuse me, are you Mr. Thana’s friend?

202
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,230
Yes.

203
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,808
Why, Officer?

204
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,824
I was informed
that the suspect in my case was dead.

205
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,296
So I came here to confirm it.

206
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,784
The suspect?

207
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,656
What do you mean?

208
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:13,184
Mr. Thana Satratawee was suspected
of killing the witness in the Black Fairy fire.

209
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,568
How did he become the suspect?

210
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,552
A CCTV camera captured him
entering the hospital.

211
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:23,608
He was disguised as a nurse.

212
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,160
He went into the witness’s room.

213
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,016
Shortly after that, the witness died.

214
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:39,128
Khem.

215
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Picha.

216
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,360
How are you feeling?

217
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,376
Do you have any pain?

218
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,936
I was so scared.

219
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:55,608
I’m fine now.

220
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,976
You don’t need to say anything.

221
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,360
Can we stay like this for a while?

222
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,896
Things are coming to an end.

223
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,980
Sarah’s friend will gain consciousness soon.

224
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,808
Then the police will know

225
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,584
that I started the fire at the nightclub.

226
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,408
If I can help you on this,

227
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,616
will l…

228
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,944
be ahead of Nathat?

229
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,208
What medicine is that?

230
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,536
It’s my medicine.

231
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,552
POTASSIUM CHLORIDE IS USED
TO TREAT HYPOKALEMIA
FROM SEVERE DIARRHEA OR VOMITING.

232
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:56,712
Captain.

233
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,544
I’m here to search Mr. Thana’s house.

234
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,000
What’s going on?

235
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,120
You aren’t in charge of the Black Fairy fire case.

236
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,390
No.

237
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,968
I’m here because of Miss Chomchai’s murder.

238
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,168
Murder?

239
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,760
But she killed herself, didn’t she?

240
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,176
We found many abnormalities
in the rope knots and her autopsy.

241
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,264
More importantly, we found fingerprints
and footprints at the crime scene.

242
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:35,328
They belonged to Mr. Thana,
who should not have been there.

243
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,944
It’s highly possible that
he sneaked into the house after you left.

244
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,008
I’m not sure
if this is a side effect of the medication.

245
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,792
When I woke up,

246
00:19:56,984 --> 00:19:58,980
I didn’t remember anything.

247
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,200
It felt like a dream to me.

248
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,500
Which part do you not remember?

249
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,032
The poisoning.

250
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,896
I remember drinking the tea.

251
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,400
Then I felt like I was dreaming.

252
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,520
But from what Chom told me,

253
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,920
she said I was half awake.

254
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:27,920
I wasn’t unconscious.

255
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,672
But when I woke up,
I didn’t remember anything.

256
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,888
I didn’t remember
if anyone did something to me.

257
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,200
It’s likely a side effect of the medication.

258
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
That’s what I thought at first.

259
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,280
But this is not the first time it happened to me.

260
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,616
Sometimes, I lose memories of a certain moment.

261
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,176
I can’t remember
what happened in those moments.

262
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,472
Has this happened to you before?

263
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,768
How is it?

264
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,220
It’s from the forensic science center.

265
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,952
They’ve identified the remains found at the farm.

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,896
But we searched the crime records database
and didn’t find a match.

267
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,250
Yes.

268
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,608
What if this person
has never been reported missing?

269
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,940
Then we won’t find her name in the database.

270
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,392
So this person…

271
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,088
It’s likely that she is assumed to be alive

272
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:43,568
after she ran away with another man.

273
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,090
That’s why no one reported her
as a missing person.

274
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,768
So I searched the list of people
who left the farm during that time.

275
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,176
Send the remains for a DNA test.

276
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:57,920
Inform her relative to come in for a DNA test.

277
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,432
This is the result.

278
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:08,740
It’s someone we never imagined, right?

279
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,872
Thank you, Chompoo,

280
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,768
for contacting me from time to time.

281
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,088
I still miss Sarah.

282
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,552
Sure.

283
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,576
How is Sarah’s case going?

284
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,984
I know the truth about everything.

285
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,592
I know who started the fire.

286
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,304
How did you find out?

287
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,672
Sarah’s friend told me

288
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,832
Sarah’s friend told me
after he gained consciousness and before he died.

289
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,848
Now, the police know…

290
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,304
that Sarah started the fire.

291
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,424
What?

292
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,792
Stop playing hard to get.

293
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,336
I know you are easy.

294
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,320
It’s good that my injury is not serious.

295
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:25,080
Damn it. There’s a camera here.

296
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,584
What if she reports it to the police?

297
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,024
Sarah, what the hell are you doing?

298
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,816
I’m going to burn everything.

299
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,820
So there will be no evidence left.

300
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:01,904
If we are asked about it,

301
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,584
we just blame it on Chompoo.

302
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Sarah, you are nuts.

303
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,648
What the heck?!

304
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,810
Sarah.

305
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,096
Sarah.

306
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,980
Sarah.

307
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Sarah.

308
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,800
Shit. Help me.

309
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:32,580
Help.

310
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,080
I’m very sorry.

311
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,968
I never thought she would be the cause
of other people’s deaths.

312
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:53,720
The person who started the fire
at the nightclub that night is Sarah?

313
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:12,860
I heard about your house helper.

314
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,856
Did you get hurt?

315
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
No.

316
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,176
I’m fine.

317
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,600
Do you think she attacked Chatfah?

318
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,064
She switched my medication.

319
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,800
She tried to frame Chom and poisoned Pi.

320
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,064
She hated us enough to kill us
because she held grudges against my dad.

321
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,952
Everything is pointing that she did it, but…

322
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,384
I’m still unsure.

323
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Why?

324
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,368
I don’t know.

325
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,480
I don’t have a particular reason.

326
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,568
Anyway, I need to be strong.

327
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:08,340
So my sisters can lean on me.

328
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,368
You are their big sister.

329
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,848
But don’t forget

330
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,512
that you are also a human.

331
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,488
It’s okay to be weak sometimes.

332
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,384
You don’t need to be strong all the time.

333
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,056
If my dad were still here,

334
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,752
he would say the opposite.

335
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,440
Your dad might love you more than you think.

336
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:51,750
Chatfah told me

337
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,528
that the will that you saw was a new one.

338
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,568
It was written recently.

339
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:09,740
There’s a chance that
his old will may be somewhere in the mansion.

340
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,910
Bua.

341
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,344
This is probably the last time we meet.

342
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,392
I know the truth about everything.

343
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,400
I no longer have a reason to stay here.

344
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,690
Hey.

345
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,272
Take care of yourself, okay?

346
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,000
It’s my fault.

347
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:28,730
I told him I started the fire.

348
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,560
So he did everything to protect me.

349
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,872
It’s my fault.

350
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,248
If I didn’t tell him that,

351
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,576
Thana wouldn’t have killed the witness.

352
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,768
He didn’t have to do it.

353
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Chom.

354
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,152
Stop blaming yourself.

355
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
You didn’t tell him to kill the witness.

356
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,104
If I didn’t manipulate him,

357
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,952
he wouldn’t have done those terrible things.

358
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,950
This is my fault.

359
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,376
It’s my fault.

360
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,504
Is it possible
that this whole thing was Thana’s plan?

361
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,048
He might be Chatfah’s attacker.

362
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,360
I never thought we would get to this point.

363
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,392
The point where everything we see
will no longer be ours.

364
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,480
None of them have been ours from the start.

365
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,728
The wealth,

366
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,120
the fame,

367
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,424
and this house.

368
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,152
But for me,

369
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,008
what remains ours is that
we still have each other.

370
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,552
I’m very glad that I still have you guys.

371
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,032
Everything around me is just material things.

372
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:47,030
I can get its replacement any time I want.

373
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,808
But you guys,

374
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:52,768
you are people I don’t want to lose.

375
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,088
Why did you tell me to come here?

376
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,968
I have something important

377
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,072
that I want us to find out together.

378
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,488
I think…

379
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:27,180
the will that we saw,

380
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
it was written recently.

381
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,792
Are you saying it’s fake?

382
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,040
It could be a real one.

383
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,800
But it was definitely written recently.

384
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,928
After…

385
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,960
Dad found out

386
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,680
that Chat wasn’t his child.

387
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Chat.

388
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,184
She is Mom’s child with the man named Chad.

389
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,024
Her affair partner.

390
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,600
Are you sure it will be in this safe?

391
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:21,600
Dad hadn’t used it for a long time.

392
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:23,192
Because that’s what we thought.

393
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:25,376
So we never opened it after Dad died.

394
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,456
Do you know the combination to the safe?

395
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,968
I have an idea.

396
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,432
It’s really Pi’s birthday.

397
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,384
Why?

398
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,480
Why did he use my birthday?

399
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:47,560
Because he loved you more than you think.

400
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,368
There’s nothing in here.

401
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,080
Is this his will?

402
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,136
No.

403
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,632
It’s his letter.

404
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,330
His letter to the three of us.

405
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,200
If any of you are reading this letter,

406
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,648
it means that my will has been opened.

407
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,656
(You three might have questions
about why you don’t get anything.)

408
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,520
(I don’t know when you find out the truth, )

409
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,088
(will you be mad or hate me even more?)

410
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,760
(But it’s okay.)

411
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,728
(I have my reasons why I did it.)

412
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,608
(I’ve braced myself for the consequences.)

413
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,816
(It’s included being hated or scolded by you.)

414
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:58,184
(No matter what, )

415
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,144
(you shouldn’t be punished for what I did)

416
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,496
(The only inheritance I want to give you
is freedom.)

417
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,304
(I want you to live your life
free from those allegations.)

418
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,864
(I want you to live as an innocent
with no criminal records.)

419
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,088
(This is the last thing I can give you.)

420
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
(I’m sorry.)

421
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,512
He did that to protect us…

422
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
from what he did?

423
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:40,208
Come here and look at this.

424
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,176
The secret that Dad had kept.

425
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,992
Mom also didn’t want anyone to find out.

426
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,568
These are documents of
our company’s chemical and pesticide orders.

427
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,800
They were not used on our farm.

428
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,432
But they were used to produce cheap drugs.

429
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,160
Our company was the center of illegal business.

430
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,344
If this is true,
then why did Dad give everything to Chatfah?

431
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:21,528
Don’t tell me…

432
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,528
he did this to punish Mom?

433
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,952
Because Mom loved Chatfah the most.

434
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,980
Chat knew everything, didn’t she?

435
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,520
Being rejected by your own family,

436
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,976
that is the most painful thing.

437
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,056
Do you think…

438
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,512
if we went to meet Chat like she told us,

439
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,072
what would happen?

440
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,296
We would find out everything that night.

441
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,810
Look here.

442
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,740
Aunt Fai,

443
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,240
she was Uncle Kajorn’s wife and Parn’s mom.

444
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,856
She knew our family’s secret.

445
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,112
We have a daughter.

446
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:36,186
Have you ever thought about her
when you are doing this?

447
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,720
We started it. We can’t stop now.

448
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,976
We won’t be doing it for long.

449
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,832
When we reach our goal, we will quit.

450
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,832
We have a powerful backer.

451
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:47,580
Otherwise, we would have been busted
a long time ago.

452
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,184
What about other effects?

453
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,768
Do you know how many people died
because of the drug?

454
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,208
Have you ever cared about those people?

455
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:56,504
Did I force them to buy it?

456
00:36:56,536 --> 00:36:57,552
They bought it of their own will.

457
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:58,784
Kajorn!

458
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,048
Everything that you have today
is bought with my money.

459
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,160
I don’t want it anymore.

460
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:04,008
I want a divorce.

461
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:05,792
I will run away with our daughter.

462
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,136
If she has to have a father like you,

463
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:09,736
I would rather die.

464
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,580
Fai.

465
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Fai.

466
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
What do you want?

467
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,070
What do you mean?

468
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,280
You are making a scene.

469
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:31,520
What do you want from it?

470
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,336
I want you guys to stop right now.

471
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:37,648
I don’t want my kid to grow up
with a drug dealer dad.

472
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,952
You are not only a drug dealer,
but also a producer.

473
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
If you don’t tell anyone,

474
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,768
no one will know.

475
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,576
How long do you think
you can run away from the truth?

476
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,928
I know you can do anything for money.

477
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,816
But I never thought it would get this far.

478
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,270
Fai.

479
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,744
I will never let you leave this farm,

480
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,624
if you don’t tell me your conditions.

481
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,040
I don’t want your filthy money.

482
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:19,888
Chat.

483
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:30,272
Girls.

484
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,584
Girls, sweetie.

485
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,480
Oh my goodness.

486
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,080
Girls, hang on.

487
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:40,592
I’ll come down to help you.

488
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Picha.

489
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,432
Chatfah.

490
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:51,296
Asok, help the girls first.

491
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,992
Get a rope.

492
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,090
Picha.

493
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,488
Chatfah.

494
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:02,490
Fai, catch the rope.

495
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,360
Asok, help me pull them up.

496
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,080
Asok, call an ambulance.

497
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
Asok.

498
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,776
What are you doing?

499
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,180
Kajorn, help me.

500
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,180
Please help me.

501
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,288
If she is not dead, you and I are screwed.

502
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,184
But she is the mother of my child.

503
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,064
Do you want to go to jail?

504
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,776
Help me, Kajorn.

505
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:00,968
Kajorn.

506
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,160
I curse you.

507
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,504
You all will burn in hell.

508
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,976
(Those who are close to us, )

509
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,376
(They can hurt us the most
when they backstab us.)

510
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,720
THE DNA TEST CONFIRMS THAT
THE REMAINS BELONG TO
MRS. NONGPHAKA BUPPHACHINDA

511
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,872
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF
MISS NIRAMOL BUPPHACHINDA.

512
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,960
(But they are also the easiest ones
we can push away)

513
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,920
(So when they betrayed us,
we need to pull ourselves together.)

514
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,256
Aunt Fai.

515
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,048
The remains found in the well
belong to Aunt Fai.

516
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,336
She was killed by Dad and Uncle Kajorn.

517
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,208
Dad and Uncle Kajorn killed Parn’s mom?

518
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,336
I knew you would be the first one to come here.

519
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,720
Are you sure?

520
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,856
Am I the one you expected to see?

521
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,664
(We need to quickly find a way
to take revenge)

522
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,760
(before we miss our chance.)

523
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,216
Why do you look so surprised?

524
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,128
Sister.

525
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,464
Miss Chompoonuch, you need to come with us
for a murder investigation.

526
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:03,960
Being abandoned by our loved ones
is the most painful thing.

527
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:05,392
You should continue to feel guilty.

528
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,800
We found signs of struggles.

529
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,440
So we believe this is not a suicide.

530
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,984
Where is Parn?

531
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,904
What I am going to do to your family
is worse than that.
