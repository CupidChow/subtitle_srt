1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,480
But whenever

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,904
I lost my patience,

3
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,210
perhaps that might no longer be fun for you.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,568
Based on a lot of things over the past few days,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,112
I think you’re being targeted.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,411
SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT
RECEIVER: BUNTHARIKA BUPPHACHINDA

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,792
YOU ARE NEXT.

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,656
(There’s a saying, )

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,560
(people’s minds are like liquids.)

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,128
(They always flow to a lower place.)

11
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,480
(That’s why…)

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,024
(many people are not afraid of going to hell.)

13
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,888
What happened?

14
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,272
I didn’t mean it.

15
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,270
It is dark. I didn’t see him.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Is he dead?

17
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:33,976
He’s still alive.

18
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,240
Please call an ambulance.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,408
Call now.

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Call an ambulance.

21
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:55,664
I don’t have my phone with me.

22
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,696
(It doesn’t matter.)

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,320
(Because they were born in hell.)

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,840
What do you want?

25
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:14,944
I’ll ask questions.

26
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,696
You answer.

27
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,384
What did you do to Chatfah?

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,848
Where is she?

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,580
I don’t know.

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,048
You must know something.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,570
I also want to know where she is.

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,290
I…

33
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,570
You what?

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,070
Where are you going?

35
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:46,456
(I’m not afraid of hell.)

36
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:47,488
You!

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
What’s wrong?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,936
Help.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,816
Help me.

40
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,480
Help, a man attacked…

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,184
(Because I know I’ll end up in hell.)

42
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,768
(But I’m afraid that
I can’t pull someone down with me.)

43
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,368
Didn’t you say you were going to bed?

44
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:16,000
Where were you?

45
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,544
My shop’s server went down.

46
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,200
I needed to go in and check it.

47
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,970
Where is Chom?

48
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,450
Don’t ask me about her yet.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,280
How are you feeling?

50
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,168
Let’s go to a hospital.

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,480
I don’t need to go to a hospital.

52
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,832
I need to go to a police station.

53
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,944
I have something to show you.

54
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,192
His tattoo.

55
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,570
Isn’t it strange?

56
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,688
We just found that
Chat was supposed to meet Mangkorn.

57
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,192
Maybe Mangkorn means
a man with a dragon tattoo?

58
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Huh?

59
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,344
He asked me where Chatfah is.

60
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,592
He was supposed to meet her on that day.

61
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:06,288
But she fell off the house and disappeared.

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,880
He must be her attacker.

63
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,016
I don’t know.

64
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,696
If he is the attacker,

65
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,264
why did he ask me about Chatfah?

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,128
Shouldn’t he run away?

67
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I think…

68
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,770
he is also looking for Chat.

69
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,184
By pointing a knife at your throat?

70
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,312
I think he wanted to hurt you.

71
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,352
He is definitely the attacker.

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,120
You are finally here.

73
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:47,456
Where have you been?

74
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,024
Didn’t you say you would sleep over with her?

75
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,370
I went to find the truth.

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,200
What truth?

77
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,952
The truth that you lied to me.

78
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,380
THE PREGNANCY TEST IS NEGATIVE.

79
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,152
Do you think you can fool everyone?

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,320
If I didn’t have connections in the hospital,

81
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:21,824
I wouldn’t know the truth.

82
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,120
No matter what Dad’s will says.

83
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,648
All the shares I will receive from the will,

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I’ll give all of them to you.

85
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,048
If you keep my pregnancy test a secret.

86
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,432
Don’t you want the company shares?

87
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,960
You will trade them for a man?

88
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,520
You are trading your sister for them, too.

89
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,576
You want to be the company’s chairman.

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,984
So you agree to help me with my scheme.

91
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,832
Don’t you think…

92
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,752
Chom will be devastated
if she finds out the truth?

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,384
We both have our reasons.

94
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,380
I have my reasons.

95
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,496
You have your reasons.

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,776
Now, we’re both walking a tightrope.

97
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,576
You lied to me.

98
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,408
You lied to Nathat.

99
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,552
You lied to all of us.

100
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,176
For money?

101
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,456
Chom.

102
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,620
I’m doing everything for our family.

103
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,312
I need to hold as many shares as possible.

104
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:20,168
Uncle Kajorn has a lot of influence
over the executive board.

105
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,504
If I didn’t do anything, our family
would lose its power in the company.

106
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,856
You did that for our family?

107
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,192
B*tch, you did it for your benefits.

108
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,968
Don’t try to make yourself look good.

109
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,552
When you tell everyone
that you did it for our family,

110
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:42,928
does it make you feel better?

111
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,320
I don’t get it.

112
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,580
Don’t you feel anything?

113
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,768
When you see me sad.

114
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Huh?

115
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,384
You betrayed me.

116
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,336
You ruined Nathat’s life and mine.

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I…

118
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,000
I have to watch the man I love
marrying my sister.

119
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,230
Have you ever thought about
how painful it would be for me?

120
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,192
Have you ever thought about that?

121
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,090
Bua.

122
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,370
Is it true?

123
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,656
So what?

124
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,384
Even if I didn’t do that,

125
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,944
it wouldn’t change anything.

126
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,368
What the hell do you mean?

127
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,544
I wouldn’t change the fact that…

128
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,832
Nathat slept with Chat.

129
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,720
Whether she was pregnant or not,

130
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,872
They both had betrayed you.

131
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,520
So you…

132
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,384
you had to do that?

133
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,544
You had to betray me, too?

134
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,864
You thought I would be hurt by it anyway.

135
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,952
So you chose to earn benefits from my loss?

136
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,180
You don’t understand you.

137
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,800
Didn’t you say we are sisters?

138
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:00,424
How could you do this to your sister?

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,664
Because you never understand me.

140
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
What?

141
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,620
You never understand anything.

142
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,216
You never know how I feel…

143
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,312
and what I’ve been through.

144
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,240
I’m the oldest sister.

145
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,016
What kind of pressure I need to endure.

146
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,232
When you left the house,

147
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,416
I had to carry our family’s hopes.

148
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,420
I had to be the head of the family.

149
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,176
I had to manage everything that Dad left.

150
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,136
While you…

151
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,472
and you,

152
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,120
You went out to live your life
and pursue your dream.

153
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:01,584
What about me?

154
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,472
Have you ever thought of me?

155
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:07,010
So this is my fault?

156
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,672
Did you hear what you said?

157
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,064
Did you punish me
for everything you went through?

158
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,376
Why did you make me pay for it?

159
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,752
No, I don’t understand you.

160
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,040
I will never understand it.

161
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:31,072
You said you did it for our family.

162
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:33,430
Am I not your family?

163
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,768
Have you ever seen me as your sister?

164
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,776
Don’t worry, Bua.

165
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,920
Don’t worry that
Dad would be disappointed in you.

166
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,184
I know he would be very proud of you.

167
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:15,352
Because you’re so damn much like him.

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,472
I think he is giving you a big hand from hell.

169
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,440
Chom.

170
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:30,464
Chom.

171
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,420
Please go back and talk things out with her.

172
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,384
At this point,
what do we have left to talk about?

173
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,768
Chom.

174
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:43,120
It might be a misunderstanding.

175
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,432
Do you know what Chat said to me?

176
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,768
She said she didn’t do anything.

177
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,184
We fell into the trap of our own demons.

178
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,928
Then we blamed her for it.

179
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,360
Because we were afraid
to admit our wrongdoings.

180
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,740
Pi.

181
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,744
I won’t ask you to understand me.

182
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,776
I know I did a horrible thing.

183
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,032
No matter what I say,

184
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,552
it will sound like an excuse.

185
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,824
Tell me what you have to say.

186
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,024
Then I’ll decide if I can understand you or not.

187
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,384
Do you understand me?

188
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,376
I did it for our family.

189
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,944
Even if it means you had to hurt Chom,

190
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,370
you still chose to do it?

191
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:26,140
I always thought…

192
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,736
you did everything for our family.

193
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,712
But now I don’t get it.

194
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,216
I don’t know anymore,

195
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,736
when you say our family,

196
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,160
does it still include Choom and me?

197
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,160
Or does it mean you only?

198
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Chom.

199
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,550
Nathat.

200
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,730
I…

201
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,856
I…

202
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,624
I’m sorry, Miss Baibua.

203
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,184
I’ll come back later.

204
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,736
It’s okay.

205
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,250
Come in.

206
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,370
Yes.

207
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
What?

208
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,792
I got the file from the CCTV at the farm.

209
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:45,368
Now, I know why the ground at the farm
looks like it was recently dug.

210
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:00,216
The video is not sharp.

211
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,088
But it shows that someone walked into the area.

212
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,984
It’s him again?

213
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,328
Call the police and tell them

214
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,984
we will send the file to them.

215
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,430
Yes.

216
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,776
Dig the whole area.

217
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,168
Captain, I found something.

218
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,456
You found it?

219
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,410
Yes.

220
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:27,704
There’s something in the well.

221
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,296
I think this case is no longer easy.

222
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,016
Some of them are lying.

223
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,360
Maybe all of them.

224
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,570
What’s up?

225
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,448
I have something to tell you.

226
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,024
Can you come to meet me?

227
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,790
I…

228
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,792
I don’t think I can meet you right now.

229
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:23,432
Captain, I found it.

230
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,408
Are you leaving now?

231
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:38,848
I should leave.

232
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,768
Before someone sees me.

233
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,552
Do we need to hide our relationship like this?

234
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,392
You know why.

235
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,620
No one can see us together.

236
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,976
Things have changed.

237
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,552
Things can be changed again, right?

238
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,048
I’ll tell the police the truth

239
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,152
about what happened that night.

240
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,776
So you won’t need Thana’s help anymore.

241
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Nathat.

242
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,700
Thana helped you fake your alibi.

243
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,336
Why did he do that?

244
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:40,168
It was nothing.

245
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,144
I don’t believe you.

246
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,296
Even if I ask you again,

247
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,176
you won’t tell me anyway.

248
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,416
That’s why I want to tell the truth
to the police and everyone.

249
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,560
I love you, Chom.

250
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,648
Even though the whole nation will hate me,

251
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,030
I don’t care.

252
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,976
I want to be with you.

253
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,360
I want to live a happy life with you.

254
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I won’t hurt you again.

255
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,184
A medical examiner is on his way.

256
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,016
The case is getting complicated.

257
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,360
From a missing person case,
it has now turned into a murder case.

258
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,304
You can’t go in.

259
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:41,584
Only police officers are allowed to go in.

260
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,056
Move. This is my sister.

261
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:44,096
Police are investigating the scene.

262
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
You can’t go in.

263
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:47,976
Come in.

264
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,230
Wait.

265
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,400
Don’t tell me…

266
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,504
that’s Chatfah?

267
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
No.

268
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,328
If only bones are left like this,

269
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,656
it takes around a year and a half.

270
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,032
So…

271
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,328
I think this is not your sister.

272
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,792
Then who is this?

273
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,090
Hello.

274
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,792
You came to pick up the painting?

275
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:03,560
Wait a minute. I’ll be right there.

276
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,130
Chom.

277
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,624
Why are you late?

278
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,536
Sorry.

279
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,176
My errand took longer than I thought.

280
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,180
Are you ready?

281
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Yes.

282
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,820
If you are ready, let’s go in.

283
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,928
GRANDMA

284
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,130
We came to give an additional statement.

285
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Sure.

286
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,848
The truth is…

287
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,576
That night.

288
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,768
At Bupphachat Mansion.

289
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,370
I…

290
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,640
I went there to meet Chatfah.

291
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,560
I knew that
their father’s will was disclosed on that day.

292
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,512
I was worried about her.

293
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,672
I couldn’t reach her on the phone.

294
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,976
So I called Chompoo.

295
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,296
I was in front of the house.

296
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:25,700
But I decided not to go in.

297
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,264
I didn’t want to give anyone the wrong idea
if they saw me with Chompoo.

298
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,352
I came to give my statement.

299
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:42,312
Because I heard that you are checking
phone records on that night.

300
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,904
I don’t want to become a suspect.

301
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
So I came to tell you the truth.

302
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Here.

303
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,296
All the evidence.

304
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:05,540
I affirm that…

305
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,184
to me, Chompoo…

306
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,624
she is just my fiancée’s sister.

307
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,576
He sneaked in to dig the ground in our farm?

308
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,424
So the ground would look soft.

309
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,000
The police would get suspicious.

310
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:36,256
Did he know that a body was buried there?

311
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,760
Who is he?

312
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Chom.

313
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,776
How can you do this to me?

314
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,384
This is not what we agreed on.

315
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,000
This is for the best,

316
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,808
for you and me.

317
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,440
For the best? What does it mean?

318
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,728
Trust me.

319
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:10,760
Because I trusted you.

320
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,620
That’s why things turned out this way.

321
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Chom.

322
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,984
I’m sorry.

323
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,984
You’re sorry?

324
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,576
Next time, if you can keep your promise,

325
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:26,088
then don’t say it.

326
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,472
I’m sorry.

327
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,576
I’m really sorry.

328
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,552
From now on,

329
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,904
the only person I will trust,

330
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,968
it’s me.

331
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,968
Do you really think I don’t know

332
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,970
what you did behind my back?

333
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,256
I assigned you to manage everything for me because you’re my daughter-in-law.

334
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,384
But it doesn’t mean that I won’t check it.

335
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,630
I know you did me dirty.

336
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,272
You secretly sold several pieces of land I owned.

337
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:23,352
From now on,

338
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,816
Everything that you used to have
will be taken away

339
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,328
Just like your future.

340
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,704
Mother, please don’t do that.

341
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,904
You can’t even raise your son well.

342
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,280
If you threaten my mom
because I want to get back with Chompoo,

343
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,792
I want to tell you this.

344
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,464
This has nothing to do with my mom.

345
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,576
It was all my fault.

346
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
I just wanted to fix it.

347
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,000
By making things worse?

348
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,192
If you want to choose that woman
over your family, you can do that.

349
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,936
But don’t drag me into this mess.

350
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,392
I spent decades
building my reputation in the business.

351
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,328
I will never let my loser grandson ruin it.

352
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,720
Mother.

353
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,680
Mother.

354
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,336
Nathat, come and beg her.

355
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,376
Nathat.

356
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,248
Promise her
that you will stay away from that family.

357
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,168
Hello.

358
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,790
(Did you take care of everything?)

359
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,408
Did you hear what happened on our farm?

360
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,608
I heard that…

361
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,520
the police found a body on our farm.

362
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,104
Why do you think…

363
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,864
I know anything about it?

364
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,968
Is it because I often visit the farm?

365
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,272
It could be one of the workers,

366
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,784
or someone who sneaked into our farm.

367
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:12,416
But in our farm,

368
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,440
CCTV cameras have been installed
for more than ten years.

369
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:20,820
It’s just my speculation.

370
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:27,336
The body might have been there
before the cameras were installed,

371
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,024
or since I was young.

372
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Bua.

373
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,568
What you need to focus on right now

374
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,070
is the company’s stability.

375
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,768
About the investigation,

376
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:43,900
let the police do their job.

377
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,368
That’s right.

378
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,376
That area used to be a well.

379
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:54,928
It was buried
because you installed a new water system.

380
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,530
Am I right?

381
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,160
I just ask you the question
that the police will have.

382
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,456
So you will have time to prepare your answer,

383
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:06,980
when you are interrogated.

384
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,912
You mom.

385
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,392
She told you a lot about me.

386
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,400
Did she tell you this?

387
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,472
If something happens to me,

388
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,880
You and your sisters won’t get off the hook either.

389
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,152
The body that they found,

390
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,624
it might not be the only secret in our family.

391
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,168
The well is discovered.

392
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,770
Do you think…

393
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,520
that you won’t be dragged into it?

394
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,104
Do you know…

395
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,224
why I do the plant trimming by myself?

396
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,120
If we don’t trim rotten branches,

397
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,344
it will slow down the plant’s growth.

398
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,360
The sooner we can get rid of the rotten branches,

399
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
the plant will not only look pretty,

400
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,056
but it will also grow faster.

401
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,728
The person who taught me this,

402
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,456
it’s your father.

403
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,696
Now you can see, right?

404
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,960
In your father’s eyes,

405
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,736
who were the rotten branches.

406
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,904
That’s the brat I told you about.

407
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,400
That brat who hit you the other day?

408
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,584
I was the one who hit her.

409
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,890
That’s not what I heard.

410
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
Stop it.

411
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Damn.

412
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:58,088
I hate her so much.

413
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,224
I want to hit her again.

414
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,248
How about this?

415
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
I have a plan.

416
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,624
Can I sit with you?

417
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
No.

418
00:34:16,816 --> 00:34:17,944
I’m waiting for my friends.

419
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,640
But I’ve seen you sitting alone for some time.

420
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,640
Your friends probably stood you up.

421
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,944
Why don’t you let us join you?

422
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:26,456
I want to be alone.

423
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,460
I see.

424
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,128
What are you doing?

425
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,830
What the hell are you doing?

426
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,770
Calm down.

427
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,352
I’m just joking.

428
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,120
It’s not a big deal.

429
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:43,864
Go away.

430
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
Leave me alone.

431
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,752
Fine.

432
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:46,904
If that’s what you want.

433
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:49,217
You think you can play hard to get
because you are pretty?

434
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Let’s go.

435
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,344
Chom.

436
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,416
Run.

437
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,816
Hi, Chompoo.

438
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,010
Sarah.

439
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,032
What are you doing here?

440
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,192
I have a gift for you.

441
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,920
I guarantee you will love it.

442
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:55,568
Because it’s just like in your video.

443
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,048
What the hell do you mean?

444
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,816
You should come with me.

445
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,140
Hey.

446
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Let me go.

447
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,090
Come here.

448
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,890
Let me go.

449
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,810
Let me go.

450
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,192
Let me go.

451
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:22,728
It’s just a joke.

452
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,160
I watched your video.

453
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,160
I know what you like.

454
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,992
I don’t like you, douchebag.

455
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,848
Let me go.

456
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,768
Why don’t you tell me you like it rough?

457
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,792
Stop playing hard to get.

458
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,368
I know you are easy.

459
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,928
Tomorrow, when you see the video,

460
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:49,392
you will thank me.

461
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,872
You, jerks.

462
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,370
Get off me.

463
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
Are you going to let yourself
be beaten down again?

464
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,552
Are you going to continue to be a victim?

465
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:20,340
I’m jealous of you.

466
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,448
It’s not because of Nathat.

467
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,880
It’s not because you’re pretty.

468
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,760
It’s because among us,
you have the strongest fighting spirit.

469
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,624
You are the person I look up to the most.

470
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,600
TO MY SISTER, YOU’RE THE MOST RESILIENT,
THE BEST AND THE STRONGEST.

471
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
My phone.

472
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,152
Don’t step over someone when they’re down.

473
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,488
We should beat them up instead.

474
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:09,960
I shouldn’t come here.

475
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,512
But you came.

476
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,768
That’s because you said…

477
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,856
you have useful information for the investigation.

478
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,208
You know this is dangerous.

479
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,810
What do you want for your drink?

480
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,872
I came here for work.

481
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,448
I don’t drink while I’m working.

482
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,608
Then I’ll drink for you.

483
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,184
Do you remember?

484
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,952
I told you about the dream I had
when I almost got hit by a truck.

485
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,760
It’s the dream I forgot for a long time.

486
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,576
I always thought
it was a scene from a movie I saw.

487
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,184
Or it was just my imagination.

488
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,576
Help.

489
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,580
Pi, help me.

490
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,208
I curse you.

491
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,816
You all will burn in hell.

492
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,144
I repeatedly had this dream.

493
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,592
I remember every word,

494
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,584
those vulgar words.

495
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,312
The curse,

496
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,096
that my family will all burn in hell.

497
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,144
You know it, right?

498
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,912
I can’t use your dream as evidence.

499
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:04,390
It might not be just a dream.

500
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,640
It might be something that I witnessed.

501
00:41:18,672 --> 00:41:20,008
Chom.

502
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,792
What are you doing here?

503
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
Hold on.

504
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,088
You are drunk.

505
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,540
You’ve had a crush on Chat for all this time.

506
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,368
Let’s think that I were Chat.

507
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,520
Can you help me forget everything?

508
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:56,920
(My sister probably doesn’t go anywhere.)

509
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,880
(Her existence has clearly been on our minds.)

510
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,888
(She blends in to be a part of our minds.)

511
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
(We now can’t tell…)

512
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,608
(who is the real demon here.)

513
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,304
(Who knows?)

514
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
(The world we are living in right now, )

515
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,448
(it’s hell...)

516
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,536
(from the beginning.)

517
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,552
What are you doing?

518
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,832
I always thought you had a crush on Chatfah.

519
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,408
You are the only one I can talk to.

520
00:42:51,432 --> 00:42:53,552
Because you are the only one I can trust.

521
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:54,664
Are you saying

522
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,584
Bua killed Uncle Kajorn and ran away?

523
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,464
On the night that Chatfah fell down,

524
00:43:00,504 --> 00:43:03,344
she asked us who killed our mom?
