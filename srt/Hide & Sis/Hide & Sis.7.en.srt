1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930
I thought you liked Chatfah all along.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,980
But people can always have a change of heart, right?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,900
Is the Mom we love so much

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,430
the Mom we really know?

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,030
The reason why Mom did that,

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,930
no one knows it, right?

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,760
No.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,550
No one knows,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,640
or no one wants to talk about it?

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,700
What are you trying to say?

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,180
No one wants to talk about it.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,620
Because they are scared.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,070
They are scared that we can’t handle the truth.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,770
They are scared that it will tear our family apart.

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,340
But Chatfah,

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,620
she is the only one
who has been searching for the truth.

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,980
What happened?

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,150
It fell down.

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,720
The window is old.

20
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,110
The hinges are probably old and broken.

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,250
It’s fortunate that you are safe.

22
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,650
I’ll call a handyman to fix it.

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Yes.

24
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,020
(There are only two things…)

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,770
(that can revive the heartbeats of a dead man.)

26
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,930
If we stood at a slightly different spot,

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,280
we would have needed a major face job.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,210
This is scary.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,560
(The first thing is soul-nourishing love)

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,890
Chom.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,580
Huh?

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,190
The hinges are not old like Aunty Chom said.

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,430
(The other is an implacable grudge.)

34
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,620
You should go wait inside.

35
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,680
It’s hot out here.

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,010
It’s okay.

37
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,850
Why do people need to kill one another?

38
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,180
It’s useless to think about it.

39
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
We will never know the answer

40
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,360
until we find the murderer.

41
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,770
Here.

42
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
Thank you.

43
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,390
I can’t contact her by phone.

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,740
Is this Bua’s phone?

45
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,420
We found it in her room.

46
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,550
Chom.

47
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,580
Bua didn’t take her phone with her?

48
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,780
She usually glues to her phone.

49
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,160
There’s no way she would leave it behind.

50
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,980
She might be in a hurry and forget it.

51
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,830
Or she could be kidnapped.

52
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,980
It’s my manager.

53
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,890
It’s probably about the news.

54
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,750
I need to take this call.

55
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,490
We need to reexamine the crime scene,

56
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,310
and question everyone.

57
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,100
What should I say?

58
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,540
I was with you last night.

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,910
Just tell them the truth.

60
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,970
Because that is what happened.

61
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,690
How can I tell them that?

62
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,140
You said we shouldn’t meet like that.

63
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,270
It’s better for me to face punishment
than for you to become a suspect.

64
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
It’s okay.

65
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Don’t worry.

66
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,720
Hello.

67
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,380
(Did you hear about Sarah?)

68
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,250
What about her?

69
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,620
(I couldn’t contact her.)

70
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,870
(I just found out today.)

71
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
(She is dead.)

72
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,140
When was the last time you saw your uncle?

73
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,080
I think it was a few days ago.

74
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,100
Or maybe longer than that.

75
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,970
I don’t really remember.

76
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,190
Do you know if he had any enemies?

77
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,040
I…

78
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
I don’t know.

79
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,310
Is it true that your sister was at odds with him?

80
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,580
I don’t know much about
what happened in the company.

81
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,490
On the night of the murder,

82
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,940
where were you and who were you with?

83
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,770
I…

84
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Miss. Miss.

85
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,650
Miss.

86
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
Yes.

87
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,580
I know that you are still shocked about
what happened to your uncle and sister.

88
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,000
But I need you to pay attention
and answer my questions.

89
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Yes, I get it.

90
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,520
I’ll answer your questions.

91
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,110
On the night of the murder,

92
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,140
where were you and who were you with?

93
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,790
Fire!

94
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Miss.

95
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,910
Are you Sarah’s friend?

96
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,410
Yes.

97
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,530
We were under the same agency.

98
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,930
Thank you for coming.

99
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,170
Sarah would be happy to know
that her friend came to bid her farewell.

100
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,740
Please go take a seat.

101
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,430
You can sit over there.

102
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,340
Hello. Are you Miss Sarah’s mother?

103
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,220
Yes.

104
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,360
Hello.

105
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,130
We believe that she was very drunk.

106
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,290
When the fire broke out,
she couldn’t escape from the nightclub.

107
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,370
We still don’t know the cause of the fire.

108
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,430
All the CCTV cameras in the club
were damaged by the fire.

109
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,410
Her friends are still in a coma.

110
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,790
They can’t give us any statement.

111
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Yes.

112
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,400
But there’s a camera
at the parking lot across the nightclub.

113
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,830
It captured the accident and the people
who went in and out of the nightclub.

114
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,780
We are requesting the footage from the camera.

115
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,570
This is not the first time
fire has broken out at a nightclub.

116
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,860
To be honest,

117
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,330
it’s not easy to find the cause of the fire.

118
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,730
There are several cases where we can’t find
the cause of the fire or arrest the culprits.

119
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Have you ever heard about the fire
at the nightclub called Hide & Seek?

120
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,470
Excuse me.

121
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,990
Yes. How can I help you?

122
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,840
I…

123
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,260
Last night, I parked my car here.

124
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,470
My belongings went missing.

125
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,100
Can I see the footage from the camera?

126
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,590
Yes, but you need to have a police report.

127
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,040
Otherwise, I can’t let you see it.

128
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,950
I need a police report?

129
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,500
Yes, or you can use an incident report.

130
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,980
Otherwise, we can’t show it to you.

131
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,290
Okay. Thank you.

132
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,570
It’s okay.

133
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Chom.

134
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,640
When did you get in?

135
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,540
A while ago.

136
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,010
You were sleeping.

137
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,200
I didn’t want to wake you up.

138
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,680
So…

139
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,330
why are you crying?

140
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,760
Sarah.

141
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
She is dead.

142
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,170
On the night when the nightclub caught fire,

143
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
she couldn’t escape.

144
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,080
I don’t know what to do.

145
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,760
So many things happened to me.

146
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,760
Uncle Kajorn is dead.

147
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Bua is missing.

148
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,250
The house I grew up in
became an unfamiliar place.

149
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,190
But I am your alibi.

150
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,160
You were with me that night.

151
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,980
That’s not all.

152
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,840
There’s a CCTV camera
in front of the nightclub.

153
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,980
Police will find out that I was there that night.

154
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,910
How about this?

155
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
You just tell them the truth.

156
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,930
You did that as self-defense.

157
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,960
No one would believe me.

158
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,980
Everyone believes what they want to believe.

159
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,770
What the truth really is,

160
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,110
no one cares.

161
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,156
2022
How are you feeling, Chompoo?

162
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,250
Are you nervous?

163
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Yes.

164
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,400
It’s okay. Just relax.

165
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,820
You practiced it several times.

166
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,650
Alright.

167
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,940
Everyone, please stand by.

168
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,380
We are going live in 30 seconds.

169
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,180
I’m rooting for you.

170
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,020
You can do it.

171
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,340
Thank you.

172
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,060
Everyone, ready.

173
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,160
Five, four, three, two, live.

174
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,570
Welcome to the hourly news updates.

175
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,190
Sitting with me is a trainee news anchor.

176
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,600
She is the winner
of our station’s news anchor contest.

177
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,880
Hello. I’m Chompoonuch Bupphachinda.

178
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,100
Let’s check out today’s weather forecast.

179
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,300
The weather forecast from
the meteorological department on 30 August.

180
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,740
Rain is expected across the country.

181
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,660
It may cause torrential and flash floods.

182
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,190
For the news updates,
police raided a well-known model agency.

183
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,140
The model agent lured aspiring artists
to have sexual intercourse,

184
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,510
and secretly recorded videos to blackmail them.

185
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,570
He was arrested earlier this morning.

186
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,100
Police found dozens of videos of the victims.

187
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,060
Some of the videos
are spreading on the internet.

188
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,990
The agency is owned by Mr. Pongpiti,
also known as Pong.

189
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,020
Stop the video and go to the commercial break.

190
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,280
Turn it off.

191
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,570
2016

192
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,060
Hello.

193
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,010
I’m sorry for being late.

194
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,710
I remember all my lines.

195
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,170
I’m ready for the audition.

196
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,370
I’m going to tell you
that you don’t need to come in anymore.

197
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,110
Why?

198
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,220
Good. I really like it.

199
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,310
I’m glad to work with you.

200
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,220
I want to work with new faces.

201
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,420
You give a fresh look.

202
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,740
Well done, Chatfah.

203
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,590
Thank you for giving me the chance.

204
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,160
I’m a rookie.

205
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,230
If you have any advice,
please feel free to tell me.

206
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,890
Good.

207
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,270
Chom, this way.

208
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,570
Pong, this is my sister.

209
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,030
She is single.

210
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,240
Right.

211
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,060
Chompoo, what do you want to drink?

212
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,370
I’ll order it for you.

213
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,180
I’ll have what Chat has.

214
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,730
Okay.

215
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,790
This is the important thing you want to tell me?

216
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,580
He’s a model agent.

217
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,980
I met him when I auditioned for a commercial.

218
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,880
He is good-looking and nice.

219
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,190
He saw you on my Instagram
and wanted to ask you out.

220
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,380
But…

221
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,860
he’s too old for me.

222
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,840
I don’t want to date anyone right now.

223
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Just give it a chance and get to know him.

224
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,750
If you don’t like him, you can block him.

225
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,100
I think he is mature.

226
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,260
He can protect you.

227
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,540
2022
How could you play the video?

228
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,380
Don’t you see that the woman in the video
is the same person as the news anchor?

229
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,350
I’m sorry.

230
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,760
I didn’t know they were the same woman.

231
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,330
In the video, she looks very young.

232
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,380
I didn’t recognize her.

233
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,600
But I already blurred her face.

234
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,300
Blurred her face, and what?

235
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,510
Netizens will find out who she is.

236
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,030
Delete the video.

237
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,380
We cannot let the station’s reputation
be ruined more than it already did.

238
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,260
Yes.

239
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,290
You.

240
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,410
I heard that you are Nathat’s friend.

241
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Yes.

242
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,940
Did you win the contest
because of Nathat’s connections?

243
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,290
No.

244
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,770
He has nothing to do with it.

245
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,030
He didn’t know that I joined the contest.

246
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,540
People start digging.

247
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,850
They think you got into this round

248
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,140
because you’re my grandson’s girlfriend.

249
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,560
I admit that I am the woman in the video.

250
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,670
I didn’t know that he was filming me.

251
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,180
If you didn’t give him a green light,
how could he film it?

252
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,540
I was young.

253
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
I thought he did that because he loved me.

254
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,780
I didn’t know that it would turn out like this.

255
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,740
Your behavior is a breach of contract.

256
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,560
You ruin our company’s reputation.

257
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,390
I will not sue you,

258
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,670
if you stay away from my grandson.

259
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,580
In reality,

260
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,540
people judge others based on what they believe.

261
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,580
If they judge you from what they see,

262
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,120
then we don’t let them see anything.

263
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,970
This is the statement of the members of
the Bupphachinda on the night Kajorn was killed.

264
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,190
Read it yourself.

265
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,660
If you have anything to ask me,

266
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,010
just say it.

267
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,500
If you have anything you want to tell me,
just say it.

268
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,410
Okay.

269
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,480
I’m going to tell you that…

270
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,740
I did that to investigate the case.

271
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,210
What else?

272
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
I have no hidden agenda.

273
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
I swear.

274
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,160
With the middle sister?

275
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,230
If you swore on your life, you would be dead.

276
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,100
I told you everything.

277
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Why?

278
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,960
Are you going to question me, too?

279
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:39,096
If you were involved with the case,

280
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:40,440
I wanted to question you.

281
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,088
But she didn’t mention your name
in the interrogation.

282
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,352
She said she was working at the office until late.

283
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,176
But she has no witness to confirm it.

284
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:56,912
So I’m going to check CCTV cameras
at her office.

285
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:58,320
Are you going with me?

286
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,328
Go with me.

287
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,944
Have you ever seen these two women?

288
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:05,992
No.

289
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,248
If you see them, please contact me.

290
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,184
Thank you.

291
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:10,216
Sure.

292
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:21,504
If you see them, please contact me.

293
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:23,928
If you are interested, please call me.

294
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,872
Have you ever seen these women?

295
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you.

296
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,392
- If you see them, please contact me.
- Thank you.

297
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,776
Excuse me.

298
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,384
Have you ever seen these women?

299
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,568
If you see them, please contact me.

300
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,860
I have a meeting with a realtor
to discuss my grandma’s land deal.

301
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:53,824
Your grandma has been wanting
to buy the land for some time.

302
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,672
Chat told me about it.

303
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,472
I don’t want to only wait for their news.

304
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,872
I want to do something.

305
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,240
So I came to ask the local people here.

306
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,728
You did the right thing.

307
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,984
I’m sorry.

308
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,744
I didn’t do anything to help you.

309
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,752
There’s something…

310
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,256
I never understand.

311
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,544
Why both Chom and Chat…

312
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,144
fell in love with you?

313
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,584
When I see you living your life
like nothing happened,

314
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:42,460
while Chat is still missing,

315
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:45,580
Chom is going through a tough time.

316
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,952
To tell you the truth,

317
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,592
in my eyes,

318
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,664
I feel really bad for them.

319
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,728
They were fighting for you.

320
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,944
You were not me.

321
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,576
You would never understand what I went through.

322
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,192
What about my sisters?

323
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,856
Do you know what they are going through?

324
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,984
You might be the cause
of everything that happened.

325
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,952
But you pretend like nothing happened.

326
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,104
My sisters did so much for you.

327
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,048
You love your family.

328
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:27,050
So do I.

329
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,920
So this is my sisters’ fault?

330
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:33,160
Because they love you?

331
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,928
You were at Bupphachat Mansion that night, weren’t you?

332
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,872
Chom didn’t tell me.

333
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,280
It’s my speculation.

334
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,256
Why?

335
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,960
Why did you let Chom
go through everything alone?

336
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,352
The pain…

337
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
from finding out that you slept with Chat.

338
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,576
Even today.

339
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,144
Even right now.

340
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,472
You still leave her to fight through it alone.

341
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:14,336
You don’t understand me.

342
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,776
I want to be with Chom.

343
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:18,288
I want to take care of her.

344
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,904
But I can’t do that.

345
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,064
You should be there for her the most,
but you can’t do it.

346
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,544
Then there’s no one else who can do it.

347
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,136
Chatfah has a video from Chompoo’s birthday.

348
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,696
The birthday at the nightclub.

349
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,888
She has the video that recorded everything.

350
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,096
Get up and drink.

351
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,104
This is boring.

352
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,064
Hey.

353
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:57,176
She’s here.

354
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,600
Why are you late?

355
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:03,272
This is my birthday.

356
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:04,248
I’m sorry.

357
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,384
I went to have dinner with my friends.

358
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:07,592
I’m mad.

359
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,224
Don’t be mad.

360
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:12,384
Where is the cake?

361
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Cake?

362
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,496
I asked a staff member to keep it in the fridge.

363
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,832
I’ll get it at midnight.

364
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,584
Okay.

365
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:19,616
Here.

366
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,760
Because you are late.

367
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
Drink it.

368
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,712
Okay.

369
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:25,744
Well done.

370
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,024
Chom.

371
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,856
Why are you this drunk?

372
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:36,896
No, I’m not.

373
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,608
She had this.

374
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
What is it?

375
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Come on.

376
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:47,264
Trust me.

377
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:04,784
Girls.

378
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,064
Bua and Dad are not here to keep an eye on us.

379
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:09,864
Let’s get wasted tonight.

380
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,264
Chom.

381
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:12,512
Cheers.

382
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:14,376
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

383
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Come here.

384
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Have a seat.

385
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,280
I need another drink.

386
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,520
That’s enough.

387
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,424
Stop drinking.

388
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,944
Why are you drinking so much?

389
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,940
I went to throw up and get it all out.

390
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,480
I came here like a queen,
but will go back like a hot mess.

391
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,856
Yes, you are a mess.

392
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,168
Look at you.

393
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,048
I’m not drunk.

394
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:50,608
We can’t have another round of drinks.

395
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,344
It’s midnight.

396
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,032
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

397
00:26:58,064 --> 00:27:01,592
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

398
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:03,320
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

399
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,384
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

400
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,380
Look at me.

401
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,024
I’ll make a wish.

402
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,270
Police are here.

403
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,160
Girls, let’s go.

404
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Come on.

405
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,032
What should we do?

406
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:37,990
Should we go out and act normal?

407
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,576
Look at us.

408
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,580
If we walk out,
they will send us for a drug test.

409
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,232
No.

410
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,752
Dad cannot know about this.

411
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,560
Chat is a minor.

412
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,296
I bribed a bouncer to get her in.

413
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,176
The lighter.

414
00:27:57,272 --> 00:27:57,648
Huh?

415
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,304
Give me the lighter.

416
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:10,820
Chom, are you going to…

417
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,464
Just make a small fire to help us escape.

418
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:15,008
They can put it out before it spreads.

419
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,152
You can’t do that.

420
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:18,736
What if the fire spread?

421
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,184
What else do you want me to do?

422
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:22,440
You want us to be arrested?

423
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:23,616
Dad will kill me.

424
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:25,024
Dad will kill us.

425
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:25,808
I can’t let that happen.

426
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,000
Chom, calm down.

427
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,376
I think we can find another way.

428
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,056
Please, don’t do it.

429
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:30,848
It’s dangerous.

430
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:32,850
There’s no other way.

431
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,920
No, Chom.

432
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:35,968
There must be other ways.

433
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:37,970
Calm down and think.

434
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,552
We can find another way.

435
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:40,664
Please don’t do it.

436
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:41,664
Trust me.

437
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:42,928
They can put out the fire.

438
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,456
Chom, I’m begging you.

439
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:45,832
There must be another way.

440
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,848
Police are investigating the cause of the fire at Hide & Seek, a famous nightclub in Thonglor.

441
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:17,872
Around midnight yesterday,
police raided the nightclub.

442
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:20,696
The fire broke out at the back of the building.

443
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:24,224
Police believe that the fire started…

444
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Chat.

445
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,592
Aren’t we going to talk about this?

446
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,368
Why do we need to talk about it?

447
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,728
It has nothing to do with us.

448
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,552
How can you say that? We…

449
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:40,568
So what?

450
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:43,060
Can you handle the punishment?

451
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,480
We could go to jail.

452
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:47,480
Dad might cut us off.

453
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,368
You might feel guilty now.

454
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,624
But you’ll be too scared
to face the punishment.

455
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,552
Since none of us can handle it.

456
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,550
There’s no point in talking about it.

457
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,416
What happened last night.

458
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,400
We were just those who were affected by it.

459
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,896
We were victims.

460
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,456
We didn’t start it.

461
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,520
Are you saying you marry Chat…

462
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,208
not because she said she was pregnant,

463
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,528
but because she used that video to threaten you?

464
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,190
I never slept with her.

465
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:32,050
Why did she do that?

466
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,440
She was there when the video was taken.

467
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:39,180
Why did she use it to threaten you?

468
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,800
The latter part of the video
didn’t capture what happened.

469
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,256
Because Chat put her phone in her pocket.

470
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,272
Only your conversation was recorded.

471
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,056
Most of the conversation is about

472
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:54,140
Chompoo saying she was going to do it.

473
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,552
Based on the conversation,

474
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,736
it sounded like she set the fire.

475
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,576
But…

476
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,296
Chat shouldn’t risk her life like this.

477
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,632
Picha, don’t you see?

478
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:15,060
Picha turned into someone who had no fear.

479
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,776
To get what she wants,

480
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:21,040
even if she needs to hurt herself,

481
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,416
she’s willing to do it.

482
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,600
Then why does she want to marry you?

483
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,544
Look at everything she did.

484
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,496
I don’t think
you are the only thing that she wanted.

485
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,776
I don’t know.

486
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,592
For me,

487
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,330
Chat went missing.

488
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,020
It could be a good thing.

489
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,248
I deleted the footage
from the camera at my office.

490
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,744
If police ask for it,

491
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,544
I’ll tell them that the camera is broken.

492
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,620
So there’ll be no proof that I lied.

493
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,472
Why did you lie?

494
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,000
Because you shouldn’t be dragged into this.

495
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,456
This is not the only thing I lied about.

496
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,336
I lied about that night, too.

497
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,304
The night that Chatfah went missing.

498
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,872
The truth is…

499
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,400
I went to see her that night.

500
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,864
She said…

501
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,688
if I told her who killed our mom,

502
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,160
she would give me some of the inheritance.

503
00:33:16,832 --> 00:33:18,830
But I didn’t know who killed our mom.

504
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,736
Because I really wanted the house.

505
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,048
I went to see her in her room.

506
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,576
When I went in,

507
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,432
she was not in the room.

508
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,730
When Chatfah fell down,

509
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,984
I went to my room
to get a towel to slow her bleeding.

510
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:49,584
But I also deleted the message
saying I was going to meet her.

511
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,928
I didn’t want anyone to know…

512
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,128
how desperately I wanted the house,

513
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,112
how much I loved it,

514
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,392
and how attached I felt to it.

515
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,648
But I couldn’t unlock her phone.

516
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,448
So I hid her phone under the bed.

517
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,168
Then I would delete the message later.

518
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,170
The phone went missing.

519
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,488
All this time,

520
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,952
I’ve been living in fear.

521
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,472
I started by lying about small things.

522
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,384
Now, the lie is getting out of hand.

523
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,380
I’ve been thinking this.

524
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,704
If I weren’t worried about Chaftah’s phone,

525
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,688
and I stayed with her,

526
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,048
she wouldn’t go missing.

527
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,648
Things wouldn’t get out of hand like this.

528
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,912
I know.

529
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,232
I know how pathetic I am.

530
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,464
I was very selfish, right?

531
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,192
Stop blaming yourself.

532
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,824
All you need to do is tell the truth to the police.

533
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,912
The truth is…

534
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,064
I now realize…

535
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,440
that we all…

536
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,376
we’ve been trying to hide our wrongdoings.

537
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:09,070
We started to attack each other,

538
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,400
and betray each other.

539
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,472
Now, things are falling apart.

540
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,624
But I’m tired of it.

541
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
I want to end it.

542
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,672
I told you the truth.

543
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,872
Because among all the people that I know,

544
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,400
You are the last person
I want to misunderstand me.

545
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,736
At least,

546
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,168
I want you to see that
I still have something good in me.

547
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,040
I’ll tell everything to the police tomorrow.

548
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,320
Don’t worry.

549
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I won’t mention your name.

550
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,424
I don’t want you to get into trouble
because of me.

551
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,176
Everything that you said,

552
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,064
do you really mean it?

553
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:47,460
Or are you just trying to manipulate me?

554
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,976
Why would I do that?

555
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,790
I don’t know.

556
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,472
Maybe because you want me
to help you with the case?

557
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,840
Or you are just having fun because…

558
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,760
you know how I feel about you.

559
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,104
Do you think I’m having fun?

560
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,416
I have to hide everything when I’m with you.

561
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,336
Your job is to investigate me.

562
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,408
You are the one
I should stay away from the most.

563
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,152
But I don’t know why.

564
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,928
Every time I turn back, I always see you.

565
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,768
The person who is manipulative is you.

566
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,408
You’ve been suspecting me.

567
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,912
Why are you pretending to worry about me?

568
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,630
Wait.

569
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,000
I am not pretending.

570
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,304
You are good at painting.

571
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,448
I’m making a living out of it.

572
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,784
Why don’t you send your work
to sell at a big gallery?

573
00:40:05,976 --> 00:40:08,352
Or why don’t you hold an exhibition?

574
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,984
With your skill,
any gallery will want your work.

575
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,512
I don’t like to be around people.

576
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,496
I like to work on my painting alone.

577
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,120
I like being alone.

578
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,968
Then why did you jump into this chaos?

579
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,970
I…

580
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,792
I want to know…

581
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,040
how great the power of love is.

582
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,032
What do you mean?

583
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,800
You lied to the police.

584
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,780
You took the risk of being arrested.

585
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,584
You did everything for the man you love.

586
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:09,040
I just want to know…

587
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,272
how long you will keep going.

588
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,904
I think you already got the answer.

589
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Love is not that great.

590
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,576
I think it was just my foolishness.

591
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,392
When it comes to love,

592
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,912
one of us is usually more foolish than the other.

593
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,344
If you call it foolishness,

594
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,384
It must be a great foolishness.

595
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,168
I think…

596
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,264
it’s not everyone

597
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,384
that can do great things

598
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,200
such as sacrificing themselves

599
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,872
to help someone.

600
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,056
I’m sorry.

601
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,488
It’s okay.

602
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,280
I’ll clean it up.

603
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Sorry.

604
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,976
Did I wake you up?

605
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,540
No.

606
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,230
You didn’t.

607
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,640
I thought you already went to the police station.

608
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,248
I plan to go there today.

609
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,912
This case has too many secrets.

610
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,344
If you have to mention my name,

611
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,608
just do it.

612
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,320
I told you.

613
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:45,528
I won’t get you into trouble.

614
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,544
But I don’t want you to go through this alone.

615
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,088
I believe in the justice system.

616
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,136
It is fair for us all.

617
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,592
But justice also means we need to face
the consequences of our actions, right?

618
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,560
Yes, what’s up?

619
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,544
We found a signal from Chatfah’s phone.

620
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,272
Her phone is turned on.

621
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,568
Her phone is turned on?

622
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:05,440
Yes.

623
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:07,024
Chain and I are going to check it.

624
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,968
From the location,

625
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,970
I don’t know how it got there.

626
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,032
I want to go with you.

627
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,616
You should wait here.

628
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,344
I’ll keep you posted.

629
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,032
I’ll be right back.

630
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,696
I’m on my way.

631
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,448
You don’t need to go.

632
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,160
Team B will go there.

633
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,968
What do you mean?

634
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,424
I heard that you were dismissed from the case.

635
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,184
(Turn weakness into rage.)

636
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,136
(Turn foolishness…)

637
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,408
(into courage.)

638
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,584
(Even smart people can do foolish things)

639
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:44,610
(Even though it is dangerous, )

640
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,408
(we still try our best to get it.)

641
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,120
(Even in the end, )

642
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,664
(it doesn’t worth it at all.)

643
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,736
Chom.

644
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,760
Chompoo.

645
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,504
Bua, if you can’t set a good example for your sister,

646
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:42,144
they won’t listen to you.

647
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:45,088
Someone put Chatfah’s phone in my case.

648
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,904
Then place it in my room.

649
00:48:47,312 --> 00:48:49,280
Someone tries to frame me.

650
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,248
Just make her disappear, right?

651
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:52,944
Let me go.

652
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:55,168
Now, I remember who it is.

653
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:57,552
I didn’t expect that person would be this sister of yours.
