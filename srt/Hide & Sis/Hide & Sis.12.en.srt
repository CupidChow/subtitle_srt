1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,536
The dead body in the well

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,136
I think she was murdered by my father.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,584
It was not an accident.

4
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:14,860
You killed Chat, didn’t you?

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,608
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,568
I asked

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,936
whether you were the one who killed Chat.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,056
(If this world is a competition, )

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,392
(the law must be the rule that sets the boundaries.)

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,030
Answer me.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,936
It wasn’t a hard question.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,856
You killed Chat, right?

13
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:45,552
What do you mean?

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,270
There.

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,144
That was you, Parn.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,320
And that night at the bar,

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,576
the one who pretended to be Chat

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,288
and talked me into jumping off and killing myself,

19
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,376
that was you, right?

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,208
Why are you doing this?

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Huh?

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,128
(The role of the players is to pretend)

23
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,616
(that they’re playing by the rules.)

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
(But have a double cross prepared deep down.)

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,792
I was mistaken and thought

26
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,936
that Chat might still be alive.

27
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,864
Now I understand.

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,800
Everything happened because

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,888
someone has been pretending to be Chat.

30
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,400
To fool me and my sisters.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,984
To play with our heads.

32
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,768
And that person is you.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,552
Why would I do that?

34
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,584
I love Chat.

35
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,584
I love you guys like my real sisters.

36
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:40,792
Come on!

37
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,720
Stop being overoptimistic for once.

38
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:44,384
I feel like throwing up.

39
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,416
It’s fake right from when you said
Chat was a good person.

40
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:48,352
You can be staring down from Pluto

41
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:49,952
and still figure that it’s a pretense.

42
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,992
Why would I lie to you guys?

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,696
Even when no one says it,

44
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,824
but everyone knows.

45
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,768
That you’re the one

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,664
who probably hates us the most.

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,536
(Because in this game, )

48
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:17,576
(the one at fault might not be the loser.)

49
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,768
(But the winner)

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,696
(for faking it best in front of the judges.)

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,120
I’m here.

52
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:40,144
Where are you?

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,512
Come on in.

54
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:42,752
The innermost table.

55
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,152
Come right in.

56
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:45,904
The innermost table…

57
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,608
Found it!

58
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,640
You look all pretty!

59
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,144
I was casting for a series

60
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,848
and came right after I finished.

61
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:01,752
Happy birthday, Chom.

62
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:02,776
Thank you.

63
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,168
So how was it?

64
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,536
What did they say?

65
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,264
They already told me the result.

66
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,976
They said I got the job!

67
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,256
Then we have to celebrate.

68
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,450
Come here.

69
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:15,208
Bottoms up!

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,210
Bottoms up!

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,552
Because that night…

72
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,488
You were angry, right?

73
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,560
That we escaped,

74
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,272
but you almost couldn’t make it out alive.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,136
Run, everyone!

76
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:52,168
Run!

77
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,936
Chom!

78
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,808
Where did you guys go?

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Chat!

80
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,248
I know

81
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,752
that you wanted to become an actress.

82
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,976
You wanted to work in entertainment
like me or Chat.

83
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,672
But because of the fire that night,

84
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,260
it ruined your dreams.

85
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,896
So you are bitter at us.

86
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,192
Did I get it right?

87
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:44,328
Do you

88
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,264
really think

89
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,472
I hate you because of that?

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,968
Even now, I can’t even go wherever I want.

91
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,584
I can’t even do that!

92
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,056
So how would I have killed Chatfah?

93
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,960
How would I have done it?

94
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,048
You really can’t walk, right?

95
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,150
Yes.

96
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:40,440
Chom!

97
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,544
What are you going to do?

98
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:42,504
What are you doing to me?

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,264
Chom!

100
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:44,304
Chom!

101
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,192
Chompoo, what are you doing?

102
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:48,328
Chompoo!

103
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,360
Chompoo?

104
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,592
Chompoo, don’t do it!

105
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:53,200
Chompoo!

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Chompoo!

107
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,408
Chompoo, what are you about to do?

108
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,488
I’ll try it out and see

109
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
whether your legs really don’t work.

110
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,296
Don’t do it!

111
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,168
Why did you do this to me?

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,968
That can’t be it.

113
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,184
You must be the one who killed Chat.

114
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,952
I didn’t kill her!

115
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:44,980
I didn’t kill Chat.

116
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,744
I love Chat.

117
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,704
I love her so much.

118
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,592
Without her, I could have been dead.

119
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,950
Wait!

120
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,672
What?

121
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:58,056
Where is Parn?

122
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,104
Parn?

123
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,984
She might have run away already.

124
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,648
F*ck. Let’s go!

125
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,528
Hurry up, Chat!

126
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:05,944
Hey, Chat!

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Chat!

128
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:14,272
Parn!

129
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
Parn!

130
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,270
Parn!

131
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,176
Parn, Parn, Parn!

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Parn!

133
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Parn!

134
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
I owe a lot to Chat.

135
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,616
If Chat hadn’t gone back to save me that day,

136
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:48,248
I wouldn’t have survived to this day.

137
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,880
I’m so sorry.

138
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:58,760
I’m sorry.

139
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,248
I have never thought

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,544
you would see me as someone insincere.

141
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:07,300
I was never angry at you guys

142
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,300
for having escaped first.

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,776
I’m even thankful

144
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,190
that after Chat helped me out,

145
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,824
you guys brought me to the hospital in time.

146
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,280
Otherwise, I would have been dead.

147
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,832
I’m sorry.

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
What’s going on?

149
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,472
I was wheeling around carelessly.

150
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,184
So I fell down the stairs.

151
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:52,660
Chompoo wanted to help me

152
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,824
but she probably can’t handle it.

153
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,112
Would you mind taking me upstairs?

154
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,650
Sure.

155
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:22,460
The dead body in the well?

156
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Yes.

157
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,736
That area used to be a well.

158
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,584
But it was covered up after the incident.

159
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,016
And whose body was that?

160
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,368
Why do you say that person
is the cause of everything?

161
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,424
My memory of that woman is very hazy.

162
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,584
Because I was young.

163
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,528
But what I can remember clearly

164
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
is that she was a very kind woman.

165
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,432
Tell me,

166
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,992
how much money do you want?

167
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,760
I’m not agreeing to anything.

168
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,176
You also have a family.

169
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,276
Aren’t you afraid that one day,

170
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,312
your wife and kids would be in trouble

171
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:19,056
because you’re doing this kind of business?

172
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:26,530
I think we should talk about this inside.

173
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,288
I can’t be here.

174
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,552
I can’t pretend I don’t know about
what you’re doing.

175
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,960
Then what do you want me to do?

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
You don’t have to do anything.

177
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,672
I’ll be the one leaving.

178
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,848
That was the first time

179
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:41,710
that I saw that woman getting angry.

180
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,608
She normally smiled

181
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,420
and was always kind to me.

182
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,872
That was the last time I saw her.

183
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,176
Do you happen to remember who she was?

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,912
I can’t remember her name.

185
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,032
But from the memories that remain,

186
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,928
I think she was a worker at our farm

187
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,344
who happened to know my dad’s secret

188
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,490
and my dad was furious.

189
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,080
What did your father do wrong?

190
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,824
I don’t know either.

191
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,936
We were suspicious about it

192
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:21,590
but no one dared ask.

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,576
I think it’s time I admit the truth

194
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,568
that my family

195
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:31,864
have been hurting people around them

196
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,860
and even the people within the family all along.

197
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,408
Being born as their children

198
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,984
really hurts so much.

199
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,944
I don’t want to bear this feeling anymore.

200
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,208
I want to break free.

201
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
I used to want to be like my dad.

202
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,768
I wanted to be successful like him.

203
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,510
But I know now that

204
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,968
I don’t want to be like my dad.

205
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,776
When will you stop avoiding me?

206
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,176
Until I don’t have to see you again.

207
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:22,032
I’m sorry.

208
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,120
I can apologize to you
a thousand times over if you want

209
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,640
But it was because back then,

210
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:29,880
I wasn’t ready to throw away my life and my dream.

211
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:31,600
So you were willing to do anything

212
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:33,992
to get off the hook of being a suspect.

213
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,832
Admit it.

214
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,816
That you only love yourself.

215
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,888
Your family is so twisted.

216
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,192
You guys can do anything

217
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:49,752
just to get away with what you did.

218
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,584
You lied.

219
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,808
You used people.

220
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,224
You played with my head.

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,448
You can even hurt yourself.

222
00:13:58,488 --> 00:13:59,936
You can lie even to yourself

223
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,176
that you had to do it

224
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,976
for yourself.

225
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:06,728
Is this it?

226
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:09,170
The thoughts of the selfish rich people.

227
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,936
You can condemn me all you want.

228
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
But you can never understand

229
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,544
the kind of risks I had to face,

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that made me have to lie like this.

231
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,136
You’re saying your life was at risk

232
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,856
so you had to lie.

233
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,040
What about the lives of the others?

234
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,104
The lives of the others

235
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:34,784
who had to face the consequences of your lies.

236
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,424
Were they worthless?

237
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,384
You’re no different from your dad.

238
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,890
I’m sorry.

239
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,544
But I can’t love this kind of woman.

240
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,704
Hey!

241
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,856
Calm down!

242
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,792
I should have known.

243
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:13,560
Why would such a girl be interested in me?

244
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,312
Of course, she must have done it for something.

245
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,056
She might not have meant to do it.

246
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,976
But she had to do it to survive.

247
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,904
I also believe she hasn’t said everything.

248
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,992
Why?

249
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,296
What else do you think is there?

250
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,660
Do you remember that skeleton we found?

251
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,384
It was because the CCTV caught that man

252
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,584
looking like he was trying to dig up something, right?

253
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,864
What if he did it

254
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,640
for us to find the skeleton?

255
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,312
Could that be possible?

256
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:52,136
That man, the skeleton we found,

257
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:53,848
and Chatfah’s death.

258
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,720
Could it be possible that they’re all related?

259
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,808
And according to Picha’s testimony,

260
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,740
she said the skeleton might belong to

261
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:04,064
someone who used to work with her dad.

262
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,896
It was a story from a long time ago.

263
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:09,690
The workers who used to be there had all quit.

264
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,048
No one knew what happened.

265
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,616
Then aren’t we supposed to ask

266
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,776
from someone who had quit?

267
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,110
Yes.

268
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,200
I have the address of the previous manager
of the farm who had quit.

269
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Who’s that?

270
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,768
Her name is Fai.

271
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,568
Would you want to talk to her yourself?

272
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:47,664
This is murder.

273
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,200
Your dad intentionally killed my dad

274
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:53,392
to hide the secret.

275
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,752
Even if I were to say I understand you,

276
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,544
it wouldn’t make up to half of what you feel.

277
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,696
To hide all these f*cked up shits,

278
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,300
how many people did your dad have to kill?

279
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,450
Hmm?

280
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,056
You used to say

281
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:23,176
that your family is like it’s been cursed.

282
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,584
But even if your family
were to be cursed for 7 generations,

283
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,872
it still wouldn’t make up for what your dad did.

284
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,860
What you guys are going through

285
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,780
can’t even compare

286
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,880
to the f*cked up shits your dad did!

287
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,984
I know that

288
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,992
the word “sorry” might not be able to

289
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,704
make up for what happened.

290
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,144
But there’s really nothing else I can do.

291
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
I…

292
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,768
I’m sorry.

293
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,984
You know what?

294
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:49,660
I hate your dad so much right now.

295
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,168
Right now in my head,

296
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:56,680
there are only thoughts

297
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,736
about how to make your dad wretch.

298
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,980
To make your dad feel the pain

299
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,560
the way I do.

300
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:07,984
Do you know?

301
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,752
I hate myself so much

302
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,584
for not being able to do anything.

303
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,600
Right after all these things end,

304
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,576
I will leave you.

305
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,180
And I hope we never meet again.

306
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,768
I don’t believe you.

307
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,072
That you falling down the stairs was an accident.

308
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,872
But if you don’t want to talk about it,

309
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:02,000
then I won’t ask.

310
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,736
Can I ask you something?

311
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,460
Why did you become a police officer?

312
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,384
My dad was a policeman.

313
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,408
He also died in duty.

314
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,160
Back then, I didn’t know what my dream was

315
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,980
until I saw it at my dad’s funeral.

316
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,792
The way people will perceive you

317
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,248
when you do the right thing.

318
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,584
I want to get such compliments too.

319
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,960
But when you’re dead,

320
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
what would you do with those compliments?

321
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,664
That’s what set my dad and me apart.

322
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,640
I want to hear those compliments
when I’m still alive

323
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,632
so I became a police officer.

324
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I was just wondering

325
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,208
how it feels to achieve your dreams.

326
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,560
Ever since I was born,

327
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:11,968
I dare say that,

328
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,072
I’ve never achieved it.

329
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,810
My dream career,

330
00:21:18,184 --> 00:21:20,180
I’ve given that up long ago.

331
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,744
But the dream to live a peaceful life

332
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,360
with someone who truly loves me,

333
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,380
I don’t know why it’s so hard to achieve.

334
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,000
And now I have no one left.

335
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,720
I just want someone who stays by my side.

336
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,712
Is it too much to ask?

337
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:04,048
Oh!

338
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,984
What medicine is that?

339
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,592
It’s my medicine.

340
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,824
What is it for?

341
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,000
It’s not like the ones from the hospital.

342
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,328
And…

343
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,032
What brings you here?

344
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
The thing is…

345
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,280
I pushed Parn down the stairs.

346
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,816
Hear me out.

347
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,568
That night on the rooftop,

348
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,600
I saw someone impersonating Chatfah

349
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:22,064
and I almost caught who it was.

350
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,688
I scratched her arm

351
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,752
and Parn has a scratch like the one I made.

352
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,704
You weren’t just drunk and saw things, were you?

353
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,600
I thought I was drunk at first

354
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:37,328
but when I saw the scratch,

355
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:38,776
I believed I was right.

356
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,744
There was also the person
who sent the basket with a threat.

357
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,216
So you pushed her off the stairs

358
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,112
because you were wondering
if she was really disabled?

359
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,110
Yeah.

360
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,384
Are you out of your mind?

361
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Oh…

362
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,680
So how was it?

363
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,112
Was she pretending?

364
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,800
The thing is, she wasn’t.

365
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,048
She really couldn’t walk.

366
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,824
If I can’t find the one who killed Chat,

367
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,370
Nathat’s grandma won’t leave me alone.

368
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:28,768
You’re doing everything

369
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,420
to make Nathat’s grandma accept you

370
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:34,760
and believe that you’re not the murderer?

371
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Well…

372
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,624
I also want to find out who killed Chat.

373
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,440
So do you think

374
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:55,020
that after you’ve proven yourself,

375
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:58,390
Nathat’s grandma will accept you?

376
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,152
Actually,

377
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,856
Nathat was two-timing you from the start.

378
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,296
Nathat agreed to marry Chat

379
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,680
because she was blackmailing him.

380
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,064
That’s what he told you,

381
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,088
so you believed him?

382
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,368
Nathat and Chatfah were secretly seeing each other

383
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:41,260
even before you started getting to know Nathat.

384
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,752
That’s not true.

385
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,664
Chatfah didn’t steal Nathat from you.

386
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,344
But it was you

387
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,340
who stole Nathat from Chatfah.

388
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,096
You’re afraid that you’d lose your toy

389
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,792
so much that you have to say that?

390
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,520
You may say that.

391
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,192
I can do even worse.

392
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,504
I was wrong.

393
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,320
To think that you could be trusted.

394
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,352
What about Nathat?

395
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,616
How many times has he lied to you?

396
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:40,049
Yet you’re still stupid enough
to go back and believe him.

397
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,152
There’s only me

398
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,672
who have been doing everything for you.

399
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:45,784
Why do you never see my worth?

400
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,896
Then don’t do it.

401
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,640
Don’t forget that our relationship

402
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,520
has never involved love from the start.

403
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,696
Don’t you get tired of painting all day?

404
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,744
Well, I don’t.

405
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,744
I keep switching up techniques.

406
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,080
That’s nice.

407
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,672
It’s like you don’t have to be
ambitious about anything.

408
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:30,936
It doesn’t tire you out either.

409
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,224
I like living quietly.

410
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,128
I don’t like competing with people.

411
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,968
But I think for people like you,

412
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,320
if you really want something

413
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:46,832
then you would do anything to get it.

414
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,700
Doesn’t matter if the method is right or wrong.

415
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,500
I think you’re that kind of person.

416
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,688
Because I’m just like you.

417
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,392
Alright, I’ll head out.

418
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,944
I’ll get going.

419
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,536
I’ll be your model again later.

420
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,432
Are you hungry?

421
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,184
Yes.

422
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,552
What shall we have for dinner?

423
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:31,040
Is it your treat?

424
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Yeah.

425
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,264
Wait here.

426
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,504
Are you sure you really spot intruders?

427
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,968
Yes.

428
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:14,536
We’ve just installed a new infrared detector

429
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,072
after someone had trespassed back then.

430
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:18,152
When the system alarmed me,

431
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,768
I informed you right away.

432
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Then please check on that side.

433
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,856
Let me know if there’s anything.

434
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,056
I’ll check the other end.

435
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,096
Yes, Sir.

436
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:38,920
It’s you indeed.

437
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:46,648
I…

438
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,424
I can explain.

439
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,904
Keep your explanations for the police station.

440
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,832
It’s not like what you think.

441
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,344
I didn’t do anything wrong.

442
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Everyone who’s been caught says this.

443
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Turn around.

444
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,384
Arms behind your back.

445
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,672
Go! Go!

446
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,792
Hey!

447
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:42,824
Chain!

448
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,010
Go ahead and follow them!

449
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,472
Damn it!

450
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,360
That was one hell of a kick.

451
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,330
Urgh.

452
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,800
What do we do?

453
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,168
You didn’t tell me

454
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,376
that there was a new security system.

455
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,352
I was the one who brought it up at the meeting.

456
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,488
But I left the house before that

457
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,984
so I didn’t know it was done.

458
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,824
How can you forget such an important thing?

459
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,416
What about you?

460
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,528
Did you forget anything important?

461
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,120
Forget what?

462
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
You forgot to tell me about this.

463
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,680
Your dad’s file.

464
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,608
It was mixed among the files from the basement.

465
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,880
At first,

466
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,840
I thought you and Chat met

467
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:50,792
because our parents had an affair.

468
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,928
But the truth is not like that.

469
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,328
Look at the last page.

470
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,544
You lied to me.

471
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,616
You’re actually not Chat’s lover.

472
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,192
But you are Chat’s stepbrother.

473
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:26,360
And Chatfah is not
Asok Bupphachinda’s daughter.

474
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,008
But a daughter of Chad,

475
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,630
your father.

476
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,288
When were you planning to tell me this?

477
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,984
I didn’t plan to tell you in the first place.

478
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Why?

479
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,632
Are you afraid that if Chat didn’t die,

480
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,104
she wouldn’t get the legacy?

481
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,888
That’s part of it.

482
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,984
But the most important thing is Chatfah’s safety.

483
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,312
I don’t know if Chatfah would be in danger

484
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,352
if anyone learned about this truth.

485
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
I knew it.

486
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,344
It shouldn’t have trusted someone like you from the start.

487
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,744
You’re just using me.

488
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,192
Using you?

489
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,160
Did you forget that I saved you?

490
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,500
You saved me because
you wanted something in return.

491
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,568
You have so many secrets hidden

492
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,170
yet you still want me to trust you?

493
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:49,688
I almost forgot

494
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,664
that you’re still the daughter

495
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:54,232
of the man who murdered my dad.

496
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,528
We don’t need to trust each other anyway.

497
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,960
You’re here to find out the truth about your dad

498
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,352
and now, you know everything.

499
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,112
So the two of us

500
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:28,660
no longer need to stay together.

501
00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:03,570
Did anyone notice you coming in?

502
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
No.

503
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:06,970
I was being careful just as you told me to.

504
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,096
Is there anything?

505
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,264
Why did you call me in?

506
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,056
Were you in a relationship with Chat,

507
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,368
and slept with Chat

508
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,960
before seeing me?

509
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,270
Don’t lie.

510
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,528
I’m begging you.

511
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,860
Yes.

512
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,168
Before getting to know you,

513
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,680
I had slept with Chat.

514
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:03,100
But I wasn’t in a relationship with Chatfah.

515
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,416
We weren’t even a thing.

516
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,664
I know it’s not fair for Chat.

517
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,400
I’m sorry.

518
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,696
I understand if you can’t forgive me for this.

519
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,288
The thing is…

520
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,384
I don’t know what to feel anymore.

521
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,816
It’s like I got betrayed by you.

522
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,520
Got fooled by you.

523
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,576
Over and over again.

524
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,970
Chom.

525
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,344
I know I did so many wrong things.

526
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:03,376
But I’m trying to make it right.

527
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,920
Sorry for troubling you
so early in the morning, Chompoo.

528
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,570
It’s alright.

529
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,248
Is there anything?

530
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:42,856
We brought a warrant.

531
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,440
We’d like to invite you in for an investigation.

532
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,616
About what?

533
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:01,460
Have you ever seen this pair of scissors, Chompoo?

534
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,328
From our initial examination,

535
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,200
the blood on the scissors is confirmed to be Chatfah’s.

536
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,976
We suspect that this is the weapon

537
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,200
which killed Chatfah.

538
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,080
Besides Chatfah’s fingerprints,

539
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,016
we also found Chompoo’s fingerprints on it.

540
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,800
Why are you here?

541
00:39:43,832 --> 00:39:44,784
If you’re going to sell something,

542
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,328
I don’t have any money for that.

543
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,560
No, I’m looking for someone named ‘Fai’.

544
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,704
She used to be the farm manager
at the Buppha Company.

545
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,912
If you found her, then let me know.

546
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,104
What do you mean?

547
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,208
She’s been gone for over 10 years.

548
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:02,584
I’m her sister, yet she didn’t even tell me anything.

549
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:04,440
Didn’t she leave any words?

550
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,016
She called Mom once.

551
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,904
Saying that she had a problem with her husband

552
00:40:12,936 --> 00:40:14,328
and wanted to bring her child to us.

553
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:16,056
But in the end, she didn’t come.

554
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,416
Recently, people were saying her husband’s dead

555
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:21,512
but she still hasn’t come back.

556
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,968
If you really want to see her,

557
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,490
then go to her husband’s house.

558
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:28,144
The maid named Chomchai seems to know everything

559
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,592
she might be able to answer you.

560
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,024
Hold on.

561
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,600
Who is Fai’s husband?

562
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,632
It’s Kajorn.

563
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,336
Fai managed to bag herself a rich husband

564
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,584
but she has a low taste

565
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:41,260
and ran away with a worker at the farm.

566
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,840
Fai, the manager of the farm,

567
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,248
was Kajorn’s wife?

568
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,368
Oh, that's right.

569
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:55,152
Then her daughter is Parn?

570
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,024
Yes?

571
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,070
Chom!

572
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,160
I hope you will provide full cooperation
for this investigation.

573
00:41:17,328 --> 00:41:20,792
Do you know who sent the scissors?

574
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,464
I’d rather not answer.

575
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,664
Even if you don’t say it,

576
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,632
I kind of know who it was.

577
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,256
And I’m telling you now,

578
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:31,992
that person can’t be trusted.

579
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:34,192
I don’t trust anyone easily, neither.

580
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,576
Especially, everyone involved in this case.

581
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,728
The only thing I believe in is the evidence.

582
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,048
What if I tell you that

583
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,192
the evidence was staged?

584
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,664
Do you have anything to prove that?

585
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
The thing is…

586
00:41:59,608 --> 00:42:01,610
The truth is, that night…

587
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
It’s…

588
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:09,768
I was with

589
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,830
Chompoo didn’t stab Chatfah.

590
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,152
I can prove it.

591
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,608
Because that night,

592
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:26,610
I was there with Chompoo.

593
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,136
During the time Chatfah got stabbed and fell down,

594
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:33,432
I and Chompoo…

595
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:35,168
We were…

596
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
Um…

597
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,008
We were together in a room.

598
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,872
So Chompoo can’t have been the one
who stabbed Chatfah.

599
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,568
The evidence is the GPS tracking of my car

600
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,570
on the day Chatfah disappeared.

601
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,664
If you check it, you’ll see that

602
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,660
there’s Bupphachat Mansion on it.

603
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,824
There are the time stamps of when I got there

604
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,888
and when I left.

605
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,312
I also have the record of the car’s camera

606
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:07,168
with my phone conversation with Chompoo recorded.

607
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,568
All the information is in here.

608
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,980
Khem.

609
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,552
Where’s my sister?

610
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,000
Chom!

611
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
Pi!

612
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,808
I found the last bag of
the tea you like in the kitchen.

613
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Drink up.

614
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,088
Thank you.

615
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:33,040
Picha, we’ve bailed Chompoonuch out to defend her case.

616
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,744
But don’t worry.

617
00:44:34,784 --> 00:44:37,472
During this time, we’ll also be gathering evidence

618
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:40,104
to prove Chompoonuch’s innocence.

619
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,450
Don’t worry.

620
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,320
I’m not the culprit.

621
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,688
I’m not afraid.

622
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,704
I’ll be heading back to my apartment right away.

623
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:01,152
Do you want to come with me?

624
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,752
I brought my car.

625
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,216
I’d better go back by myself.

626
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:10,384
I think I want to rest a little longer.

627
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:11,952
Okay.

628
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,944
Thank you for today.

629
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,760
It’s something I should’ve done long ago.

630
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,520
GRANDMA

631
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,920
There are so many things to be done tomorrow.

632
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,416
I have to answer my Grandma’s questions.

633
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:48,696
And also the press’s.

634
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,552
Prepare your answers well.

635
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,816
There’s no need to prepare.

636
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,584
I’ve decided to only speak the truth.

637
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,712
I’ll get going.

638
00:46:01,744 --> 00:46:02,816
Okay.

639
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,704
THANA

640
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah?

641
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,224
Don’t call me again.

642
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:39,576
We don’t have anything to discuss.

643
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,056
(Don’t hang up yet!)

644
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,016
I didn’t send the scissors to the police.

645
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:50,392
Someone broke into my house

646
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:51,960
and took the scissors.

647
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,352
Those who know best about the scissors

648
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,320
are your family.

649
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,720
Some warm tea helps you sleep well.

650
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,032
Don’t you think?

651
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,160
(The game of life is full of danger.)

652
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,048
(Every victory has a prize.)

653
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,680
(Likewise, )

654
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,976
(every loss has a price to pay.)

655
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:15,912
You guys don’t die so easily.

656
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:19,072
I have to use so much power.

657
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,070
(No matter the method.)

658
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,984
(Whether it’s right or wrong.)

659
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,192
Please don’t be angry at me.

660
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,696
Think of it as

661
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:34,616
paying for what your dad did to me.

662
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,464
You hag!

663
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,870
Pi!

664
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,408
(It’s not as important as)

665
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:47,944
(whether or not you’re winning.)

666
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:49,208
Picha!

667
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,330
Picha!

668
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,630
Picha!

669
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,952
Picha, don’t sleep yet–

670
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,920
This picture should be on the news, saying

671
00:49:07,952 --> 00:49:11,816
“Sisters committed suicide together
to escape the guilt.”

672
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,368
But you guys probably won’t live to see it.

673
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,712
Keep your mouth open.

674
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,368
(Therefore, one thing the player should keep in mind is)

675
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,416
Eat up!

676
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,104
Eat up!

677
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:30,016
Eat up!

678
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,376
Argh!

679
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,304
If you have so much grudge against Dad,

680
00:49:36,328 --> 00:49:38,176
then go get your revenge in hell.

681
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
(If the rule is unfair, )

682
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,776
(then there’s no need to play by the rules.)

683
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:45,288
Don’t f*cking bother my sisters.

684
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,200
Argh!

685
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,680
It was probably a car crash against a tree.

686
00:49:57,712 --> 00:50:00,072
She was the one who killed Uncle Kajorn and Chat.

687
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,136
You investigated everything in this by yourself?

688
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,568
Let me stay like this

689
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,784
for a little longer.

690
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:08,984
Any progress on Sarah’s case?

691
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,952
The police found out everything.

692
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:12,472
I’m suspecting that

693
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:16,672
the will we read might have been written anew.
