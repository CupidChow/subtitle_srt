1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,200
Then from now on,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,120
we have to say the same thing.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,120
Our sister is gone.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,360
And the three of us are not involved at all.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,000
Chom, my engagement ring.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,200
There’s no one here?

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,760
But I really heard a sound from here.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,199
The house is old.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,640
It’s probably a wood creaking sound.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,960
I didn’t get enough sleep lately.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Yes, Inspector.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Yes.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
A meeting?

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Sure.

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Hey.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
The inspector calls an urgent meeting.

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Hey.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,336
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Did what?

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
You purposely sent me into the room, didn’t you?

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,080
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,560
I knew it. This is strange.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,560
You offered to help me without asking anything.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,759
You set me up to be in the room.
So the police would find me there.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,560
I found this in the room.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
If I planned that,

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
why would I go in to help you?

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,880
I would have let the police arrest you.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,320
You probably changed your mind or something.

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,880
I saw the police in the house.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
So I sneaked in to help you.

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,680
About the scissors, I didn’t put them there.

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,760
This is the first time I've seen it.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,480
Then why didn’t you ask me
what I was doing in the house?

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
That…

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,560
That night,

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I saw it.

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,240
Nathat was at the house that night.

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,560
But he pretended as if he had just arrived.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
My guess is…

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,040
you didn’t tell the police about him.

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,480
You knew?

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,120
It has the date and time when the video was taken.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
If the police find the video,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
do you think…

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,600
they will see Nathat as a suspect,

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,320
or they will think
you and Nathat were in it together?

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,840
Aren’t you underestimating me?

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Don’t forget.

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,720
In this world,

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,480
there’s technology called data backup.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
What do you want?

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,760
You were the one who taught me this.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,920
Taught you what?

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Everything has its price.

57
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,040
It always costs you something.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Don’t worry.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,960
I’ll keep it a secret between us.

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,440
Even Nathat will not know about it.

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
But…

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,080
I have a condition.

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
What do you want?

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
I’m curious.

65
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,680
Who do you love more, yourself or Nathat?

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,360
(Trust is a double-edged sword.)

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
(It’s not easy to build it.)

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
(But it’s so easy to destroy it.)

69
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
(It has a special power.)

70
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
(If you give it to the wrong man, )

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,120
(it will change you.)

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,200
(From an everyman, )

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,400
(you will become a fool.)

74
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,440
Damn it.

75
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,360
2019

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,759
I’M ROOTING FOR YOU, CHOMPOO.
YOU’RE A VICTIM. STAY STRONG.

77
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,559
YOU’RE A VICTIM. STAY STRONG.
THEY AREN’T WRONG TO TAKE THE VIDEO.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,200
I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU, CHOMPOO.
I’M ROOTING FOR YOU.

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,200
THOSE WHO RELEASED THE VIDEO SHOULD BE EXPOSED AND CONDEMNED.

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I…

81
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I didn’t know how it was leaked.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
The problem is not how it was leaked.

83
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,400
The problem is why it existed in the first place.

84
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,960
I was young.

85
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,360
I can’t turn back time and fix it.

86
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,360
Find a country for her.

87
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,920
Somewhere far away.

88
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,640
It would be great if it’s a rural small town.

89
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Dad, are you sending her to study abroad?

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,920
I don’t care if she’ll study or do whatever.

91
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
Cover up the scandal.

92
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,560
Don’t let her picture be on any media.

93
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,560
Dad, are you sending me away?

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,200
What about my work and life here?

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,680
You ruined it with your own hands.

96
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
It’s not my fault.

97
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,960
I didn’t mean it.

98
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,120
I’m a victim here.

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,839
Why don’t you tell
the company’s legal team to help me?

100
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,720
Why don’t you help me?

101
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,720
You want me to help you?

102
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
A slut like you?

103
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,040
As the old saying goes…

104
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,080
having a daughter is like
having a toilet in front of your house.

105
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,240
Now, I get it.

106
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,120
I have four toilets.

107
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,360
You are the stinkiest one.

108
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,360
Do you care about the family’s reputation…

109
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,920
more than me?

110
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,000
Everything has its price.

111
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,520
Because you were born into this family.

112
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,280
You have a comfortable life.

113
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,920
But you have a price to pay.

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
You…

115
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
You didn’t use it wisely.

116
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I will never put the future of this family…

117
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,080
into your hands.

118
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Okay.

119
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,080
If you no longer think I’m your daughter,

120
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
then I’ll no longer be your daughter.

121
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,760
I won’t take anything from this family.

122
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
I won’t receive anything from you.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I’ll live on my own feet.

124
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Chompoo.

125
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Chom.

126
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Chom.

127
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,560
Chompoo.

128
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
What?

129
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
Calm down.

130
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,479
Go back to apologize to Dad and talk to him.

131
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,720
Apologize for what?

132
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
Didn’t you hear what he said?

133
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,679
Do you want me to apologize to him?

134
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Chom.

135
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Calm down.
I think Dad is just mad.

136
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,680
You may be able to endure
when he scolds or looks down on you.

137
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
But I’m not you.

138
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,080
I have no one left.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,719
This family is not my safe zone anymore.

140
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,960
You still have me, Chom.

141
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,720
I get it.
I know what you are going through.

142
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,160
But he doesn’t.

143
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,920
You need to give him some time.

144
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
You did it, didn’t you?

145
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,320
What are you talking about?

146
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,280
The video that doesn’t censor my face
is posted only on Twitter.

147
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
Dad doesn’t use the app.

148
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
Then it must be you.

149
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,040
When will you stop
being jealous of your sisters?

150
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,280
How far are you going to hurt me?

151
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,960
Do you have anything I need to be jealous of?

152
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,040
Chat!

153
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Chompoo.

154
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Chat.

155
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,520
Just like Dad said,

156
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,880
The problem is not how it is leaked.

157
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
The problem is
why you took the video in the first place.

158
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
Get out of your bubble.

159
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
This is the 21st century.

160
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,760
I am a victim here.

161
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,760
I won’t stand and let you condemn me for it.

162
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,760
A victim?

163
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,720
Because that’s what the netizen said?

164
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,720
Because they are rooting for you?

165
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
In reality, is any of them on your side?

166
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Does anyone believe what you said?

167
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,520
Everyone believes what they want to believe.

168
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,560
Wake up and smell the coffee, Chom.

169
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,720
In reality, you are just another woman
who is involved in a sex tape incident.

170
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,120
Chat.
Chom.

171
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Chom, calm down.

172
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Chom.

173
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,000
Chom, calm down.

174
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Let me go.

175
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Chat.

176
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,160
Are you okay?

177
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,760
Stop acting like a fool.

178
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,160
I tell you this because I feel sorry for you.

179
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,480
Chat will never choose you.

180
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,439
She thinks you are easy to fool.

181
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,200
You’ll do anything that she tells you to do.

182
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,320
You’re not a donkey.
Use your brain.

183
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,480
I know that.

184
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,080
I did everything because I love her.

185
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Stop deluding yourself.

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,200
We all want something in return.

187
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,559
When you give someone something,

188
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
you hope to get something in return.

189
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,440
Everything has its price.
It’ll cost you something.

190
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,520
I’m curious.

191
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,640
You said you love her.

192
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
Do you love her more than yourself?

193
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
One day, if you find out
that everything you did is useless,

194
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,080
Will you be able to accept it?

195
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
(I’ll keep it a secret between us.)

196
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,560
(Even Nathat will not know about it.)

197
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,160
(But…)

198
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,280
(I have a condition.)

199
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,960
(What do you want?)

200
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,600
(I’m curious.)

201
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,560
(Who do you love more, yourself or Nathat?)

202
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,440
BAIBUA

203
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
What?

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
(Do you see the news on the internet?)

205
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
What news?

206
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,280
(It’s okay if you haven’t seen it.)

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,720
(You must not give an interview about it.)

208
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
(I’ll take care of the rest.)

209
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Huh?

210
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,760
Aren’t you listening to what we just said?

211
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,239
Don’t you feel anything?

212
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,719
Have you no humanity left?

213
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,519
Do you only care about your ratings?

214
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,999
How could you do this?
Get out of my way.

215
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,919
I USED TO FEEL BAD FOR HER DURING THE SEX TAPE INCIDENT. NOW, SHE’S ACTING CHILDISH.

216
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,879
AMONG THE SISTERS, SHE’S THE CRINGIEST.

217
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,879
SHE RUINS THE GOOD REPUTATION
HER SISTERS HAVE BUILT.

218
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,839
CHOMPOO USED TO
DATE CHATFAH’S FIANCÉE, RIGHT?

219
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,839
TO BE HONEST, SHE’S THE MOST SUSPICIOUS.

220
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,719
THE REPORTERS HADN’T SAID ANYTHING.

221
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
BUT SHE ALREADY GOT UPSET
AS IF SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

222
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,880
YOU KILLED YOUR SISTER, DIDN’T YOU?

223
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Nathat.

224
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
What are you doing here?

225
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,440
Did your grandma know about this?

226
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I lied to her, saying that I had work to do.

227
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,080
Don’t worry about the news.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,520
About the photos,
I think the media still doesn’t know about it.

229
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,160
Whoever sent them
hasn’t told the media about it.

230
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,400
I came to see you today.

231
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,000
I’m here to tell you
that I’m going to hold a press conference.

232
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,960
I’m going to tell the truth
about what happened that night.

233
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
So you will no longer be the suspect.

234
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,280
A victim?

235
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
Because that’s what the netizen said?

236
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,240
Because they are rooting for you?

237
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
In reality, is any of them on your side?

238
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Does anyone believe what you said?

239
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,800
Everyone believes what they want to believe.

240
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
Let’s call it quits.

241
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Chom.

242
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
Our relationship,

243
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,360
it’s wrong from the beginning.

244
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
This is the consequence.

245
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,080
We did things that we shouldn’t do.

246
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
We started on the wrong track.

247
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,760
We can never get it right.

248
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,960
Chom, you know that I love you.

249
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,880
I don’t love Chatfah.

250
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,239
I have to marry her because…

251
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,320
She’s pregnant.

252
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
I know.

253
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,600
I’ve known for some time.

254
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,200
You slept with her while we were dating.

255
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,640
I pretended that I didn’t know.

256
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,160
I thought it was love.

257
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Chom.

258
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I love you.

259
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
If Chat didn’t force me…

260
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
It doesn’t matter anymore.

261
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,960
We came too far.

262
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,480
You should leave.

263
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,760
If someone sees you, things will get worse.

264
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Chom.

265
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,920
I want to be with you.

266
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,520
I want to fight through this with you.

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,400
Fight for what?

268
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,760
So I will become a suspect?

269
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,560
We will waste years in court to prove that we are innocent.

270
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
No one will believe us.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,720
Let’s end it here.

272
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,360
Before our lives are ruined.

273
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
YOU ARE NEXT.

274
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
I’m sorry.

275
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,080
Hey.

276
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Hey.

277
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,520
How is your car?

278
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,160
Did the mechanics say anything?

279
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
They said it’s a brake fluid leak.

280
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Did they find anything unusual?

281
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
No.

282
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,160
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

283
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,720
I’m glad that you’re safe.

284
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,080
About what you said yesterday,

285
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,640
I don’t have any prejudice
when investigating this case.

286
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,120
You didn’t think I sabotaged your brake, right?

287
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,000
Did you?

288
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
If I were going to take revenge on you,

289
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
why would I help you?

290
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,360
You might try to fool me
that you are a good cop.

291
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,120
I think you read fiction too much.

292
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,560
You used to laugh a lot.

293
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,920
Look at everything that happened lately.

294
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,960
How can anyone laugh?

295
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,080
Do you really have no clue…

296
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,720
what happened to your sister?

297
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,760
If I knew, you wouldn’t be sitting here.

298
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
Do you think she may be safe,

299
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
but she’s lying low somewhere?

300
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
We…\

301
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,080
We used all the manpower that we had
to find her.

302
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,800
The wood is big.

303
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,000
I don’t think she can go far by herself,

304
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,440
if she was injured like you said.

305
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,000
My sister is hiding in the woods?

306
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,720
No way.

307
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,480
She loves comfort more than anything.

308
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,600
If you told me she was hiding at her condo,

309
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
that might be possible.

310
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,600
Do you really think she would go to her condo?

311
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
No.

312
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
Her injury was serious.

313
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,456
There’s no way she can go there by herself.

314
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,240
I have another question.

315
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,360
Are you sure that she was stabbed?

316
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,640
Why did you come to buy coffee at this café?

317
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,360
You usually go to the café
at the corner of the street.

318
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,280
This café is more interesting.

319
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Don’t tell me that you are interested in this sister?

320
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,640
Yes, I am.

321
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,320
But not in the way that you think.

322
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,280
What did you talk to her about?

323
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
I only asked her the questions that I had.

324
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,920
From her reactions,

325
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,560
I think she’s hiding something.

326
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
So?

327
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Shall we follow her?

328
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
No.

329
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,080
She will come to us.

330
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
What’s up, Pi?

331
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Do you think Chat would go back to her room?

332
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,720
Her condo?

333
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
With the injury, she couldn’t walk.

334
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,960
That’s what I think, too.

335
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,000
But are we sure that she was stabbed?

336
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,840
What do you mean?

337
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I…

338
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,080
Forget it.

339
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,680
But…

340
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,920
Bua, do you have the keycard to her condo?

341
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,800
No.

342
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,400
But I have a way to get it.

343
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,800
The police told me to check her room.

344
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Maybe I’ll find some leads.

345
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,919
I saw the news.

346
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
We are worried about Miss Chat.

347
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,280
If there’s anything I can help you with,
please let me know.

348
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,280
Thank you.

349
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Yes.

350
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Bua.

351
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
How are you?

352
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,160
Since the incident, I haven’t checked on you.

353
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
What did the police say?

354
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,360
There are no new updates yet.

355
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Right.

356
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
That night,

357
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
where were you?

358
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,760
I told you.

359
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,456
The on-grid solar system on the farm was broken.

360
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,240
I went there to fix it.

361
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,240
Otherwise, the farm would be out of power at night.

362
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
To be honest,

363
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,320
I don’t want to rush this.

364
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,280
But…

365
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,960
If Chatfah is gone,

366
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,800
the distribution of his assets
will be different, right?

367
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,880
She is only missing.

368
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,560
She’s not dead yet.

369
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,400
That’s not what I mean.

370
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,760
I think we shouldn’t talk about it yet.

371
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,520
MEET WITH MANGKORN.

372
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
Mangkorn?

373
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,080
God Gem?

374
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,360
It’s so pretty.

375
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,240
It looks so glam.

376
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,960
I’m working really hard on this collection.

377
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,240
I hope that my brand will set new trends.

378
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Does it look pretty?

379
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,560
I’ll go take a shower.

380
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
The police also asked me about it.

381
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,480
I told them the truth.

382
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,759
Mr. Kajorn came here that night.

383
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,080
The solar system went down earlier that day.

384
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,760
I think he came here to solve it.

385
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,160
Did anyone see him here?

386
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,280
He went to my house to get the key.

387
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,120
Did he fix it?

388
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
No.

389
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,320
At night, we use power from an electrical grid.

390
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,800
We could wait to call a technician in the morning.

391
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Does it mean…

392
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Uncle Kajorn didn’t need to come here?

393
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,200
He was probably worried about it.

394
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,600
He might want to check the new lot of pesticides

395
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
which was delivered recently.

396
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Pesticides?

397
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Yes.

398
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,640
He came to check them
every time they were delivered.

399
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,000
Are these all pesticides?

400
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,480
Do we need this much pesticide?

401
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,600
I have reported it to the head office.

402
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,240
Some lots were too big.

403
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
It was too big to store them all in our warehouse.

404
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,880
Instead, Mr. Kajorn approved
building a new warehouse.

405
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,640
But why did he need to supervise it?

406
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
It’s not an important matter.
Workers can do it.

407
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
He might get used to doing it.

408
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,920
He has been doing this
since Mr. Asok was still alive.

409
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,720
Thank you.

410
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
I’ll take a look around.

411
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,560
Don’t tell anyone that I’m here.

412
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
Reporters keep an eye on us.

413
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,000
I don’t want anything to affect Chat’s case.

414
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Yes.

415
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You.

416
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
You.

417
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I’m so sorry for being late.

418
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,120
I couldn’t sleep last night.

419
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
I’m sorry.

420
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,456
I texted you that you don’t need to come.

421
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,360
What are you doing here?
I rushed here.

422
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,800
So I didn’t check your message.

423
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,160
Am I going to work with her?

424
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,760
No, it’s not about that.

425
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,080
It’s about the news on X last night.

426
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
What news?

427
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
What news?

428
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,760
You haven’t seen it?

429
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,560
HIS FIANCÉE WENT MISSING
BUT HE WENT TO HER SISTER’S CONDO.

430
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,560
Although the investigation is not over,

431
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,360
people have already judged you.

432
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,320
I think you need to take a break
for the meantime.

433
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,840
I’ll cover your work for you.

434
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,440
I feel bad for you.

435
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
What?

436
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,520
I went to the farm.

437
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,080
I found what you have been hiding all these years.

438
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
What did you find?

439
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,800
The pesticides that you ordered.

440
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,880
It exceeds the amount allowed by the law.

441
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,856
I checked the pesticide order records
in the past several years.

442
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,720
The records were falsified.

443
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,320
The amount that you ordered,

444
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,840
it’s large enough
to cause contamination and pollution.

445
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,079
If the evidence is leaked,

446
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,520
our company will lose the pollution lawsuit.

447
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,360
You will be responsible for it.

448
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,600
Why did you order a larger amount
than we need?

449
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,480
Is this a corruption?

450
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,360
Did you have a deal with the supplier?

451
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,760
Did you use our company to launder money?

452
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,880
You said you have evidence.

453
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
How much do you know?

454
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,040
I have enough evidence to send you to jail.

455
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,960
But you have been working for my dad
for a long time.

456
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,880
I’ll give you a chance.

457
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,520
Shall I tell this to the executive board?

458
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,920
Or will you confess it to them?

459
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,240
It’s up to you.

460
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,360
You have the evidence.

461
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
The meeting room is ready.

462
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,440
You don’t need to attend it if you don’t want

463
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,320
But I want you to submit your resignation
as soon as possible.

464
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
We can talk about the company’s shares later.

465
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,760
From now on,

466
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,120
I’ll take care of my dad’s company.

467
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,360
I’m glad…

468
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,160
to see that you became more competent.

469
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,960
I also believe
that your dad would be proud of you.

470
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,760
But you know what?

471
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,320
Intelligence is a double-edged sword.

472
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,960
If you are overconfident in your intelligence,

473
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,600
sometimes, you can turn into a fool.

474
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,800
You can say whatever you want.

475
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,720
I already have the evidence.

476
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Evidence?

477
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Do you mean this?

478
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,360
APPROVED BY
MR. ASOKSAPUN BUPPHACHINDA
CHEMICALS – FIVE MILLION BAHT.

479
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,560
He would never do this.

480
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,440
How well do you think you know your dad?

481
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,240
Are you sure
you know everything that he did?

482
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,800
I told you.

483
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,760
If you are overconfident in your intelligence,

484
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
you will turn into…

485
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
a fool.

486
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,440
I knew that
Chatfah gave you my collection’s information.

487
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,720
In exchange, you would hire her
as your brand ambassador.

488
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,600
Your company is the market leader.

489
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,960
So my sister used this tactic
to gain advantages.

490
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Do you have evidence to prove it, Miss Picha?

491
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,720
I found the sketches of my latest collection
in her condo.

492
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,840
I came to meet you today to tell you this.

493
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,600
This will be the last time
you will have my sketches.

494
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,560
If your company tries to copy my designs again,

495
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,960
I’ll meet you in court,

496
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,120
not in a café.

497
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,440
What you should worry about is not my company.

498
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,160
What do you mean?

499
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,960
We are not the only brand
your sister wanted to work with.

500
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,760
Chat, where did you get the puppy from?

501
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,880
Parn said it sneaked through the fence.

502
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,079
Dad told Aunt Chom to get rid of it.

503
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,960
But Parn hid it and gave it to me.

504
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,360
Dad told Aunt Chom to get rid of it.

505
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,200
It means that he doesn’t allow us to keep it.

506
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,080
But I want to keep it.
I’ll secretly raise it.

507
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,240
Go, little fluffball.

508
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,960
If Dad finds out, you will be scolded, Chat.

509
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,960
Then don’t tell him, Pi.

510
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Keep it a secret between us.

511
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,320
What did you do?

512
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,960
I told Chom to get rid of it.

513
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,200
Why is it here?

514
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,360
I don’t know.

515
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,520
You are playing in the garden all day.

516
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,520
There are dog footprints everywhere.

517
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,920
How can you say you don’t know?

518
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,400
Who took it here and did this to it?

519
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Answer me.

520
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
Pi did it.

521
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,920
You did it?

522
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,960
Ouch.

523
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Ouch.

524
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:11,920
Ouch.
Miss Pi.

525
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Miss Pi.

526
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Miss Pi.

527
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Picha.

528
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,040
Picha.

529
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,360
Picha.

530
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Miss Pi.

531
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,880
Nathat is here.

532
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,560
Mr. Nathat, please answer us.

533
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,680
What is the nature of your relationship
with Chompoo, Chatfah’s sister?

534
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,696
There’s a rumor that you were with Chompoo
on the night that Chatfah went missing.

535
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,840
Is it true?

536
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,880
Please answer the question.

537
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,960
Please answer us.

538
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,680
Please answer the questions.

539
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Officer.

540
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,000
I came here to tell the truth.

541
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,840
The truth is that Chompoo has an alibi.

542
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,440
Her alibi is…

543
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,160
She was with me.

544
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,280
That night,

545
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,360
she was with me.

546
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,520
You are Chatfah’s sister.

547
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,160
In the intestate succession hierarchy,
your rank is higher than mine.

548
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,200
But I think you are stressed about finding her.

549
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,240
Why don’t you let me
handle the appointment of the executor?

550
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,360
It will be good if you step in to help her.

551
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,440
Since you are currently
the acting president of the company.

552
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Yes.

553
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,760
NESS (MY SECRETARY)

554
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Hello.

555
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,400
Miss Pi, our design has been chosen.

556
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,216
They want us to speed up the production
as fast as possible.

557
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,600
So we can have an opening
in Dubai next month.

558
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,480
I believe what you and your sister told me.

559
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,640
After the accident,

560
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,520
you all went back to your rooms.

561
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,200
We found blood on the stairs and in your rooms.

562
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,040
But there’s one thing I don’t understand.

563
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,600
Why did we find blood in Chatfah’s room?

564
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
One more thing,

565
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,920
the important thing
that shouldn’t have been missing,

566
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,760
it went missing that night.

567
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Do you know…

568
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,680
where her phone is?

569
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,920
I don’t know.

570
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,280
(Dad always told us.)

571
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,280
You made the right decision.

572
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,120
(We are family. We need to love,
help, and take care of each other.)

573
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,640
(But he never told us to trust each other.)

574
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,920
I understand how you feel.

575
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Siblings,

576
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,320
They are enemies
who were born from the same parents.

577
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,800
The difference is…

578
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,520
your dad was luckier than I.

579
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,760
He got everything before me.

580
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Now,

581
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
it’s my time.

582
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,040
(Because it’s hard
to understand the human mind.)

583
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,920
(We never know when we will become a fool.)

584
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,360
(So don’t trust anyone.)

585
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,560
(Not even yourself.)

586
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,960
Someone called to tell the police that they saw me walk out of the mansion with bloody scissors.

587
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,440
Are you looking for the scissors?

588
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,480
I don’t know who sent it.

589
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,520
Picha.

590
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,560
In this notebook, she was going to meet Mangkorn.

591
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,520
Chat was hiding something from us.

592
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,160
You killed Chatfah, didn’t you?
