1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Chatfah has a video from Chompoo’s birthday.

2
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:03,968
Her phone is turned on?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Yes.

4
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:06,344
Chain and I are going to check it.

5
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:07,784
From the location,

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,832
I don’t know how it got there.

7
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,184
See you soon.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,840
Fluffy!

9
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:29,660
Fluffy!

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,792
Where are you, Fluffy?

11
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:31,808
Fluffy!

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,976
(Nothing’s more terrifying)

13
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:38,808
(than losing hope.)

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,000
Fluffy!!!!

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,968
(When the hope is taken away,)

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
(that’s when a human loses their ardor.)

17
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,110
Fluffy’s dead.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,336
Why did that uncle have to do that?

19
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,872
Pay it no mind.

20
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,960
And did Dad

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,344
suspect anything?

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,984
And why the frown?

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,864
You

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,552
weren’t punished or anything

25
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:45,160
so why the long face?

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,984
Pi got punished instead of me.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,568
I told Dad the way you told me to.

28
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,896
So Pi got caned.

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,824
But if I hadn’t done that,

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,720
Dad would have suspected.

31
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:08,528
About how that dog got in here

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,760
and how it died.

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,184
If that’s the case,

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
both you and I, Chatfah,

35
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:16,680
we’d be in trouble.

36
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,168
If you don't say it,

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,176
and I don’t say it,

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,368
nobody will find out.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,680
Do you know?

40
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,872
Building trust

41
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,870
is to have a shared secret.

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,544
The more shared secrets we have,

43
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,432
the more we love each other.

44
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,200
(And become a puppet)

45
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,200
(who can’t think for themselves.)

46
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,472
Are you going to the camp already?

47
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,904
Sounds fun.

48
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,816
I want to come along too.

49
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,088
Wait until you’re all grown up, baby girl.

50
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,616
As if Dad would let me go when I’m all grown up.

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,624
If it wasn’t because you said
it’s the university’s activity,

52
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,120
Dad wouldn’t have let you go.

53
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,184
That’s right.

54
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,088
You know?

55
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:26,736
When I went to ask for his permission,

56
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,024
I was so nervous.

57
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,384
Frankly speaking,

58
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:32,968
I’ve never gone out with my university friends.

59
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,208
Don’t know if they’d hold that against me by now.

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,304
Bua.

61
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,608
I can never understand Dad.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,032
He says that as a girl,

63
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,296
we should be careful.

64
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,744
Never go running around and taint yourselves.

65
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,496
But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it.

66
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:51,832
If we didn’t do anything wrong.

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,384
Come on.

68
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,456
I think Dad’s just worried about us.

69
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,008
Alright.

70
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:05,992
By the way, where’s Chom?

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,960
Did her stomachache get better?

72
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,960
I didn’t see her joining us at dinner.

73
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:12,128
I didn’t see her either.

74
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,400
Ouch!

75
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,928
Chom!

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,376
Did you get in through the window?

77
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,576
Of course.

78
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:28,968
Dad would tell me off if I got in through the front gate.

79
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:29,968
Help her out.

80
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,176
Come here.

81
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,960
Careful.

82
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:33,840
No need! I can walk!

83
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:34,608
You’re going to step on it.

84
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:35,392
Be careful!

85
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:36,904
Careful! Careful!

86
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,184
- You don’t have to help–
- Woah! Woah!

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,560
Careful!

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,608
Let me get the booze.

89
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,456
No, that’s enough!

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,536
Chompoo!

91
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
I put her to bed already.

92
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,792
She won’t comprehend anything right now.

93
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,576
Talk to her tomorrow.

94
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,296
Yes.

95
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,344
And from tomorrow on,

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,840
no one gets home later than 5 PM.

97
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,368
You have to join dinner all together every day.

98
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,664
No exceptions.

99
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,568
In case of being sick,

100
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,512
but not to the extent of going to the hospital,

101
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,568
everyone still has to join.

102
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:34,728
Yes.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,568
And no spending the night elsewhere

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,960
regardless of the reason.

105
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,216
But…

106
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:45,024
Um…

107
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,672
I’m going to a camp with my faculty tomorrow.

108
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,016
Bua.

109
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,512
If you can’t set a good example for your sister,

110
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,448
they won’t listen to you.

111
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,136
But I didn’t do anything wrong.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,088
I once told you, didn't I?

113
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,904
That until Mom is back,

114
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,744
you have a duty to take care of your sisters.

115
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,216
And what is this?

116
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,936
You let your sister sneak out

117
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,400
and she came home drunk.

118
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,384
If anything happened to her,

119
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,832
how would you take responsibility?

120
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,152
As a leader,

121
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,968
you have to be responsible

122
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:30,200
for the people under your care.

123
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,824
Even if the fault

124
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,472
wasn’t something you did.

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,672
Understood?

126
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,192
Yes.

127
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,952
Hey!

128
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:28,776
Shit!

129
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,976
Hey!

130
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,160
Stop.

131
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:36,792
Stop.

132
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,976
Stop.

133
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,944
What are you doing?

134
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,552
Huh?

135
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,248
Shoot!

136
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,024
What the fuck are you doing?

137
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,384
Why did you do that?

138
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,512
Do what?

139
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,736
Why did you kill Uncle Kajorn?

140
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,208
Uncle Kajorn? What?

141
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,192
- I didn’t–
- Why did you kill him?!

142
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,520
Wait, I think you misunderstood.

143
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,296
You’re really going to shoot–

144
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,552
Get that out!

145
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,928
You!

146
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,920
Let me go.

147
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,648
Hey!

148
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,304
Let me go.

149
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,872
How can you kill me?

150
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,160
I saved you!

151
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:16,768
Saved my ass!

152
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,752
Listen.

153
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,912
If I hadn’t helped you,

154
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,704
you would have been a murderer by now.

155
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,424
Got that?

156
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,584
Or did the medicine…

157
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,664
Okay?

158
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,072
Hey.

159
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,800
Calm down.

160
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:58,976
Oh shi–!

161
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,488
Damn it!

162
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:20,880
Where is this place?!

163
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,808
You’d better quit it.

164
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,448
Where are you running to?

165
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
It’s still some distance before you see any houses.

166
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,088
Are you going to the mansion?

167
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,520
I’ll take you there.

168
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,104
Okay?

169
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,256
How can I trust you?

170
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,120
I should be the one to ask.

171
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:09,352
How can I trust you, right?

172
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,536
You passed out for one night.

173
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:14,540
I didn’t lay a finger on you.

174
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,360
But I got stabbed within 5 minutes of you waking up.

175
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,808
Fine.

176
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,608
No problem.

177
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,840
You can walk until you wear yourself out to death

178
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,770
if that’s what you want.

179
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,608
But all your stories

180
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,008
will end right here.

181
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:52,250
You won’t know anything more.

182
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,864
Would you like that?

183
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,960
Then you have to answer me first.

184
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,408
Who are you?

185
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,000
And how did you get to know Chatfah?

186
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:06,768
I’ll tell you!

187
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,752
I can tell you!

188
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,824
I’ll tell you everything!

189
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,680
But are we going to talk here?

190
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,360
It’s scorching.

191
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:17,590
If you’re thinking about doing anything…

192
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:22,020
This won’t just jab your arm

193
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:24,860
but it will stab your throat instead.

194
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,936
I’d believe so.

195
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,880
Alright.

196
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,768
If you have any evidence

197
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:01,360
then let us know.

198
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,328
Then I’ll have a check around.

199
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,288
Sure, please go ahead.

200
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,584
They probably found the body already.

201
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,376
Don’t let anyone see you.

202
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:16,144
Otherwise, you’ll be arrested.

203
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,304
I’ll wait for you in the woods over there.

204
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,920
Hey! You!

205
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,776
Hello.

206
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,192
Hello.

207
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,568
Where are you heading to?

208
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,312
Straight ahead, if I can.

209
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:52,696
There are so many cops here, it seems.

210
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,400
For this road,

211
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,168
we need to block it for now.

212
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,904
Please use other routes.

213
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,248
Um, alright.

214
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,496
Yes.

215
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,680
Let’s check over there.

216
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:08,800
This area is for work.

217
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:25,980
Is Uncle Kajorn really dead?

218
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,512
The medicine is the same.

219
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,168
Why do I still sleepwalk?

220
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,376
CHAT

221
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
You haven’t found Miss Baibua, right?

222
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:37,256
Not yet.

223
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:39,552
Her car is still parked in the same spot too.

224
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,984
Then please let me have a look in her room.

225
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,072
Yes.

226
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,112
Miss Baibua’s room is still the same.

227
00:15:58,144 --> 00:16:00,672
Just as when she disappeared.

228
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,416
If you find Miss Baibua

229
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,776
or if she happens to reach out,

230
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,776
please let me know right away.

231
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,880
Yes.

232
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,792
Hey!

233
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,544
I thought you wouldn’t be able to get out.

234
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,888
The police are everywhere.

235
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:30,824
I…

236
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:33,270
I snuck out through the woods beside the mansion.

237
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,408
And did no one spot you?

238
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,584
I waited until the police left before sneaking out.

239
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,920
Someone put Chatfah’s phone in my phone’s case

240
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:50,448
and left it in my bedroom.

241
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,336
This phone was gone

242
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,952
since the day Chatfah disappeared.

243
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,480
Someone’s intentionally trying to frame me.

244
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,856
For both what happened to Chat

245
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,080
and Uncle Kajorn.

246
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:11,080
Right now…

247
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,104
I have completely become a suspect.

248
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:20,390
Mr. Asok sent a representative?

249
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,136
Yes.

250
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,592
Didn’t he tell you?

251
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,480
I don’t normally talk about work

252
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,448
while I’m eating.

253
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,790
Mr. Asok only told me that

254
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,200
your 20th anniversary of working

255
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,200
has just passed.

256
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,896
So we’ve prepared some present

257
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,360
to congratulate.

258
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,336
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:52,744
Bringing me money at such a place?

260
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,776
You’re looking down on me way too much.

261
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,208
Um… I don’t mean to…

262
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,432
Hello, sir.

263
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:05,816
Do you remember me?

264
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,000
I’m Chatfah,

265
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:08,800
Mr. Asoksapun’s daughter.

266
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,984
We’ve met before.

267
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,960
That day, when I went golfing with Dad.

268
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:21,864
Oh, Chatfah!

269
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,296
The youngest daughter, right?

270
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,432
Yes.

271
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,664
And this is Bua,

272
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:28,200
the eldest sister.

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,512
Why didn’t you tell me from the start

274
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:36,680
that you’re Mr. Asoksapun’s daughter?

275
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,336
Bua might not have known

276
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,792
that you are close to Dad.

277
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:42,184
But I can remember.

278
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:43,760
I was talking to Dad

279
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,088
that we’d like to invite you to Japan together.

280
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,472
As a celebration of your work anniversary.

281
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,624
A VIP trip with only exclusive guests.

282
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,568
Goodbye.

283
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,552
He’ll let his men know.

284
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:17,536
We won’t have to worry about this for a while.

285
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,360
I didn’t want him to know that I am Dad’s daughter.

286
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,624
Why did you intervene?

287
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,424
But Mom told me to help you out.

288
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,624
She said you’re too straightforward.

289
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:31,620
You might not be able to handle this kind of person.

290
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,968
But Dad assigned me this job himself.

291
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,128
Maybe Mom knew better.

292
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,336
That this is all you can do.

293
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,016
You want to prove to Dad that

294
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,672
without his name,

295
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,688
you would still be able to wrap up this deal.

296
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,008
But what you didn’t think about at all

297
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,010
was the power of bargaining.

298
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,232
What do you think

299
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,224
is something that makes people believe

300
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,664
and get taken advantage of?

301
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,136
It’s money.

302
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:09,170
It’s actually hope.

303
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,432
Hope is powerful.

304
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,528
Even when there’s a knife to your throat,

305
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,256
if you have the hope that you’ll survive,

306
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,776
you wouldn’t fear anything.

307
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,336
The victims of phone scams

308
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:25,792
were also fed with hopes of getting money,

309
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,256
getting married,

310
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:28,760
or getting to move to another country.

311
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,184
So they're willing to do anything

312
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,072
even if it’s wrong.

313
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,256
You just have to find out

314
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,392
what they want exactly

315
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:40,390
then feed them hope

316
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,384
that if they do as you say,

317
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,824
they’d get that.

318
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
They just have to do what they were told.

319
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,592
For this person,

320
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:53,336
his hope is to get the connection with high-class people.

321
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,780
Some people might want power,

322
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,024
fame,

323
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,360
honor,

324
00:20:58,392 --> 00:20:59,312
love,

325
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,904
or regards from people in the society

326
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:02,970
or their family.

327
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,960
Not money.

328
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
You should see this through first.

329
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,060
You have the guts to teach me,

330
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,200
when you didn’t even finish school?

331
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,560
Things like these aren’t about age or experience.

332
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,320
I think

333
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:25,184
I’ve learned this from Mom

334
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:26,936
better than some other sisters.

335
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,976
Just because you think you’re the favorite

336
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:30,392
so you can just do something like this?

337
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,576
I was here to help you today.

338
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,088
You should stop considering me your enemy

339
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,840
and trust in me already.

340
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
The more we trust in each other,

341
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,464
the more we love each other.

342
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,624
I haven’t gotten to ask.

343
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,560
Why did you help me?

344
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,448
Before this,

345
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,664
you tried to kill me

346
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:26,112
and even stalked me.

347
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,672
It was after stalking you

348
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:29,784
that I’ve decided to help.

349
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,744
I think you’re innocent.

350
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,872
I saw you sleepwalking

351
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:39,336
until you encounter your Uncle’s dead body.

352
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,976
If I didn’t get you out of there instantly,

353
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,648
you’d have a hard time trying to get off the hook.

354
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,488
There were no other witnesses apart from me.

355
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:51,568
And you’d probably be coerced into owning up to it.

356
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,520
Then did you see who did it?

357
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,080
I didn’t.

358
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,144
But based on the phone incident,

359
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,896
it’s probably the same one involved in Chatfah’s case.

360
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,568
And so,

361
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,496
are you going to tell me?

362
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,368
What is your relationship with Chatfah?

363
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,568
Chatfah likes to call me “Mangkorn”

364
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,648
because of this tattoo.

365
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,344
I’m someone who loves her so much.

366
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,376
Even more than my own life.

367
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,016
Did Chat really get a boyfriend without us knowing?

368
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,288
But he’s hot

369
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,968
so that’s not surprising.

370
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,744
How did she find him?

371
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:54,752
Tinder?

372
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,560
That’s not the point!

373
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:07,704
Why am I having such thoughts?!

374
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:11,072
The point is, how much can I trust him?

375
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,632
Hey!

376
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:19,688
Oh?

377
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,120
What are you doing?

378
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,520
Um…

379
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,472
Nothing.

380
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,208
I wasn’t doing anything.

381
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,200
So what are we doing next?

382
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,208
You don’t have to do anything

383
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,544
Just wait and see for now.

384
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,616
Wait for what?

385
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,912
Wait for the police to bring a warrant of arrest

386
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,400
and take me away?

387
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,184
Or would you like to turn yourself in now?

388
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,592
With what charge would they arrest you for?

389
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,590
For now, you’re just missing.

390
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,960
They might think you’re in danger.

391
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,352
I don’t know.

392
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,536
But I can’t keep running away like this.

393
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,400
You must not be so familiar with running away.

394
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,000
But for me,

395
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:19,472
I’ve been on a run all my life.

396
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:26,496
Then…

397
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,784
can you tell me how you got to know Chat?

398
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,320
Well, I don’t know how long

399
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:41,320
we’re going to have to be together.

400
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,888
We have to learn more about each other anyway.

401
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,984
Right?

402
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,008
I met Chatfah for the first time in America.

403
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:01,232
Yo!

404
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,008
It’s so fucking easy.

405
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:03,984
Easy?

406
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:05,160
You did fine.

407
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,792
Why did you have to shoot that guy?

408
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:11,032
He saw my face.

409
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,792
Arch, I had no options.

410
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,240
If this works out, we can pull this every month.

411
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:17,240
Every month?

412
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:17,976
Yep.

413
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,656
I can’t do this, man.

414
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:22,600
Fucking–

415
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,568
Shoot!

416
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:25,168
Woah, woah!

417
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,128
I’m sorry, man.

418
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,864
Are you alright?

419
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,552
I saw blood by your door.

420
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,232
Is everything okay?

421
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,208
Oh, it’s just my cat.

422
00:27:32,248 --> 00:27:33,536
Probably…

423
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,288
a scratch from another cat?

424
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,584
Nothing serious.

425
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:40,096
Are you sure?

426
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,760
Yes, I’m sure.

427
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,072
Thank you for checking.

428
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,912
I helped you this time.

429
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,352
Next time,

430
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,768
it’s your turn to help me.

431
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,968
That was the first time I met Chatfah.

432
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,744
I was living my life too much to the extreme.

433
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:07,744
Whichever gang my friend told me to join,

434
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,880
or whatever they told me to do,

435
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,740
I just went with it.

436
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,968
Until I met Chatfah.

437
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,320
Everything changed.

438
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,112
Why?

439
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,768
I feel like,

440
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,112
she's not like any other girl I've met.

441
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,976
She seems strong

442
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:27,340
but inside,

443
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:28,780
she’s very sensitive.

444
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,368
As if she always needs protection.

445
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,776
Yeah.

446
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,848
That’s the real Chatfah.

447
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,168
I’ve never wanted to protect anyone

448
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,592
as much as I want to protect her.

449
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,120
How long are you going to stay in Thailand this time?

450
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,120
Not too long.

451
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,168
I’m just here to run some errands for my Dad.

452
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,552
I’ll go back once I’m done.

453
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,184
What’s up?

454
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,096
I don’t know if we’ll ever get to meet again after this.

455
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,960
Why’d you say that?

456
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,288
I just feel like,

457
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,856
I can always disappear anytime.

458
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,160
Hey.

459
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,248
What’s wrong?

460
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:15,560
Who’s going to do anything to you?

461
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,024
I might have been yearning

462
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:22,544
for something impossible from the start.

463
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,672
You know

464
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,664
how different I am from the rest of the family.

465
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,216
But even so,

466
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,792
I still want to be the sister they love.

467
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,360
Hey.

468
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,928
If no one wants you here anymore,

469
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,568
then you can come and live with me.

470
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,792
I’ll take care of you.

471
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
What if I were to disappear?

472
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:58,140
Would you look for me?

473
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,952
Of course.

474
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,192
I’ll find you no matter what.

475
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,672
That night, we had an appointment.

476
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,320
But Chatfah didn’t show up.

477
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:18,700
So I went to your mansion instead.

478
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,056
That means

479
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,552
you were at the mansion that night?

480
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,568
Yes.

481
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,960
But I didn’t find Chatfah.

482
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,536
I ran into you instead.

483
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,488
I saw you sleepwalking up and down in your room.

484
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,304
So you thought

485
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:43,992
I might have been the culprit?

486
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,568
Maybe when you were unconscious.

487
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,576
That was what I thought then.

488
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,880
And then?

489
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,312
Before that,

490
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:02,368
I saw

491
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,456
someone entering your room

492
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:08,200
before you went to bed.

493
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,568
At that time,

494
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,456
I thought it was normal

495
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:13,460
for her to enter your room.

496
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,032
But based on the fact that

497
00:31:16,064 --> 00:31:17,632
your medicine might have been swapped,

498
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,392
I started to doubt that.

499
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,864
Hey.

500
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,020
Don’t look so shocked.

501
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:39,020
People here would think that you’re scared.

502
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,272
But I’m actually scared.

503
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,200
So

504
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,760
why did you bring me here?

505
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,296
This is where you will get the answer.

506
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,272
What answer?

507
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,720
The answer to

508
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
how I should break out of prison?

509
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,936
Right now,

510
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:03,416
you’re a suspect in a murder case.

511
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,640
You’re no different from them.

512
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,192
Yeah!

513
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,032
The shop’s closed.

514
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,296
I’m just here to deliver food.

515
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,160
In cash?

516
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,544
Who are you running away from this time?

517
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
I’m not running away.

518
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:06,624
I’m looking for someone.

519
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,912
What are you going to do after that?

520
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:10,232
That makes you have to use these.

521
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,192
I brought this medicine to check

522
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:13,968
what’s actually inside.

523
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:25,584
Hey.

524
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:27,296
Who are these people?

525
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,944
Just some black market people.

526
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:31,864
I’m just getting the medicines checked.

527
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,896
Nothing much.

528
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,368
Is it done?

529
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,720
Wasn’t that too fast?

530
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,640
It was fast because

531
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,240
there’s nothing in this.

532
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:51,208
It’s just some flour.

533
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,192
What do you mean?

534
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,736
They’re just normal flour.

535
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:57,128
Just like when you swallow any flour.

536
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,152
It doesn’t have any effect.

537
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,768
No wonder you had a relapse.

538
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,240
You’re right.

539
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,760
I think my condition has relapsed

540
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:09,888
since I went back to the mansion.

541
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,000
But why would Aunty Chom do that?

542
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,224
What do you want?

543
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,208
I want this bitch.

544
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:29,936
Why’re you into my chic?

545
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,984
If she’s just a ‘chic’

546
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,048
then give her up to me.

547
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,008
No big deal.

548
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,000
You could have just asked.

549
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,592
Take her if you want.

550
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,592
Come here.

551
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,272
Ouch!

552
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,368
Hey!

553
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,960
Run!

554
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,080
Go! Go!

555
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,310
Where are you going?!

556
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:37,568
Tell me where your sister is.

557
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,272
What are you talking about?!

558
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,240
Don’t try to fool me.

559
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,176
I know who you are.

560
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:43,976
Tell me where your sister is!

561
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,528
Come here!

562
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:56,336
Where are you going?!

563
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,328
Where were you going to take me?

564
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,368
Answer me!

565
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:10,336
Your sister owes me commission money.

566
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,968
Otherwise, just pay instead of her.

567
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:13,168
Commission for what?

568
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:14,456
I asked you,

569
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:15,648
a commission for what?!

570
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,224
A commission for making her disappear!

571
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,216
Just a disappearance, is it?

572
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,360
You’re so damn rich

573
00:36:29,392 --> 00:36:30,312
but so stingy.

574
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,792
To make someone disappear,

575
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,496
you’ll have to pay more.

576
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,752
After the job is done,

577
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,792
pay the rest of the sum immediately.

578
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,376
It was really her.

579
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,616
She was being a snob and wearing black gloves.

580
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,616
Which one of my sisters?

581
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:01,680
Which one of my sisters?!

582
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,288
Where did you hide Chatfah?

583
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,920
I didn’t hide her.

584
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:06,104
She disappeared on her own.

585
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,928
What do you mean?

586
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,040
She disappeared on her own

587
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:10,752
I have nothing to do with it!

588
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,096
Bua.

589
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,580
They’re here, let’s go.

590
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,136
Which one of my sisters?

591
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,192
Which one of my sisters hired you?!

592
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:18,440
Bua.

593
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,408
Which one of my sisters?!

594
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:20,472
Bua! We have to go!

595
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,104
Hey.

596
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,184
Are you okay?

597
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,040
Hey.

598
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,856
Don’t believe in what he said so much.

599
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:00,392
I don’t know.

600
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,976
I don’t know what I should believe

601
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:10,180
or whom I should trust.

602
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,940
The truth might hurt a little.

603
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,472
But if you want to know who the culprit is,

604
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,568
you just have to try.

605
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:02,368
This place has been vacant for a long time.

606
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,216
I'll try turning the phone on

607
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:05,976
right here.

608
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,128
You can’t do that.

609
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,184
If there’s any signals from this phone,

610
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,024
the police will definitely find out.

611
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,344
At least, we can get Chatfah's information

612
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:19,464
from this phone.

613
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,768
We’ll get everything we’re looking for.

614
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:27,256
Don’t worry.

615
00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:30,312
We will escape before the police come anyway.

616
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:34,976
No.

617
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,760
I’m not worried about that.

618
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,232
I’m worried that

619
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,064
if I found out who did this to me,

620
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,176
I would…

621
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,128
No.

622
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,176
But I don’t want to run anymore.

623
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,816
I want to find out.

624
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,792
(In a dark twilight,)

625
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,984
(a human’s mind might be even darker.)

626
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,552
(Because even though the night is long,)

627
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,376
(it will have to end when the day comes.)

628
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:35,984
Pi.

629
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,200
She’s passed out.

630
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,896
If she didn’t

631
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,736
what would you do to my sister?

632
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,536
I wouldn’t.

633
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,488
I was just trying to scare her.

634
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,776
(But the deep pit in a human’s heart)

635
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,470
(where we can’t fathom,)

636
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,216
(might be cold and dark.)

637
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,128
(And so merciless)

638
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:36,232
(that it’s frightening beyond imagination.)

639
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,272
But I didn’t think it was this sister of yours.

640
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,368
No.

641
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,968
It wasn’t Pi.

642
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,392
I can remember now,

643
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,584
who it was.

644
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,984
Did you happen to have seen who hurt Picha?

645
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,088
Bua.

646
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:28,288
My family has too many secrets.

647
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,848
I will tell you everything.

648
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:31,592
I have destroyed all the evidence for you.

649
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,552
The one who decides your fate is me.

650
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,424
What’s your true identity?

651
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:37,160
Answer me!

652
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:37,760
Hold on.

653
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:38,760
Are you out of your mind, Aunty?

654
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:40,592
You are out of your mind!

655
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,624
Where are you going?

656
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:43,620
You old hag! Let go!
